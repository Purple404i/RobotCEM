Before you read this page,\nanother computer could translate it and several others into a foreign\nlanguage. Electronic \u201cbrains\u201d are taking over chores that include the\ncalculation of everything from automobile parking fees to zero hour for\nspace missile launchings.\n\nDespite bitter winter weather, a recent conference on computers drew\nsome 4,000 delegates to Washington, D.C.; indicating the importance and\nscope of the new industry. The 1962 domestic market for computers and\nassociated equipment is estimated at just under $3 billion, with more\nthan 150,000 people employed in manufacture, operation, and maintenance\nof the machines.\n\nIn the short time since the first electronic computer made its\nappearance, these thinking machines have made such fantastic strides in\nso many different directions that most of us are unaware how much our\nlives are already being affected by them. Banking, for example, employs\ncomplex machines that process checks and handle accounts so much faster\nthan human bookkeepers that they do more than an hour\u2019s work in less\nthan thirty seconds.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _General Electric Co., Computer Dept._\n\n  Programmer at console of computer used in electronic processing of\n    bank checking accounts.\n]\n\nOur government is one of the largest users of computers and\n\u201cdata-processing machines.\u201d The census depends on such equipment, and it\nplayed a part in the development of early mechanical types of computers\nwhen Hollerith invented a punched-card system many years ago. In another\napplication, the post office uses letter readers that scan addresses and\nsort mail at speeds faster than the human eye can keep up with. Many\nmagazines have put these electronic readers to work whizzing through\nmailing lists.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _General Electric Co., Computer Dept._\n\n  Numbers across bottom of check are printed in magnetic ink and can be\n    read by the computer.\n]\n\nIn Sweden, writer Astrid Lindgren received additional royalties for one\nyear of 9,000 _kronor_ because of library loans. Since this was based on\n850,000 total loans of her books from thousands of schools and\nlibraries, the bookkeeping was possible only with an electronic\ncomputer.\n\nComputers are beginning to take over control of factories, steel mills,\nbakeries, chemical plants, and even the manufacture of ice cream. In\nscientific research, computers are solving mathematical and logical\nproblems so complex that they would go forever unsolved if men had to do\nthe work. One of the largest computing systems yet designed,\nincorporating half a million transistors and millions of other parts,\nhandles ticket reservations for the airlines. Others do flight planning\nand air traffic control itself.\n\nGigantic computerized air defense systems like SAGE and NORAD help guard\nus from enemy attack. When John Glenn made his space flight, giant\ncomputers on the ground made the vital calculations to bring him safely\nback. Tiny computers in space vehicles themselves have proved they can\nsurvive the shocks of launching and the environment of space. These\nairborne computers make possible the operation of Polaris, Atlas, and\nMinuteman missiles. Such applications are indicative of the scope of\ncomputer technology today; the ground-based machines are huge, taking up\nrooms and even entire buildings while those tailored for missiles may\nfit in the palm of the hand. One current military project is such an\nairborne computer, the size of a pack of cigarettes yet able to perform\nthousands of mathematical and logical operations a second.\n\nComputers are a vital part of automation, and already they are running\nproduction lines and railroads, making mechanical drawings and weather\npredictions, and figuring statistics for insurance companies as well as\nodds for gamblers. Electronic machines permit the blind to read a page\nof ordinary type, and also control material patterns in knitting mills.\nThis last use is of particular interest since it represents almost a\nfull circle in computer science. Oddly, it was the loom that inspired\nthe first punched cards invented and used to good advantage by the\nFrench designer Jacquard. These homely forerunners of stored information\nsparked the science that now returns to control the mills.\n\nMen very wisely are now letting computers design other computers, and in\none recent project a Bell Laboratories computer did a job in twenty-five\nminutes that would have taken a human designer a month. Even more\nchallenging are the modern-day \u201crobots\u201d performing precision operations\nin industrial plants. One such, called \u201cUnimate,\u201d is simply guided\nthrough the mechanical operations one time, and can then handle the job\nalone. \u201cTransfeRobot 200\u201d is already doing assembly-line work in dozens\nof plants.\n\nThe hope has been expressed that computer extension of our brainpower by\na thousandfold would give our country a lead over potential enemies.\nThis is a rather vain hope, since the United States has no corner on the\ncomputer market. There is worldwide interest in computers, and machines\nare being built in Russia, England, France, Germany, Switzerland,\nHolland, Sweden, Africa, Japan, and other countries. A remarkable\ncomputer in Japan recognizes 8,000 colors and analyzes them instantly.\nComputer translation from one language to another has been mentioned,\nand work is even being done on machines that will permit us to speak\nEnglish into a phone in this country and have it come out French, or\nwhatever we will, overseas! Of course, computers have a terminology all\ntheir own too; words like analog and digital, memory cores, clock rates,\nand so on.\n\nThe broad application of computers has been called the \u201csecond\nindustrial revolution.\u201d What the steam engine did for muscles, the\nmodern computer is beginning to do for our brains. In their slow climb\nfrom caveman days, humans have encountered ever more problems; one of\nthe biggest of these problems eventually came to be merely how to solve\nall the other problems.\n\nAt first man counted on his fingers, and then his toes. As the problems\ngrew in size, he used pebbles and sticks, and finally beads. These\nbecame the abacus, a clever calculating device still in constant use in\nmany parts of the world. Only now, with the advent of low-cost\ncomputers, are the Japanese turning from the _soroban_, their version of\nthe abacus.\n\nThe large-scale computers we are becoming familiar with are not really\nas new as they seem. An Englishman named Babbage built what he called\na \u201cdifference engine\u201d way back in 1831. This complex mechanical\ncomputer cost a huge sum even by today\u2019s standards, and although it\nwas never completed to Babbage\u2019s satisfaction, it was the forerunner\nand model for the successful large computers that began to appear a\nhundred years later. In the meantime, of course, electronics has come\nto the aid of the designer. Today, computer switches operate at\nbillionths-of-a-second speeds and thus make possible the rapid\nhandling of quantities of work like the 14 billion checks we\nAmericans wrote in 1961.\n\nThere are dozens of companies now in the computer manufacturing field,\nproducing a variety of machines ranging in price from less than a\nhundred dollars total price to rental fees of $100,000 a month or more.\nEven at these higher prices the big problem of some manufacturers is to\nkeep up with demand. A $1 billion market in 1960, the computer field is\npredicted to climb to $5 billion by 1965, and after that it is anyone\u2019s\nguess. Thus far all expert predictions have proved extremely\nconservative.\n\nThe path of computer progress is not always smooth. Recently a computer\nwhich had been installed on a toll road to calculate charges was so\nbadly treated by motorists it had to be removed. Another unfortunate\noccurrence happened on Wall Street. A clever man juggled the controls of\na large computer used in stock-market work and \u201cmade\u201d himself a quarter\nof a million dollars, though he ultimately landed in jail for his\nillegal computer button pushing. Interestingly, there is one corrective\ninstitution which already offers a course in computer engineering for\nits inmates.\n\nSo great is the impact of computers that lawyers recently met for a\nthree-day conference on the legal aspects of the new machines. Points\ntaken up included: Can business records on magnetic tape or other\nstorage media be used as evidence? Can companies be charged with\nmismanagement for not using computers in their business? How can\nconfidential material be handled satisfactorily on computers?\n\nAlong with computing machines a whole new technology is growing.\nUniversities and colleges\u2014even high schools\u2014are teaching courses in\ncomputers. And the computer itself is getting into the teaching business\ntoo. The \u201cteaching machine\u201d is one of the most challenging computer\ndevelopments to come along so far. These mechanical professors range\nfrom simple \u201cprogrammed\u201d notebooks, such as the Book of Knowledge and\nEncyclopedia Britannica are experimenting with, to complex computerized\nsystems such as that developed by U.S. Industries, Inc., for the Air\nForce and others.\n\nThe computer as a teaching machine immediately raises the question of\nintelligence, and whether or not the computer has any. Debate waxes hot\non this subject; but perhaps one authority was only half joking when he\nsaid that the computer designer\u2019s competition was a unit about the size\nof a grapefruit, using only a tenth of a volt of electricity, with a\nmemory 10,000 times as extensive as any existing electronic computer.\nThis is a brief description of the human brain, of course.\n\nWhen the first computers appeared, those like ENIAC and BINAC, fiction\nwriters and even some science writers had a field day turning the\nmachines into diabolical \u201cbrains.\u201d Whether or not the computer really\nthinks remains a controversial question. Some top scientists claim that\nthe computer will eventually be far smarter than its human builder;\nequally reputable authorities are just as sure that no computer will\never have an original thought in its head. Perhaps a safe middle road is\nexpressed with the title of this book; namely that the machine is simply\nan extension of the human brain. A high-speed abacus or slide rule, if\nyou will; accurate and foolproof, but a moron nonetheless.\n\nThere are some interesting machine-brain parallels, of course. Besides\nits ability to do mathematics, the computer can perform logical\nreasoning and even make decisions. It can read and translate;\nremembering is a basic part of its function. Scientists are now even\ntalking of making computers \u201cdream\u201d in an attempt to come up with new\nideas!\n\nMore similarities are being discovered or suggested. For instance, the\ninterconnections in a computer are being compared with, and even crudely\npatterned after, the brain\u2019s neurons. A new scientific discipline,\ncalled \u201cbionics,\u201d concerns itself with such studies. Far from being a\none-way street, bionics works both ways so that engineers and biologists\nalike benefit. In fact, some new courses being taught in universities\nare designed to \u201cbridge the gap between engineering and biology.\u201d\n\nAt one time the only learning a computer had was \u201csoldered in\u201d; today\nthe machines are being \u201cforced\u201d to learn by the application of\npunishment or reward as necessary. \u201cFree\u201d learning in computers of the\nPerceptron class is being experimented with. These studies, and\nstatements like those of renowned scientist Linus Pauling that he\nexpects a \u201cmolecular theory\u201d of learning in human beings to be\ndeveloped, are food for thought as we consider the parallels our\nelectronic machines share with us. Psychologists at the University of\nLondon foresee computers not only training humans, but actually watching\nover them and predicting imminent nervous breakdowns in their charges!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory_\n\n  Bank of \u201cassociation\u201d units in Mark I Perceptron, a machine that\n    \u201clearns\u201d from experience.\n]\n\nTo demonstrate their skill many computers play games of tick-tack-toe,\ncheckers, chess, Nim, and the like. A simple electromechanical computer\ndesigned for young people to build can be programmed to play\ntick-tack-toe expertly. Checker- and chess-playing computers are more\nsophisticated, many of them learning as they play and capable of an\noccasional move classed as brilliant by expert human players. The IBM\n704 computer has been programmed to inspect the results of its possible\ndecisions several moves ahead and to select the best choice. At the end\nof the game it prints out the winner and thanks its opponent for the\ngame. Rated as polite, but only an indifferent player by experts, the\ncomputer is much like the checker-playing dog whose master scoffed at\nhim for getting beaten three games out of five. Chess may well be an\nultimate challenge for any kind of brain, since the fastest computer in\noperation today could not possibly work out all the possible moves in a\ngame during a human lifetime!\n\nAs evidenced in the science-fiction treatment early machines got, the\nfirst computers were monsters at least in size. Pioneering design\nefforts on machines with the capacity of the brain led to plans for\nsomething roughly the size of the Pentagon, equipped with its own\nNiagara for power and cooling, and a price tag the world couldn\u2019t\nafford. As often seems to happen when a need arises, though, new\ndevelopments have come along to offset the initial obstacles of size and\ncost.\n\nOne such development was the transistor and other semiconductor devices.\nTiny and rugged, these components require little power. With the old\nvacuum-tubes replaced, computers shrank immediately and dramatically. On\nthe heels of this micro-miniaturization have come new and even smaller\ndevices called \u201cferrite cores\u201d and \u201ccryotrons\u201d using magnetism and\nsupercold temperatures instead of conventional electronic techniques.\n\nAs a result, an amazing number of parts can be packed into a tiny\nvolume. So-called \u201cmolecular electronics\u201d now seems to be a possibility,\nand designers of computers have a gleam in their eyes as they consider\nprogress being made toward matching the \u201cpackaging density\u201d of the\nbrain. This human computer has an estimated 100 billion parts per cubic\nfoot!\n\nWe have talked of reading and translating. Some new computers can also\naccept voice commands and speak themselves. Others furnish information\nin typed or printed form, punched cards, or a display on a tube or\nscreen.\n\nLike us, the computer can be frustrated by a task beyond its\ncapabilities. A wrong command can set its parts clicking rapidly but in\nfutile circles. Early computers, for example, could be panicked by the\norder to divide a number by zero. The solution to that problem of course\nis infinity, and the poor machine had a hard time trying to make such an\nanswer good.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Aeronutronic Division, Ford Motor Co._\n\n  This printed-circuit card contains more than 300 BIAX memory elements.\n    Multiples of such cards mounted in computers store large amounts of\n    information.\n]\n\nThere are other, quainter stories like that of the pioneer General\nElectric computer that simply could not function in the dark. All day\nlong it hummed efficiently, but problems left with it overnight came out\nhorribly botched for no reason that engineers could discover. At last it\nwas found that a light had to be left burning with the scary machine!\nNeon bulbs in the computer were enough affected by light and darkness\nthat the delicate electronic balance of the machine had been upset.\n\nAmong the computer\u2019s unusual talents is the ability to compose music.\nSuch music has been published and is of a quality to give rise to\nthoughtful speculation that perhaps great composers are simply good\nselectors of music. In other words, all the combinations of notes and\nmeter exist: the composer just picks the right ones. No less an\nauthority than Aaron Copland suggests that \u201cwe\u2019ll get our new music by\nfeeding information into an electronic computer.\u201d Not content with\nmerely writing music, some computers can even play a tune. At Christmas\ntime, carols are rendered by computers specially programmed for the\ntask. The result is not unlike a melody played on a pipe organ.\n\nIn an interesting switch of this musical ability on the part of the\nmachine, Russian engineers check the reliability of their computers by\nhaving them memorize Mozart and Grieg. Each part of the complex machines\nis assigned a definite musical value, and when the composition is\n\u201cplayed back\u201d by the computer, the engineer can spot any defects\nexisting in its circuitry. Such computer maintenance would seem to be an\nideal field for the music lover.\n\nIn a playful mood, computers match pennies with visitors, explain their\ninner workings as they whiz through complex mathematics, and are even\ncapable of what is called heuristic reasoning. This amounts to playing\nhunches to reach short-cut solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems. A\nRand Corporation computer named JOHNNIAC demonstrated this recently. It\nwas given some basic axioms and asked to prove some theorems. JOHNNIAC\ncame up with the answers, and in one case produced a proof that was\nsimpler than that given in the text. As one scientist puts it, \u201cIf\ncomputers don\u2019t really think, they at least put on a pretty creditable\nimitation of the real thing.\u201d\n\nComputers are here to stay; this has been established beyond doubt. The\nonly question remaining is how fast the predictions made by dreamers and\nscience-fiction writers\u2014and now by sober scientists\u2014will come to be a\nreality. When we consider that in the few years since the 1953 crop of\ncomputers, their capacity and speed has been increased more than\nfiftyfold, and is expected to jump another thousandfold in two years,\nthese dreams begin to sound more and more plausible.\n\nOne quite probable use for computers is medical diagnosis and\nprescription of treatment. Electronic equipment can already monitor an\nailing patient, and send an alarm when help is needed. We may one day\nsee computers with a built-in bedside manner aiding the family doctor.\n\nThe accomplished inroads of computing machines in business are as\nnothing to what will eventually take place. Already computer\n\u201cgame-playing\u201d has extended to business management, and serious\nexecutives participate to improve their administrative ability. We speak\nof decision-making machines; business decisions are logical applications\nfor this ability. Computers have been given the job of evaluating\npersonnel and assigning salaries on a strictly logical basis. Perhaps\nthis is why in surveys questioning increased use of the machines, each\nexecutive level in general tends to rate the machine\u2019s ability just\nbelow its own.\n\nOther games played by the computer are war games, and computers like\nSAGE are well known. This system not only monitors all air activity but\nalso makes decisions, assigns targets, and then even flies the\ninterceptor planes and guided missiles on their missions. Again in the\nsky, the increase of commercial air traffic has perhaps reached the\nlimit of human ability to control it. Computers are beginning to take\nover here too, planning flights and literally flying the planes.\n\nSurface transport can also be computer-controlled. Railroads are\nbeginning to use the computer techniques, and automatic highways are\ninevitable. Ships also benefit, and special systems coupled to radar can\npredict courses and take corrective action when necessary.\n\nMen seem to have temporarily given up trying to control the weather, but\nusing computers, meteorologists can take the huge mass of data from all\nover the world and make predictions rapidly enough to be of use.\n\nWe have talked of the computer\u2019s giant strides in banking. Its wide use\nin stores is not far off. An English computer firm has designed an\nautomatic supermarket that assembles ordered items, prices them, and\ndelivers them to the check stand. At the same time it keeps a running\ninventory, price record, and profit and loss statement, besides billing\nthe customer with periodic statements. The storekeeper will have only to\nwash the windows and pay his electric power bill.\n\nEven trading stamps may be superseded by computer techniques that keep\ntrack of customer purchases and credit him with premiums as he earns\nthem. Credit cards have helped pioneer computer use in billing; it is\nnot farfetched to foresee the day when we are issued a lifetime,\nall-inclusive credit card\u2014perhaps with our birth certificate!\u2014a card\nwith our thumbprint on it, that will buy our food, pay our rent and\nutilities and other bills. A central computer system will balance our\nexpenses against deposits and from time to time let us know how we stand\nfinancially.\n\nAs with many other important inventions, the computer and its technology\nwere spurred by war and are aided now by continuing threats of war. It\nis therefore pleasant to think on the possibilities of a computer system\n\u201cprogrammed\u201d for peace: a gigantic, worldwide system whose input\nincludes all recorded history of all nations, all economic and cultural\ndata, all weather information and other scientific knowledge. The output\nof such a machine hopefully would be a \u201cbest plan\u201d for all of us. Such a\ncomputer would have no ax to grind and no selfish interests unless they\nwere fed into it.\n\nGiven all the facts, it would punch out for us a set of instructions\nthat would guarantee us the best life possible. This has long been a\ndream of science writers. H. G. Wells was one of these, suggesting a\nworld clearinghouse of information in his book _World Brain_ written in\nthe thirties. In this country, scientist Vannevar Bush suggested a\nsimilar computer called \u201cMemex\u201d which could store huge amounts of data\nand answer questions put to it.\n\nThe huge amounts of information\u2014books, articles, speeches, and records\nof all sorts\u2014are beginning to make it absolutely necessary for an\nefficient information retrieval system. Many cases have been noted in\nwhich much time and effort are spent on a project which has already been\ncompleted but then has become lost in the welter of literature crammed\ninto libraries. The computer is a logical device for such work; in a\nrecent test such a machine scored 86 per cent in its efforts to locate\nspecific data on file. Trained workers rated only 38 per cent in the\nsame test!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _The Boeing Co._\n\n  Engineers using computers to solve complex problems in aircraft\n    design.\n]\n\nThe science of communication is advancing along with that of computers,\nand can help make the dream of a worldwide \u201cbrain\u201d come true. Computers\nin distant cities are now linked by telephone lines or radio, and\nhigh-speed techniques permit the transmission of many thousands of words\nper _second_ across these \u201cdata links.\u201d An interesting sidelight is the\nfact that an ailing computer can be hooked by telephone line with a\nrepair center many miles away and its ailments diagnosed by remote\ncontrol. Communications satellites that are soon to be dotting the sky\nlike tiny moons may well play a big part in computing systems of the\nfuture. Global weather prediction and worldwide coordination of trade\nimmediately come to mind.\n\nWhile we envision such far-reaching applications, let\u2019s not lose sight\nof the possibilities for computer use closer to home\u2014right in our homes,\nas a matter of fact. Just as early inventors of mechanical power devices\ndid not foresee the day when electric drills and saws for hobbyist would\nbe commonplace and the gasoline engine would do such everyday chores as\ncutting the grass in our yards, the makers of computers today cannot\npredict how far the computer will go in this direction. Perhaps we may\none day buy a \u201cLittle Dandy Electro-Brain\u201d and plug it into the wall\nsocket for solving many of the everyday problems we now often guess\nwrong on.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Royal McBee Corp._\n\n  Students at Staples High School, Westport, Connecticut, attend a\n    summer session to learn the techniques of programming and operating\n    an electronic computer.\n]\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _The Saturday Evening Post_\n\n  \u201cHerbert\u2019s been replaced by an electronic brain\u2014one of the simpler\n    types.\u201d\n]\n\nSome years ago a group of experts predicted that by 1967 the world\nchampion chess player would be an electronic computer. No one has yet\nclaimed that we would have a president of metal and wire, but some\ninteresting signposts are being put up. Computers are now used widely to\npredict the result of elections. Computers count the votes, and some\nhave suggested that computers could make it possible for us to vote at\nhome. The government is investigating the effectiveness of a\ndecision-making computer as a stand-by aid for the President in this\ncomplex age we are moving into. No man has the ability to weigh every\nfactor and to make decisions affecting the world. Perhaps a computer can\nserve in an advisory capacity to a president or to a World Council;\nperhaps\u2014\n\nIt is comforting to remember that men will always tell the computer what\nit is supposed to do. No computer will ever run the world any more than\nthe cotton gin or the steam engine or television runs the world. And in\nan emergency, we can always pull out the wallplug, can\u2019t we?\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    \u201c_History is but the unrolled scroll of prophecy._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014James A. Garfield\n\n\n\n\n                         2: The Computer\u2019s Past\n\n\nAlthough it seemed to burst upon us suddenly, the jet airplane can trace\nits beginnings back through the fabric wings of the Wrights to the wax\nwings of Icarus and Daedalus, and the steam aerophile of Hero in ancient\nGreece. The same thing is true of the computer, the \u201cthinking machine\u201d\nwe are just now becoming uncomfortably aware of. No brash upstart, it\nhas a long and honorable history.\n\nNaturalists tell us that man is not the only animal that counts. Birds,\nparticularly, also have an idea of numbers. Birds, incidentally, use\ntools too. We seem to have done more with the discoveries than our\nfeathered friends; at least no one has yet observed a robin with a slide\nrule or a snowy egret punching the controls of an electronic digital\ncomputer. However, the very notion of mere birds being tool and number\nusers does give us an idea of the antiquity and lengthy heritage of the\ncomputer.\n\nThe computer was inevitable when man first began to make his own\nproblems. When he lived as an animal, life was far simpler, and all he\nhad to worry about was finding game and plants to eat, and keeping from\nbeing eaten or otherwise killed himself. But when he began to dabble in\nagriculture and the raising of flocks, when he began to think\nconsciously and to reflect about things, man needed help.\n\nFirst came the hand tools that made him more powerful, the spears and\nbows and arrows and clubs that killed game and enemies. Then came the\ntools to aid his waking brain. Some 25,000 years ago, man began to\ncount. This was no mean achievement, the dim, foggy dawning of the\nconcept of number, perhaps in the caves in Europe where the walls have\nbeen found marked with realistic drawings of bison. Some budding\nmathematical genius in a skin garment only slightly shaggier than his\nmop of hair stared blinking at the drawings of two animals and then\ndropped his gaze to his two hands. A crude, tentative connection jelled\nin his inchoate gray matter and he shook his head as if it hurt. It was\nenough to hurt, this discovery of \u201cnumber,\u201d and perhaps this particular\npioneer never again put two and two together. But others did; if not\nthat year, the next.\n\nArmed with his grasp of numbers, man didn\u2019t need to draw two mastodons,\nor sheep, or whatever. Two pebbles would do, or two leaves or two\nsticks. He could count his children on his fingers\u2014we retain the\nexpression \u201ca handful\u201d to this day, though often our children are\nanother sort of handful. Of course, the caveman did not of a sudden do\nsums and multiplications. When he began to write, perhaps 5,000 years\nlater, he had formed the concept of \u201cone,\u201d \u201ctwo,\u201d \u201cseveral,\u201d and \u201cmany.\u201d\n\nBesides counting his flock and his children, and the number of the\nenemy, man had need for counting in another way. There were the seasons\nof the year, and a farmer or breeder had to have a way of reckoning the\napproach of new life. His calendar may well have been the first\nmathematical device sophisticated enough to be called a computer.\n\nIt was natural that numbers be associated with sex. The calendar was\nrelated to the seasons and the bearing of young. The number three, for\nexample, took on mystic and potent connotation, representing as it did\nman\u2019s genitals. Indeed, numbers themselves came quaintly to have sex.\nOne, three, and the other odd numbers were male; the symmetrical, even\nnumbers logically were female.\n\nThe notion that man used the decimal system because of his ten fingers\nand toes is general, but it was some time before this refinement took\nplace. Some early peoples clung to a simpler system with a base of only\ntwo; and interestingly a tribe of Australian aborigines counts today\nthus: _enea_ (1), _petchaval_ (2), _enea petchaval_ (3), _petchaval\npetchaval_ (4). Before we look down our noses at this na\u00efve system, let\nus consider that high-speed electronic computers use only two values, 1\nand 0.\n\nBut slowly symbols evolved for more and more numbers, numbers that at\nfirst were fingers, and then perhaps knots tied in a strip of hide. This\ncrude counting aid persists today, and cowboys sometimes keep rough\ntallies of a herd by knotting a string for every five that pass. Somehow\nnumbers took on other meanings, like those that figure in courtship in\ncertain Nigerian tribes. In their language, the number six also means \u201cI\nlove you.\u201d If the African belle is of a mind when her boyfriend tenderly\nmurmurs the magic number, she replies in like tone, \u201cEight!\u201d, which\nmeans \u201cI feel the same way!\u201d\n\nFrom the dawn of history there have apparently been two classes of us\nhuman beings, the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave nots.\u201d Nowadays we get bills or\nstatements from our creditors; in early days, when a slate or clay\ntablet was the document, a forerunner of the carbon copy or duplicate\npaper developed. Tallies were marked for the amount of the debt, the\nclay tablet was broken across the marks, and creditor and debtor each\ntook half. No chance for cheating, since a broken half would fit only\nthe proper mate!\n\nNumbers at first applied only to discrete, or distinctly separate,\nthings. The scratches on a calendar, the tallies signifying the count of\na flock; these were more easily reckoned. The idea of another kind of\nnumber inspired the first clocks. Here was a monumental breakthrough in\nmathematics. Nature provided the sunrise that clearly marked the\nbeginning of each day; man himself thought to break the day into\n\u201chours,\u201d or parts of the whole. Such a division led eventually to\nmeasurement of size and weight. Now early man knew not only how many\ngoats he had, but how many \u201chands\u201d high they were, and how many \u201cstones\u201d\nthey weighed. This further division ordained another kind of mechanical\ncomputer man must someday contrive\u2014the analog.\n\nThe first counting machines used were pebbles or sea shells. For the\nStone Age businessman to carry around a handful of rocks for all his\ntransactions was at times awkward, and big deals may well have gone\nunconsummated for want of a stone. Then some genius hit on the idea of\nstringing shells on a bit of reed or hide; or more probably the necklace\ncame first as adornment and the utilitarian spotted it after this style\nnote had been added. At any rate, the portable adding machine became\navailable and our early day accountant grew adroit at sliding the beads\nback and forth on the string. From here it was only a small step, taken\nperhaps as early as 3000 B.C., to the rigid counter known as the abacus.\n\nThe word \u201ccounter\u201d is one we use in everyday conversation. We buy stock\nover the counter; some deals are under the counter. We all know what the\ncounter itself is\u2014that wide board that holds the cash register and\nseparates us from the shopkeeper. At one time the cash register _was_\nthe counter; actually the counting board had rods of beads like the\nabacus, or at least grooves in which beads could be moved. The totting\nup of a transaction was done on the \u201ccounter\u201d; it is still there\nalthough we have forgotten whence came its name.\n\nThe most successful computer used for the next 5,000 years, the portable\ncounter, or the abacus, is a masterpiece of simplicity and\neffectiveness. Though only a frame with several rows of beads, it is\nsophisticated enough that as late as 1947 Kiyoshi Matsuzake of the\nJapanese Ministry of Communications, armed with the Japanese version\u2014a\n_soroban_, bested Private Tom Wood of the U. S. Army of Occupation\npunching the keys of an up-to-the-minute electric calculating machine in\nfour of five problem categories! Only recently have Japanese banks gone\nover to modern calculators, and shopkeepers there and in other lands\nstill conduct business by this rule of thumb and forefinger.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  The abacus, ancient mechanical computer, is still in use in many parts\n    of the world. Here is the Japanese version, the _soroban_, with\n    problem being set up.\n]\n\nThe name abacus comes to us by way of the Greek _abax_, meaning \u201cdust.\u201d\nScholars infer that early sums were done schoolboy fashion in Greece\nwith a stylus on a dusty slate, and that the word was carried over to\nthe mechanical counter. The design has changed but little over the years\nand all abacuses bear a resemblance. The major difference is the number\nof beads on each row, determined by the mathematical base used in the\nparticular country. Some in India, for example, were set up to handle\npounds and shillings for use in shops. Others have a base of twelve. The\nmajority, however, use the decimal system. Each row has seven beads,\nwith a runner separating one or two beads from the others. Some systems\nuse two beads on the narrow side, some only one; this is a mathematical\nconsideration with political implications, incidentally: The Japanese\n_soroban_ has the single-bead design; Korea\u2019s _son pan_ uses two. When\nJapan took over Korea the two-bead models were tabu, and went out of use\nuntil the Koreans were later able to win their independence again.\n\nAbout the only thing added to the ancient abacus in recent years is a\nmovable arrow for marking the decimal point. W. D. Loy patented such a\ngadget in the United States. Today the abacus remains a useful device,\nnot only for business, but also for the teaching of mathematics to\nyoungsters, who can literally \u201cgrasp their numbers.\u201d For that reason it\nought also to be helpful to the blind, and as a therapeutic aid for\nmanual dexterity. Apparently caught up in the trend toward smaller\ncomputers, the abacus has been miniaturized to the extent that it can be\nworn as earrings or on a key chain.\n\nEven with mechanical counters, early mathematicians needed written\nnumbers. The caveman\u2019s straight-line scratches gave way to\nhieroglyphics, to the Sumerian cuneiform \u201cwedges,\u201d to Roman numerals,\nand finally to Hindu and Arabic. Until the numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n8, 9, and that most wonderful of all, 0 or zero, computations of any but\nthe simplest type were apt to be laborious and time-consuming. Even\nthough the Romans and Greeks had evolved a decimal system, their\nnumbering was complex. To count to 999 in Greek required not ten numbers\nbut twenty-seven. The Roman number for 888 was DCCCLXXXVIII. Multiplying\nCCXVII times XXIX yielded an answer of MMMMMMCCXCIII, to be sure, but\nnot without some difficulty. It required an abacus to do any kind of\nmultiplication or division.\n\nIndeed, it was perhaps from the abacus that the clue to Arabic\nsimplicity came. The Babylonians, antedating the Greeks, had\nnevertheless gone them one better in arithmetic by using a \u201cplace\u201d\nsystem. In other words, the position of a number denoted its value. The\nBabylonians simply left an empty space between cuneiform number symbols\nto show an empty space in this positional system. Sometime prior to 300\nB.C. a clever mathematician tired of losing track and punched a dot in\nhis clay tablet to fill the empty space and avoid possible error.\n\nThe abacus shows these empty spaces on its rows of beads, too, and\nfinally the Hindus combined their nine numerals with a \u201cdot with a hole\nin it\u201d and gave the mathematical world the zero. In Hindu it was _sifr_,\ncorrupted to _zephirium_ in Latin, and gives us today both cipher and\nzero. This enigma of nothingness would one day be used by Leibnitz to\nprove that God made the world; it would later become half the input of\nthe electronic computer! Meantime, it was developed independently in\nvarious other parts of the world; the ancient Mayans being one example.\n\nImpressed as we may be by an electronic computer, it may take some\ncharity to recognize its forebears in the scratchings on a rock. To call\nthe calendar a computer, we must in honesty add a qualifying term like\n\u201cpassive.\u201d The same applies to the abacus despite its movable counters.\nBut time, which produced the simple calendar, also furnished the\nincentive for the first \u201cactive\u201d computers too. The hourglass is a\nprimitive example, as is the sundial. Both had an input, a power source,\nand a readout. The clock interestingly ended up with not a decimal\nscheme, but one with a base of twelve. Early astronomers began\nconventionally bunching days into groups of ten, and located different\nstars on the horizon to mark the passage of the ten days. It was but a\nstep from here to use these \u201cdecans,\u201d as they were called, to further\ndivide each night itself into segments. It turned out that 12 decans did\nthe trick, and since symmetry was a virtue the daylight was similarly\ndivided by twelve, giving us a day of 24 hours rather than 10 or 20.\n\nFrom the simple hourglass and the more complex water clocks, the Greeks\nprogressed to some truly remarkable celestial motion computers. One of\nthese, built almost a hundred years before the birth of Christ, was\nrecently found on the sea bottom off the Greek island of Antikythera. It\nhad been aboard a ship which sank, and its discovery came as a surprise\nto scholars since history recorded no such complex devices for that era.\nThe salvaged Greek computer was designed for astronomical work, showing\nlocations of stars, predicting eclipses, and describing various cycles\nof heavenly bodies. Composed of dozens of gears, shafts, slip rings, and\naccurately inscribed plates, it was a computer in the best sense of the\nword and was not exceeded technically for many centuries.\n\nThe Greek engineer Vitruvius made an interesting observation when he\nsaid, \u201cAll machinery is generated by Nature and the revolution of the\nuniverse guides and controls. Our fathers took precedents from\nNature\u2014developed the comforts of life by their inventions. They rendered\nsome things more convenient by machines and their revolutions.\u201d\nHindsight and language being what they are, today we can make a nice\nplay on the word \u201crevolution\u201d as applied to the machine. The Antikythera\ncomputer was a prime example of what Vitruvius was talking about.\nAstronomy was such a complicated business that it was far simpler to\nmake a model of the many motions rather than diagram them or try to\nretain them in his mind.\n\nThere were, of course, some die-hard classicists who decried the use of\nmachines to do the work of pure reasoning. Archytas, who probably\ninvented the screw\u2014or at least discovered its mechanical\nprinciple\u2014attempted to apply such mechanical devices to the solving of\ngeometrical problems. For this he was taken to task by purist Plato who\nsought to preserve the distinct division between \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cmachine.\u201d\n\nYet the syllogistic philosophers themselves, with their major premise,\nminor premise, and conclusion, were unwittingly setting the stage for a\ndifferent kind of computer\u2014the logic machine. Plato would be horrified\ntoday to see crude decks of cards, or simple electromechanical\ncontrivances, solving problems of \u201creason\u201d far faster than he could; in\nfact, as fast as the conditions could be set into them!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                       _The Mechanics of Reason_\n\nAristotle fathered the syllogism, or at least was first to investigate\nit rigorously. He defined it as a formal argument in which the\nconclusion follows logically from the premises. There are four common\nstatements of this type:\n\n                            All S (for is P (for\n                              subject) predicate)\n\n                    No S (for subject) is P\n\n                           Some S (for is P\n                              subject)\n\n                           Some S (for is not P\n                              subject)\n\nThus, Aristotle might say \u201cAll men are mortal\u201d or \u201cNo men are immortal\u201d\nas his subject. Adding an M (middle term), \u201cAristotle is a man,\u201d as a\nminor premise, he could logically go on and conclude \u201cAristotle, being a\nman, is thus mortal.\u201d Of course the syllogism unwisely used, as it often\nis, can lead to some ridiculously silly answers. \u201cAll tables have four\nlegs. Two men have four legs. Thus, two men equal a table.\u201d\n\nDespite the weaknesses of the syllogism, nevertheless it led eventually\nto the science of symbolic logic. The pathway was circuitous, even\ndevious at times, but slowly the idea of putting thought down as letters\nor numbers to be logically manipulated to reach proper conclusions\ngained force and credence. While the Greeks did not have the final say,\nthey did have words for the subject as they did for nearly everything\nelse.\n\nLet us leave the subject of pure logic for a moment and talk of another\nkind of computing machine, that of the mechanical doer of work. In the\n_Iliad_, Homer has Hephaestus, the god of natural fire and metalworking,\nconstruct twenty three-wheeled chariots which propel themselves to and\nfro bringing back messages and instructions from the councils of the\ngods. These early automatons boasted pure gold wheels, and handles of\n\u201ccurious cunning.\u201d\n\nMan has apparently been a lazy cuss from the start and began straightway\nto dream of mechanical servants to do his chores. In an age of magic and\nfear of the supernatural his dreams were fraught with such machines that\nturned into evil monsters. The Hebrew \u201cgolem\u201d was made in the shape of\nman, but without a soul, and often got out of hand. Literature has\nperpetuated the idea of machines running amok, as the broom in \u201cThe\nSorcerer\u2019s Apprentice,\u201d but there have been benevolent machines too.\nTik-Tok, a latter-day windup man in _The Road to Oz_, could think and\ntalk and do many other things men could do. He was not alive, of course,\nbut he had the saving grace of always doing just what he \u201cwas wound up\nto do.\u201d\n\nHaving touched on the subject of mechanical men, let us now return to\nmechanical logic. Since the Greeks, many men have traveled the road of\nreason, but some stand out more brightly, more colorfully, than others.\nSuch a standout was the Spanish monk Ram\u00f3n Lull. Lull was born in 1232.\nA court page, he rose in influence, married young, and had two children,\nbut did not settle down to married domesticity. A wildly reckless\nromantic, he was given to such stunts as galloping his horse into church\nin pursuit of some lady who caught his eye. One such escapade led to a\nremorseful re-examination of himself, and dramatic conversion to\nChristianity.\n\nHe began to write books in conventional praise of Christ, but early in\nhis writings a preoccupation with numbers appears. His _Book of\nContemplation_, for example, actually contains five books for the five\nwounds of the Saviour, and forty subdivisions for the days He spent in\nthe wilderness. There are 365 chapters for daily reading, plus one for\nreading only in leap years! Each chapter has ten paragraphs, symbolizing\nthe ten commandments, and three parts to each chapter. These multiplied\ngive thirty, for the pieces of silver. Beside religious and mystical\nconnotations, geometric terms are also used, and one interesting device\nis the symbolizing of words and even phrases by letters. This ties in\nneatly with syllogism. A sample follows:\n\n\u2026 diversity is shown in the demonstration that the D makes of the E and\nthe F and the G with the I and the K, therefore the H has certain\nscientific knowledge of Thy holy and glorious Trinity.\n\nThis was only prologue to the _Ars Magna_, the \u201cGreat Art\u201d of Ram\u00f3n\nLull. In 1274, the devout pilgrim climbed Mount Palma in search of\ndivine help in his writings. The result was the first recorded attempt\nto use diagrams to discover and to prove non-mathematical truths.\nSpecifically, Lull determined that he could construct mechanical devices\nthat would perform logic to prove the validity of God\u2019s word. Where\nforce, in the shape of the Crusades, had failed, Lull was convinced that\nlogical argument would win over the infidels, and he devoted his life to\nthe task.\n\nRenouncing his estate, including his wife and children, Lull devoted\nhimself thenceforth solely to his Great Art. As a result of dreams he\nhad on Mount Palma, the basis for this work was the assumption of simple\npremises or principles that are unquestionable. Lull arranged these\npremises on rotating concentric circles. The first of these wheels of\nlogic was called A, standing for God. Arranged about the circumference\nof the wheel were sixteen other letters symbolizing attributes of God.\nThe outer wheel also contained these letters. Rotating them produced 240\ntwo-term combinations telling many things about God and His good. Other\nwheels prepared sermons, advised physicians and scientists, and even\ntackled such stumpers as \u201cWhere does the flame go when the candle is put\nout?\u201d\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  From the _Enciclopedia universal illustrada_,\n  Barcelona, 1923\n\n  Lull\u2019s wheel.\n]\n\nUnfortunately for Lull, even divine help did not guarantee him success.\nHe was stoned to death by infidels in Bugia, Africa, at the age of\neighty-three. All his wheelspinning logic was to no avail in advancing\nthe cause of Christianity there, and most mathematicians since have\nscoffed at his na\u00efve devices as having no real merit. Far from accepting\nthe _Ars Magna_, most scholars have been \u201cLulled into a secure sense of\nfalsity,\u201d finding it as specious as indiscriminate syllogism.\n\nYet Lull did leave his mark, and many copies of his wheels have been\nmade and found useful. Where various permutations of numbers or other\nsymbols are required, such a mechanical tool is often the fastest way of\npairing them up. Even in the field of writing, a Lullian device was\npopular a few decades ago in the form of the \u201cPlot Genii.\u201d With this\ngadget the would-be author merely spun the wheels to match up various\ncharacters with interesting situations to arrive at story ideas. Other\nversions use cards to do the same job, and one called Plotto was used by\nits inventor William Wallace Cook to plot countless stories. Although\nthese were perhaps not ideas for great literature, eager writers paid as\nmuch as $75 for the plot boiler.\n\nNot all serious thinkers relegated Lull to the position of fanatic\ndreamer and gadgeteer. No less a mind that Gottfried Wilhelm von\nLeibnitz found much to laud in Lull\u2019s works. The _Ars Magna_ might well\nlead to a universal \u201calgebra\u201d of all knowledge, thought Leibnitz. \u201cIf\ncontroversies were to arise,\u201d he then mused, \u201cthere would be no more\nreason for philosophers to dispute than there would for accountants!\u201d\n\nLeibnitz applied Lull\u2019s work to formal logic, constructed tables of\nsyllogisms from which he eliminated the false, and carried the work of\nthe \u201cgifted crank\u201d at bit nearer to true symbolic logic. Leibnitz also\nextended the circle idea to that of overlapping them in early attempts\nat logical manipulation that foreshadowed the work that John Venn would\ndo later. Leibnitz also saw in numbers a powerful argument for the\nexistence of God. God, he saw as the numeral 1, and 0 was the\nnothingness from which He created the world. There are those, including\nVoltaire whose _Candide_ satirized the notion, who question that it is\nthe best of all possible worlds, but none can question that in the\nseventeenth century Leibnitz foresaw the coming power of the binary\nsystem. He also built arithmetical computers that could add and\nsubtract, multiply and divide.\n\nA few years earlier than Leibnitz, Blaise Pascal was also interested in\ncomputing machines. As a teen-ager working in his father\u2019s tax office,\nPascal wearied of adding the tedious figures so he built himself a\ngear-driven computer that would add eight columns of numbers. A tall\nfigure in the scientific world, Pascal had fathered projective geometry\nat age sixteen and later established hydrodynamics as a science. To\nassist a gambler friend, he also developed the theory of probability\nwhich led to statistical science.\n\nAnother mathematical innovation of the century was that of placing\nlogarithms on a stick by the Scot, John Napier. What he had done, of\ncourse, was to make an analog, or scale model of the arithmetical\nnumbers. \u201cNapier\u2019s bones\u201d quickly became what we now call slide rules,\nforerunners of a whole class of analog computers that solve problems by\nbeing actual models of size or quantity. Newton joined Leibnitz in\ncontributing another valuable tool that would be used in the computer,\nthat of the calculus.\n\n\n                      _The Computer in Literature_\n\nEven as Plato had viewed with suspicion the infringement of mechanical\ndevices on man\u2019s domain of higher thought, other men have continued to\neye the growth of \u201cmechanisms\u201d with mounting alarm. The scientist and\ninventor battled not merely technical difficulties, but the scornful\nsatire and righteous condemnation of some of their fellow men. Jonathan\nSwift, the Irish satirist who took a swipe at many things that did not\nset well with his views, lambasted the computing machine as a substitute\nfor the brain. In Chapter V, Book Three, of _Gulliver\u2019s Travels_, the\ngood dean runs up against a scheming scientist in Laputa:\n\nThe first Professor I saw was in a very large Room, with Forty Pupils\nabout him. After Salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a\nFrame, which took up the greatest part of both the Length and Breadth of\nthe Room; he said, perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a\nProject for improving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanical\nOperations. But the World would soon be sensible of its Usefulness; and\nhe flattered himself, that a more noble exalted Thought never sprang in\nany other Man\u2019s Head. Every one knew how laborious the usual Method is\nof attaining to Arts and Sciences; whereas by his Contrivance, the most\nignorant Person at a reasonable Charge, and with a little bodily Labour,\nmay write Books in Philosophy, Poetry, Politicks, Law, Mathematicks, and\nTheology, without the least Assistance from Genius or Study. He then led\nme to the Frame, about the Sides whereof all his Pupils stood in Ranks.\nIt was a Twenty Foot Square, placed in the Middle of the Room. The\nSuperfices was composed of several Bits of Wood, about the Bigness of a\nDye, but some larger than others. They were all linked together by\nslender Wires. These Bits of Wood were covered on every Square with\nPapers pasted on them; and on these Papers were written all the Words of\ntheir Language in their several Moods, Tenses, and Declensions, but\nwithout any Order. The Professor then desired me to observe, for he was\ngoing to set his Engine to work. The Pupils at his Command took each the\nhold of an Iron Handle, whereof there were Forty fixed round the Edges\nof the Frame; and giving them a sudden Turn, the whole Disposition of\nthe Words was entirely changed. He then commanded Six and Thirty of the\nLads to read the several Lines softly as they appeared upon the Frame;\nand where they found three or four Words together that might make Part\nof a Sentence, they dictated to the four remaining Boys who were\nScribes. This work was repeated three or four Times, and at every Turn\nthe Engine was so contrived, that the Words shifted into new Places, as\nthe square Bits of Wood moved upside down.\n\nSix hours a-day the young Students were employed in this Labour; and the\nProfessor showed me several Volumes in large Folio already collected, of\nbroken Sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those\nrich Materials to give the World a compleat Body of Art and Sciences;\nwhich however might be still improved, and much expedited, if the\nPublick would raise a Fund for making and employing five Hundred such\nFrames in _Lagado_....\n\nFortunately for Swift, who would have been horrified by it, he never\nheard Russell Maloney\u2019s classic story, \u201cInflexible Logic,\u201d about six\nmonkeys pounding away at typewriters and re-creating the world great\nliterature. _Gulliver\u2019s Travels_ is not listed in their accomplishments.\n\nThe French Revolution prompted no less an orator than Edmund Burke to\ndeliver in 1790 an address titled \u201cReflections on the French\nRevolution,\u201d in which he extols the virtues of the dying feudal order in\nEurope. It galled Burke that \u201cThe Age of Chivalry is gone. That of\nsophists, economists, and _calculators_ has succeeded, and the glory of\nEurope is extinguished forever.\u201d\n\nSeventy years later another eminent Englishman named Darwin published a\nbook called _On the Origin of Species_ that in the eyes of many readers\ndid little to glorify man himself. Samuel Butler, better known for his\nnovel, _The Way of All Flesh_, wrote too of the mechanical being, and\nwas one of the first to point out just what sort of future Darwin was\nsuggesting. In the satirical _Erewhon_, he described the machines of\nthis mysterious land in some of the most prophetic writing that has been\ndone on the subject. It was almost a hundred years ago that Butler wrote\nthe first version, called \u201cDarwin Among the Machines,\u201d but the words\nring like those of a 1962 worrier over the electronic brain. Butler\u2019s\ncharacter warns:\n\nThere is no security against the ultimate development of mechanical\nconsciousness in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness\nnow. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made\nduring the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and\nvegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are\ncreatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to\nspeak, in comparison with past time.\n\nDo not let me be misunderstood as living in fear of any actually\nexisting machine; there is probably no known machine which is more than\na prototype of future mechanical life. The present machines are to the\nfuture as the early Saurians to man ... what I fear is the extraordinary\nrapidity with which they are becoming something very different to what\nthey are at present.\n\nButler envisioned the day when the present rude cries with which\nmachines call out to one another will have been developed to a speech as\nintricate as our own. After all, \u201c... take man\u2019s vaunted power of\ncalculation. Have we not engines which can do all manner of sums more\nquickly and correctly than we can? What prizeman in Hypothetics at any\nof our Colleges of Unreason can compare with some of these machines in\ntheir own line?\u201d\n\nNoting another difference in man and his creation, Butler says,\n\n... Our sum-engines never drop a figure, nor our looms a stitch; the\nmachine is brisk and active, when the man is weary, it is clear-headed\nand collected, when the man is stupid and dull, it needs no slumber....\nMay not man himself become a sort of parasite upon the machines? An\naffectionate machine-tickling aphid?\n\nIt can be answered that even though machines should hear never so well\nand speak never so wisely, they will still always do the one or the\nother for our advantage, not their own; that man will be the ruling\nspirit and the machine the servant.... This is all very well. But the\nservant glides by imperceptible approaches into the master, and we have\ncome to such a pass that, even now, man must suffer terribly on ceasing\nto benefit the machines. If all machines were to be annihilated ... man\nshould be left as it were naked upon a desert island, we should become\nextinct in six weeks.\n\nIs it not plain that the machines are gaining ground upon us, when we\nreflect on the increasing number of those who are bound down to them as\nslaves, and of those who devote their whole souls to the advancement of\nthe mechanical kingdom?\n\nButler considers the argument that machines at least cannot copulate,\nsince they have no reproductive system. \u201cIf this be taken to mean that\nthey cannot marry, and that we are never likely to see a fertile union\nbetween two vapor-engines with the young ones playing about the door of\nthe shed, however greatly we might desire to do so, I will readily grant\nit. [But] surely if a machine is able to reproduce another machine\nsystematically, we may say that it has a reproductive system.\u201d\n\nButler repeats his main theme. \u201c... his [man\u2019s] organization never\nadvanced with anything like the rapidity with which that of the machine\nis advancing. This is the most alarming feature of the case, and I must\nbe pardoned for insisting on it so frequently.\u201d\n\nThen there is a startlingly clear vision of the machines \u201cregarded as a\npart of man\u2019s own physical nature, being really nothing but\nextra-corporeal limbs. Man ... as a machinate mammal.\u201d This was feared\nas leading to eventual weakness of man until we finally found \u201cman\nhimself being nothing but soul and mechanism, an intelligent but\npassionless principle of mechanical action.\u201d And so the Erewhonians in\nself-defense destroyed all inventions discovered in the preceding 271\nyears!\n\n\n                       _Early Mechanical Devices_\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, weaving was one of the most competitive\nindustries in Europe, and new inventions were often closely guarded\nsecrets. Just such an idea was that of Frenchman Joseph M. Jacquard, an\nidea that automated the loom and would later become the basis for the\nfirst modern computers. A big problem in weaving was how to control a\nmultiplicity of flying needles to create the desired pattern in the\nmaterial. There were ways of doing this, of course, but all of them were\nunwieldy and costly. Then Jacquard hit on a clever scheme. If he took a\ncard and punched holes in it where he wanted the needles to be actuated,\nit was simple to make the needles do his bidding. To change the pattern\ntook only another card, and cards were cheap. Patented in 1801, there\nwere soon thousands of Jacquard looms in operation, doing beautiful and\naccurate designs at a reasonable price.\n\nTo show off the scope of his wonderful punched cards, Jacquard had one\nof his looms weave a portrait of him in silk. The job took 20,000 cards,\nbut it was a beautiful and effective testimonial. And fatefully a copy\nof the silk portrait would later find its way into the hands of a man\nwho would do much more with the oddly punched cards.\n\nAt about this same time, a Hungarian named Wolfgang von Kempelen decided\nthat machines could play games as well as work in factories. So von\nKempelen built himself a chess-playing machine called the Maelzel Chess\nAutomaton with which he toured Europe. The inventor and his machine\nplayed a great game, but they didn\u2019t play fair. Hidden in the innards of\nthe Maelzel Automaton was a second human player, but this disillusioning\ntruth was not known for some time. Thus von Kempelen doubtless spurred\nother inventors to the task, and in a short while machines would\nactually begin to play the royal game. For instance, a Spaniard named L.\nTorres y Quevedo built a chess-playing machine in 1914. This device\nplayed a fair \u201cend game\u201d using several pieces, and its inventor\npredicted future work in this direction using more advanced machines.\n\nCharles Babbage was an English scientist with a burning desire for\naccuracy. When some mathematical tables prepared for the Astronomical\nSociety proved to be full of errors, he angrily determined to build a\nmachine that would do the job with no mistakes. Of course calculating\nmachines had been built before; but the machine Babbage had in mind was\ndifferent. In fact, he called it a \u201cdifference engine\u201d because it was\nbased on the difference tables of the squares of numbers. The first of\nthe \u201cgiant computers,\u201d it was to have hundreds of gears and shafts,\nratchets and counters. Any arithmetic problem could be set into it, and\nwhen the proper cranks were turned, out would come an answer\u2014the right\nanswer because the machine could not make a mistake. After doing some\npreliminary work on his difference engine, Babbage interested the\ngovernment in his project since even though he was fairly well-to-do he\nrealized it would cost more money than he could afford to sink into the\nproject. Babbage was a respected scientist, Lucasian Professor of\nMathematics at Cambridge, and because of his reputation and the promise\nof the machine, the Chancellor of the Exchequer promised to underwrite\nthe project.\n\nFor four years Babbage and his mechanics toiled. Instead of completing\nhis original idea, the scientist had succeeded only in designing a far\nmore complicated machine, one which would when finished weigh about two\ntons. Because the parts he needed were advanced beyond the state of the\nart of metalworking, Babbage was forced to design and build them\nhimself. In the process he decided that industry was being run all\nwrong, and took time out to write a book. It was an excellent book, a\nsort of forerunner to the modern science of operations research, and\nBabbage\u2019s machine shop was doing wonders for the metalworking art.\n\nUndaunted by the lack of progress toward a concrete result, Babbage was\nthinking bigger and bigger. He was going to scrap the difference engine,\nor rather put it in a museum, and build a far better computer\u2014an\n\u201canalytical engine.\u201d If Jacquard\u2019s punched cards could control the\nneedles on a loom, they could also operate the gears and other parts of\na calculating machine. This new engine would be one that could not only\nadd, subtract, multiply, and divide; it would be designed to control\nitself. And as the answers started to come out, they would be fed back\nto do more complex problems with no further work on the operator\u2019s part.\n\u201cHaving the machine eat its own tail!\u201d Babbage called this sophisticated\nbit of programming. This mechanical cannibalism was the root of the\n\u201cfeedback\u201d principle widely used in machines today. Echoing Watt\u2019s steam\ngovernor, it prophesied the coming control of machines by the machines\nthemselves. Besides this innovation, the machine would have a \u201cstore,\u201d\nor memory, of one thousand fifty-digit numbers that it could draw on,\nand it would actually exercise judgment in selection of the proper\nnumbers. And as if that weren\u2019t enough, it would print out the correct\nanswers automatically on specially engraved copper plates!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Space Technology Laboratories_\n\n  \u201cAs soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the\n    future course of science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid,\n    the question will then arise\u2014by what course of calculation can these\n    results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time?\u201d Charles\n    Babbage\u2014_The Life of a Philosopher_, 1861.\n]\n\nIt was a wonderful dream; a dream that might have become an actuality in\nBabbage\u2019s own time if machine technology had been as advanced as his\nideas. But for Babbage it remained only a dream, a dream that never did\nwork successfully. The government spent \u00a317,000, a huge sum for that day\nand time, and bowed out. Babbage fumed and then put his own money into\nthe machine. His mechanics left him and became leaders in the\nmachine-tool field, having trained in Babbage\u2019s workshops. In despair,\nhe gave up on the analytical engine and designed another difference\nengine. An early model of this one would work to five accurate places,\nbut Babbage had his eyes on a much better goal\u2014twenty-place accuracy. A\nlesser man would have aimed more realistically and perhaps delivered\nworkable computers to the mathematicians and businessmen of the day.\nThere is a legend that his son did finish one of the simpler machines\nand that it was used in actuarial accounting for many years. But Babbage\nhimself died in 1871 unaware of how much he had done for the computer\ntechnology that would begin to flower a few short decades later.\n\nSinglehandedly he had given the computer art the idea of programming and\nof sequential control, a memory in addition to the arithmetic unit he\ncalled a \u201cmill,\u201d and even an automatic readout such as is now standard\non modern computers. Truly, the modern computer was \u201cBabbage\u2019s dream\ncome true.\u201d\n\n\n                            _Symbolic Logic_\n\nConcurrently with the great strides being made with mechanical computers\nthat could handle mathematics, much work was also being done with the\nformalizing of the logic. As hinted vaguely in the syllogisms of the\nearly philosophers, thinking did seem amenable to being diagrammed, much\nlike grammar. Augustus De Morgan devised numerical logic systems, and\nGeorge Boole set up the logic system that has come to be known as\nBoolean algebra in which reasoning becomes positive or negative terms\nthat can be manipulated algebraically to give valid answers.\n\nJohn Venn put the idea of logic into pictures, and simple pictures at\nthat. His symbology looks for all the world like the three interlocking\nrings of a well-known ale. These rings stand for the subject, midterm,\nand predicate of the older Aristotelian syllogism. By shading the\nvarious circles according to the major and minor premises, the user of\nVenn circles can see the logical result by inspection. Implicit in the\nscheme is the possibility of a mechanical or electrical analogy to this\nvisual method, and it was not long until mathematicians began at least\non the mechanical kind. Among these early logic mechanizers,\nsurprisingly, was Lewis Carroll who of course was mathematician Charles\nL. Dodgson before he became a writer.\n\nCarroll, who was a far busier man than most of us ever guess, marketed a\n\u201cGame of Logic,\u201d with a board and colored cardboard counters that\nhandled problems like the following:\n\n               All teetotalers like sugar.\n               No nightingale drinks wine.\n\nBy arranging the counters on Carroll\u2019s game board so that: All M are X,\nand No Y is not-M, we learn that No Y is not-X! This tells the initiate\nlogician that no nightingale dislikes sugar; a handy piece of\ninformation for bird-fancier and sugar-broker alike.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cSymbolic Logic.\u201d\n]\n\nCharles, the third Earl Stanhope, was only slightly less controversial\nthan his prime minister, William Pitt. Scientifically he was far out\ntoo, writing books on electrical theory, inventing steamboats,\nmicroscopes, and printing presses among an odd variety of projects; he\nalso became interested in mechanical logic and designed the \u201cStanhope\nDemonstrator,\u201d a contrivance like a checkerboard with sliding panels. By\nproperly manipulating the demonstrator he could solve such problems as:\n\n               Eight of ten children are bright.\n               Four of these children are boys.\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum number of bright boys? A simple sliding\nof scales on the Stanhope Demonstrator shows that two must be boys and\nas many as four may be. This clever device could also work out\nprobability problems such as how many heads and tails will come up in so\nmany tosses of a coin.\n\nIn 1869 William S. Jevons, an English economist and expert logician,\nbuilt a logic machine. His was not the first, of course, but it had a\nunique distinction in that it solved problems faster than the human\nbrain could! Using Boolean algebra principles, he built a \u201clogical\nabacus\u201d and then even a \u201clogical piano.\u201d By simply pressing the keys of\nthis machine, the user could make the answer appear on its face. It is\nof interest that Jevons thought his machine of no practical use, since\ncomplex logical questions seldom arose in everyday life! Life, it seems,\nwas simpler in 1869 than it is today, and we should be grateful that\nJevons pursued his work through sheer scientific interest.\n\nMore sophisticated than the Jevons piano, the logic machine invented in\nAmerica by Allan Marquand could handle four terms and do problems like\nthe following:\n\n       There are four schoolgirls, Anna, Bertha, Cora, and Dora.\n       When Anna or Bertha, or both, remain home, Cora is at home.\n       When Bertha is out, Anna is out.\n       Whenever Cora is at home, Anna is too.\n       What can we tell about Dora?\n\nThe machine is smart enough to tell us that when Dora is at home the\nother three girls are all at home or out. The same thing is true when\nDora is out.\n\n\n                           _The Census Taker_\n\nMoving from the sophistication of such logic devices, we find a\ntremendous advance in mechanical computers spurred by such a mundane\nchore as the census. The 1880 United States census required seven years\nfor compiling; and that with only 50 million heads to reckon. It was\nplain to see that shortly a ten-year census would be impossible of\ncompletion unless something were done to cut the birth rate or speed the\ncounting. Dr. Herman Hollerith was the man who did something about it,\nand as a result the 1890 census, with 62 million people counted, took\nonly one-third the time of the previous tally.\n\nHollerith, a statistician living in Buffalo, New York, may or may not\nhave heard the old saw about statistics being able to support\nanything\u2014including the statisticians, but there was a challenge in the\nrapid growth of population that appealed to the inventor in him and he\nset to work. He came up with a card punched with coded holes, a card\nmuch like that used by Jacquard on his looms, and by Babbage on the\ndream computer that became a nightmare. But Hollerith did not meet the\nfate of his predecessors. Not stoned, or doomed to die a failure,\nHollerith built his card machines and contracted with the government to\ndo the census work. \u201cIt was a good paying business,\u201d he said. It was\nindeed, and his early census cards would some day be known generically\nas \u201cIBM cards.\u201d\n\nWhile Jacquard and Babbage of necessity used mechanical devices with\ntheir punched cards, Hollerith added the magic of electricity to his\ncard machine, building in essence the first electrical computing\nmachine. The punched cards were floated across a pool of mercury, and\ntelescoping pins in the reading head dropped through the holes. As they\ncontacted the mercury, an electrical circuit was made and another\nAmerican counted. Hollerith did not stop with census work. Sagely he\nfelt there must be commercial applications for his machines and sold two\nof the leading railroads on a punched-card accounting system. His firm\nmerged with others to become the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company,\nand finally International Business Machines. The term \u201cHollerith Coding\u201d\nis still familiar today.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  Hollerith tabulating machine of 1890, forerunner of modern computers.\n]\n\nEdison was illuminating the world and the same electrical power was\nbrightening the future of computing machines. As early as 1915 the Ford\nInstrument Company was producing in quantity a device known as \u201cRange\nKeeper Mark I,\u201d thought to be the first electrical-analog computer. In\n1920, General Electric built a \u201cshort-circuit calculating board\u201d that\nwas an analog or model of the real circuits being tested. Westinghouse\ncame up with an \u201calternating-current network analyzer\u201d in 1933, and this\nanalog computer was found to be a powerful tool for mathematics.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  A vertical punched-card sorter used in 1908.\n]\n\nWhile scientists were putting the machines to work, writers continued to\nprophesy doom when the mechanical man took over. Mary W. Shelley\u2019s\n_Frankenstein_ created a monster from a human body; a monster that in\ntime would take his master\u2019s name and father a long horrid line of other\nfictional monsters. Ambrose G. Bierce wrote of a diabolical\nchess-playing machine that was human enough to throttle the man who beat\nhim at a game. But it remained for the Czech playwright Karel \u010capek to\ngive the world the name that has stuck to the mechanical man. In \u010capek\u2019s\n1921 play, _R.U.R._, for Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots, we are introduced to\nhumanlike workers grown in vats of synthetic protoplasm. _Robota_ is a\nCzech word meaning compulsory service, and apparently these mechanical\nslaves did not take to servitude, turning on their masters and killing\nthem. Robot is generally accepted now to mean a mobile thinking machine\ncapable of action. Before the advent of the high-speed electronic\ncomputer it had little likelihood of stepping out of the pages of a\nnovel or movie script.\n\nAs early as 1885, Allan Marquand had proposed an electrical logic\nmachine as an improvement over his simple mechanically operated model,\nbut it was 1936 before such a device was actually built. In that year\nBenjamin Burack, a member of Chicago\u2019s Roosevelt College psychology\ndepartment, built and demonstrated his \u201cElectrical Logic Machine.\u201d Able\nto test all syllogisms, the Burack machine was unique in another\nrespect. It was the first of the portable electrical computers.\n\nThe compatibility of symbolic logic and electrical network theory was\nbecoming evident at about this time. The idea that yes-no corresponded\nto on-off was beautifully simple, and in 1938 there appeared in one of\nthe learned journals what may fairly be called a historic paper.\nAppearing in _Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical\nEngineers_, \u201cA Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,\u201d was\nwritten by Claude Shannon and was based on his thesis for the M.S.\ndegree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a year earlier. One\nof its important implications was that the programming of a computer was\nmore a logical than an arithmetical operation. Shannon had laid the\ngroundwork for logical computer design; his work made it possible to\nteach the machine not only to add but also to think. Another monumental\npiece of work by Shannon was that on information theory, which\nrevolutionized the science of communications. The author is now on the\nstaff of the electronics research laboratory at M.I.T.\n\nTwo enterprising Harvard undergraduates put Shannon\u2019s ideas to work on\ntheir problems in the symbolic logic class they were taking. Called a\nKalin-Burkhart machine for its builders, this electrical logic machine\ndid indeed work, solving the students\u2019 homework assignments and saving\nthem much tedious paperwork. Interestingly, when certain logical\nquestions were posed for the machine, its circuits went into\noscillation, making \u201ca hell of a racket\u201d in its frustration. The\nbuilders called this an example of \u201cRussell\u2019s paradox.\u201d A typical\nlogical paradox is that of the barber who shaved all men who didn\u2019t\nshave themselves\u2014who shaves the barber? Or of the condemned man\npermitted to make a last statement. If the statement is true, he will be\nbeheaded; if false, he will hang. The man says, \u201cI shall be hanged,\u201d and\nthus confounds his executioners as well as logic, since if he is hanged,\nthe statement is indeed true, and he should have been beheaded. If he is\nbeheaded, the statement is false, and he should have been hanged\ninstead.\n\nWorld War II, with its pressingly complex technological problems,\nspurred computer work mightily. Men like Vannevar Bush, then at Harvard,\nproduced analog computers called \u201cdifferential analyzers\u201d which were\nuseful in solving mathematics involved in design of aircraft and in\nballistics problems.\n\nA computer built by General Electric for the gunsights on the World War\nII B-29 bomber is typical of applications of analog devices for\ncomputing and predicting, and is also an example of early airborne use\nof computing devices. Most computers, however, were sizable affairs. One\nearly General Electric analog machine, described as a hundred feet long,\nindicates the trend toward the \u201cgiant brain\u201d concept.\n\nEven with the sophistication attained, these computers were hardly more\nthan extensions of mechanical forerunners. In other words, gears and\ncams properly proportioned and actuated gave the proper answers whether\nthey were turned by a manual crank or an electrical motor. The digital\ncomputer, which had somehow been lost in the shuffle of interest in\ncomputers, was now appearing on the scientific horizon, however, and in\nthis machine would flower all the gains in computers from the abacus to\nelectrical logic machines.\n\n\n                         _The Modern Computer_\n\nMany men worked on the digital concept. Aiken, who built the\nelectromechanical Mark I at Harvard, and Williams in England are\nrepresentative. But two scientists at the University of Pennsylvania get\nthe credit for the world\u2019s first electronic digital computer, ENIAC, a\n30-ton, 150-kilowatt machine using vacuum tubes and semiconductor diodes\nand handling discrete numbers instead of continuous values as in the\nanalog machine. The modern computer dates from ENIAC, Electronic\nNumerical Integrator And Computer.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Remington Rand UNIVAC_\n\n  ENIAC in operation. This was the first electronic digital computer.\n]\n\nShannon\u2019s work and the thinking of others in the field indicated the\npower of the digital, yes-no, approach. A single switch can only be on\nor off, but many such switches properly interconnected can do amazing\nthings. At first these switches were electromechanical; in the\nEckert-Mauchly ENIAC, completed for the government in 1946, vacuum tubes\nin the Eccles-Jordan \u201cflip-flop\u201d circuit married electronics and the\ncomputer. The progeny have been many, and their generations faster than\nthose of man. ENIAC has been followed by BINAC and MANIAC, and even\nJOHNNIAC. UNIVAC and RECOMP and STRETCH and LARC and a whole host of\nother machines have been produced. At the start of 1962 there were some\n6,000 electronic digital computers in service; by year\u2019s end there will\nbe 8,000. The golden age of the computer may be here, but as we have\nseen, it did not come overnight. The revolution has been slow, gathering\nearly momentum with the golden wheels of Homer\u2019s mechanical\ninformation-seeking vehicles that brought the word from the gods. Where\nit goes from here depends on us, and maybe on the computer itself.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    \u201c_Theory is the guide to practice, and practice is the ratification\n       and life of theory._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014John Weiss\n\n\n\n\n                         3: How Computers Work\n\n\nIn the past decade or so, an amazing and confusing number of computing\nmachines have developed. To those of us unfamiliar with the beast, many\nof them do not look at all like what we imagined computers to be; others\nare even more awesome than the wildest science-fiction writer could\ndream up. On the more complex, lights flash, tape reels spin dizzily,\nand printers clatter at mile-a-minute speeds. We are aware, or perhaps\njust take on faith, that the electronic marvel is doing its sums at so\nmany thousand or million per second, cranking out mathematical proofs\nand processing data at a rate to make mere man seem like the dullest\nslowpoke. Just how computers do this is pretty much of a mystery unless\nwe are of the breed that works with them. Actually, in spite of all the\nblurring speed and seeming magic, the basic steps of computer operation\nare quite simple and generally the same for all types of machines from\nthe modestly priced electromechanical do-it-yourself model to STRETCH,\nMUSE, and other ten-million-dollar computers.\n\nIt might be well before we go farther to learn a few words in the\nlexicon of the computer, words that are becoming more and more a part of\nour everyday language. The following glossary is of course neither\ncomplete nor technical but it will be helpful in following through the\nmechanics of computer operation.\n\n\n                          COMPUTER DICTIONARY\n\nACCESS TIME\u2014Time required for computer to locate data and transfer it\nfrom one computer element to another.\n\nADDER\u2014Device for forming sums in the computer.\n\nADDRESS\u2014Specific location of information in computer memory.\n\nANALOG COMPUTER\u2014A physical or electrical simulator which produces an\nanalogy of the mathematical problem to be solved.\n\nARITHMETIC UNIT\u2014Unit that performs arithmetical and logical operations.\n\nBINARY CODE\u2014Representation of numbers or other information using only\none and zero, to take advantage of open and closed circuits.\n\nBIT\u2014A binary digit, either one or zero; used to make binary numbers.\n\nBLOCK\u2014Group of words handled as a unit, particularly with reference to\ninput and output.\n\nBUFFER\u2014Storage device to compensate for difference in input and\noperation rate.\n\nCONTROL UNIT\u2014Portion of the computer that controls arithmetic and\nlogical operations and transfer of information.\n\nDELAY LINE\u2014Memory device to store and later reinsert information; uses\nphysical, mechanical, or electrical techniques.\n\nDIGITAL COMPUTER\u2014A computer that uses discrete numbers to represent\ninformation.\n\nFLIP-FLOP\u2014A circuit or device which remains in either of two states\nuntil the application of a signal.\n\nGATE\u2014A circuit with more than one input, and an output dependent on\nthese inputs. An AND gate\u2019s output is energized only when all inputs are\nenergized. An OR gate\u2019s output is energized when one or more inputs are\nenergized. There are also NOT-AND gates, EXCLUSIVE-OR gates, etc.\n\nLOGICAL OPERATION\u2014A nonarithmetical operation, i.e., decision-making,\ndata-sorting, searching, etc.\n\nMAGNETIC DRUM\u2014Rotating cylinder storage device for memory unit; stores\ndata in coded form.\n\nMATRIX\u2014Circuitry for transformation of digital codes from one type to\nanother; uses wires, diodes, relays, etc.\n\nMEMORY UNIT\u2014That part of the computer that stores information in machine\nlanguage, using electrical or magnetic techniques.\n\nMICROSECOND\u2014One millionth of a second.\n\nMILLISECOND\u2014One thousandth of a second.\n\nNANOSECOND\u2014One billionth of a second.\n\nPARALLEL OPERATION\u2014Digital computer operation in which all digits are\nhandled simultaneously.\n\nPROGRAMMING\u2014Steps to be executed by computer to solve problem.\n\nRANDOM ACCESS\u2014A memory system that permits more nearly equal access time\nto all memory locations than does a nonrandom system.

There is an engineering\ntechnique called the \u201cblack box\u201d concept, in which we are concerned only\nwith input to this box and its output. We could extend this concept to\n\u201cblack-magic box\u201d and apply it to the computer, but breaking the system\ndown into its components is quite simple and much more informative.\n\nThere are five components that make up a computer: input, control,\narithmetic (or logic) unit, memory, and output. As machine intelligence\nexpert, Dr. W. Ross Ashby, points out, we can get no more out of a\nbrain\u2014mechanical or human\u2014than we put into it. So we must have an input.\nThe kind of input depends largely on the degree of sophistication of the\nmachine we are considering.\n\nWith the abacus we set in the problem mechanically, with our fingers.\nUsing a desk calculator we punch buttons: a more refined mechanical\ninput. Punched cards or perforated tapes are much used input methods. As\ncomputers evolve rapidly, some of them can \u201cread\u201d for themselves and the\ninput is visual. There are also computers that understand verbal\ncommands.\n\nInput should not be confused with the control portion of the computer\u2019s\nanatomy. We feed in data, but we must also tell the computer what to do\nwith the information. Shall it count the number of cards that fly\nthrough it, or shall it add the numbers shown on the cards, record the\nmaximum and minimum, and print out an average? Control involves\nprogramming, a computer term that was among the first to be assimilated\ninto ordinary language.\n\nThe arithmetic unit\u2014that part of the computer that the pioneer Babbage\ncalled his \u201cmill\u201d\u2014is the nuts and bolts end of the business. Here are\nthe gears and shafts, the electromechanical relays, or the vacuum tubes,\ntransistors, and magnetic cores that do the addition, multiplication,\nand other mathematical operations. Sometimes this is called the \u201clogic\u201d\nunit, since often it manipulates the ANDS, ORS, NORS, and other\nconjunctives in the logical algebra of Boole and his followers.\n\nThe memory unit is just that; a place where numbers, words, or other\ndata are stored and ready to be called into use whenever needed. There\nare two broad types of memory, internal and external, and they parallel\nthe kind of memory we use ourselves. While our brain can store many,\nmany facts, it does have a practical limit. This is why we have phone\nbooks, logarithm tables, strings around fingers, and so on. The computer\nlikewise has its external memory that may store thousands of times the\ncapacity of its internal memory. Babbage\u2019s machine could remember a\nthousand fifty-digit numbers; today\u2019s large computers call on millions\nof bits of data.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Conversion of problem to machine program.\n]\n\nAfter we have dumped in the data and told the computer what to do with\nthem, and the arithmetic and memory have collaborated, it remains only\nfor the computer to display the result. This is the output of the\ncomputer, and it can take many forms. If we are using a simple analog\ncomputer such as a slide rule, the answer is found under the hairline on\nthe slide. An electronic computer in a bank prints out the results of\nthe day\u2019s transactions in neat type at hundreds of lines a minute. The\nSAGE defense computer system displays an invading bomber and plots the\ncorrect course for interceptors on a scope; a computer in a playful mood\nmight type out its next move\u2014King to Q7 and checkmate.\n\nWith this sketchy over-all description to get us started, let us study\neach unit in a little more detail. It is interesting to compare these\noperations with those of our human computer, our brain, as we go along.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Remington Rand UNIVAC_\n\n  A large computer, showing the different parts required.\n]\n\n\n                                _Input_\n\nAn early and still very popular method of getting data into the computer\nis the punched card. Jacquard\u2019s clever way of weaving a pattern got into\nthe computer business through Hollerith\u2019s census counting machines.\nToday the ubiquitous IBM card can do these tasks of nose counting and\nweaving, and just about everything else in between. Jacquard used the\npunched holes to permit certain pins to slide through. Hollerith\nsubstituted the mercury electrical contact for the loom\u2019s flying\nneedles. Today there are many other ways of \u201creading\u201d the cards. Metal\nbase plate and springs, star wheels, even photoelectric cells are used\nto detect the presence or absence of the coded holes. A human who knows\nthe code can visually extract the information; a blind man could do it\nby the touch system. So with the computer, there are many ways of\ntransferring data.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Remington Rand_ UNIVAC\n\n  The Computer\u2019s Basic Parts.\n]\n\nAn obvious requirement of the punched card is that someone has to punch\nthe holes in the first place. This is done with manually operated\npunches, power punches, and even automatic machines that handle more\nthan a hundred cards a minute. Punched cards, which fall into the\ncategory called computer \u201csoftware,\u201d are cheap, flexible, and compatible\nwith many types of equipment.\n\nParticularly with mathematical computations and scientific research,\nanother type of input has become popular, that of paper tape. This in\neffect strings many cards together and puts them on an easily handled\nroll. Thus a long series of data can be punched without changing cards,\nand is conveniently stored for repeated use. Remember the old\nplayer-piano rolls of music? These actually formed the input for one\nkind of computer, a musical machine that converted coded holes to\nmusical sounds by means of pneumatic techniques. Later in this chapter\nwe will discuss some modern pneumatic computers.\n\nMore efficient than paper is magnetic tape, the same kind we use in our\nhome recording instruments. Anyone familiar with a tape recorder knows\nhow easy it is to edit or change something on a tape reel. This is a big\nadvantage over punched cards or paper tapes which are physically altered\nby the data stored on them and cannot be corrected. Besides this,\nmagnetic tape can hold many more \u201cbits\u201d of information than paper and\nalso lends itself to very rapid movement through the reading head of the\ncomputer. For example, standard computer tape holds seven tracks, each\nwith hundreds of bits of information per inch. Since there are thousands\nof feet on a ten-inch reel, it is theoretically possible to pack 40\n_million_ bits on this handful of tape!\n\nSince the computer usually can operate at a much higher rate of speed\nthan we can put information onto tape, it is often the practice to have\na \u201cbuffer\u201d in the input section. This receiving station collects and\nstores information until it is full, then feeds it to the computer which\ngobbles it up with lightning speed. Keeping a fast computer continuously\nbusy may require many different inputs.\n\nNever satisfied, computer designers pondered the problem of all the lost\ntime entailed in laboriously preparing cards or tapes for the ravenous\nelectronic machine. The results of this brain-searching are interesting,\nand they are evident in computers that actually read man-talk. Computers\nused in the post office and elsewhere can optically read addresses as\nwell as stamps; banks have computers that electrically read the coded\nmagnetic ink numbers on our checks and process thousands of times as\nmany as human workers once did. This optical reading input is not\nwithout its problems, of course. Many computers require a special type\nface to be used, and the post office found that its stamp recognizer was\nmistaking Christmas seals for foreign stamps. Improved read heads now\ncan read hand-printed material and will one day master our widely\ndiffering human scrawls. This is of course a boon to the \u201cprogrammer\u201d of\nlengthy equations who now has to translate the whole problem into\nmachine talk before the machine can accept it.\n\nIf a machine can read, why can\u2019t it understand verbal input as well?\nLazy computer engineers have pushed this idea, and the simplest input\nsystem of all is well on the way to success. Computers today can\nrecognize numbers and a few words, and the Japanese have a typewriter\nthat prints out the words spoken to it! These linguistic advances that\nelectronic computers are making are great for everyone, except perhaps\nthe glamorized programmer, a new breed of mathematical logician whose\nservices have been demanded in the last few years.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Magnetic Tape - Paper Tape - IBM Card - Magnetic Ink Characters\n]\n\n\n                               _Control_\n\nBefore we feed the problem into the machine, or before we give it some\n\u201craw\u201d data to process, we had better tell our computer what we want it\nto do. All the fantastic speed of our electrons will result in a\nmeaningless merry-go-round, or perhaps a glorious machine-stalling short\ncircuit unless the proper switches open and close at the right time.\nThis is the job of the control unit of the computer, a unit that\nunderstands commands like \u201cstart,\u201d \u201cadd,\u201d \u201csubtract,\u201d \u201cfind the square\nroot,\u201d \u201cfile in Bin B,\u201d \u201cstop,\u201d and so on. The key to all the computer\u2019s\nparts working together in electronic harmony is its \u201cclock.\u201d This\ntimekeeper in effect snaps its fingers in perfect cadence, and the\nswitches jump at its bidding. Since the finger-snapping takes place at\nrates of millions of snaps a second, the programmer must be sure he has\ninstructed the computer properly.\n\nThe ideal programmer is a rare type with a peculiarly keen brain that\nsometimes takes seemingly illogical steps to be logical. Programmers are\nlikely to be men\u2014or women, for there is no sex barrier in this new\nprofession\u2014who revel in symbolic logic and heuristic or \u201chunch\u201d\nreasoning. Without a program, the computer is an impressively elaborate\nand frighteningly expensive contraption which cannot tell one number\nfrom another. The day may come when the mathematician can say to the\nmachine, \u201cProve Fermat\u2019s last theorem for me, please,\u201d or the engineer\nsimply wish aloud for a ceramic material that melts at 15,000\u00b0 C. and\nweighs slightly less than Styrofoam. Even then the human programmer will\nnot start drawing unemployment insurance, of course. If he is not\nreceiving his Social Security pension by then he will simply shift to\nmore creative work such as thinking up more problems for the machine to\nsolve.\n\nJust as there are many jobs for the computer, so there are many kinds of\nprograms. On a very simple, special-purpose computer, the program may be\n\u201cwired-in,\u201d or fixed, so that the computer can do that particular job\nand no other. On a more flexible machine, the program may still be quite\nsimple, perhaps no more than a card entered in a desk unit by an airline\nticket agent to let the computer arrange a reservation for three tourist\nseats on American Airlines jet flight from Phoenix to Chicago at 8:20\nA.M. four days from now. On a general-purpose machine, capable of many\nproblems, the program may be unique, a one-of-a-kind highly complex set\nof instructions that will make the computer tax its huge memory and do\nall sorts of mental \u201cnip-ups\u201d before it reaches a solution.\n\nA computer that understands about sixty commands has been compared to a\nSiamese elephant used for teak logging; the animal has about that many\nwords in its vocabulary. Vocabulary is an indication of computer as well\nas human sophistication. The trend is constantly toward\nless-than-elephant size, and more-than-elephant vocabulary.\n\nThe programmer\u2019s work can be divided into four basic phases: _analysis_\nof the problem; _application_ or matching problem requirements with the\ncapabilities of the right computer; _flow charting_ the various\noperations using symbolic diagrams; and finally, _coding_ or translating\nthe flow chart into language the computer knows.\n\nThe flow chart to some extent parallels the way our own brains solve\nlogic problems, or at least the way they _ought_ to solve them. For\nexample, a computer might be instructed to select the smallest of three\nkeys. It would compare A and B, discard the larger, and then compare\nwith C, finally selecting the proper one. This is of course such a\nridiculously simple problem that few of us would bother to use the\ncomputer since it would take much longer to plot the flow chart than to\nselect the key by simple visual inspection. But the logical principle is\nthe same, even when the computer is to be told to analyze all the\nbusiness transactions conducted by a large corporation during the year\nand advise a program for the next year which will show the most profit.\nFrom the symbolic flow chart, the programmer makes an operational flow\nchart, a detailed block diagram, and finally the program itself.\nSuitably coded in computer language, this program is ready for the\ncomputer\u2019s control unit.\n\nWith a problem of complex nature, such as one involving the firing of a\nspace vehicle, programmers soon learned they were spending hours, or\neven days, on a problem which the computer proceeded to zip through in\nminutes or seconds. It was something like working all year building an\nelaborate Fourth of July fireworks display, touching the match, and\nseeing the whole thing go up in spectacular smoke for a brief moment. Of\ncourse the end justifies the means in either case, and as soon as the\ncomputer has quit whirring, or the skyrockets faded out, the programmer\ngets back to work. But some short cuts were learned.\n\nEven a program for a unique problem is likely to contain many\n\u201csubroutines\u201d just like those in other problems. These are used and\nre-used; some computers now have libraries of programs they can draw on\nmuch as we call on things learned last week or last year.\n\nWith his work completed, the programmer\u2019s only worry is that an error\nmight exist in it, an error that could raise havoc if not discovered.\nOne false bit of logic in a business problem; a slight mathematical\nboner in a design for a manned missile, could be catastrophic since our\ntechnology is so complicated that the mistake might be learned only when\ndisaster struck. So the programmer checks and rechecks his work until he\nis positive _he_ has not erred.\n\nHow about the computer? It checks itself too; so thoroughly that there\nis no danger of it making a mistake. Computer designers have been very\nclever in this respect. One advanced technique is \u201cmajority rule\u201d\nchecking. Not long ago when the abacus was used even in banking, the\nJapanese were aware that a single accountant might make a false move and\nbotch up the day\u2019s tally. But if two operators worked the same problem\nand got the same answer, the laws of probability rule that the answer\ncan be accepted. If the sums do not agree, though, which man is right?\nTo check further, and save the time needed to go through the whole\nproblem again, _three_ abacuses, or abaci, are put through their paces.\nNow if two answers agree, chances are they are the right solution. If\nall three are different, the bank had better hire new clerks!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Remington Rand UNIVAC_\n\n  A word picture \u201cflow chart\u201d of the logical operation of selecting the\n    proper key.\n]\n\n\n                         _Arithmetic or Logic_\n\nNow that our computer has the two necessary ingredients of input and\ncontrol, the arithmetic or logic unit can get busy. Babbage called this\nthe \u201cmill,\u201d and with all the whirring gears and clanking arms his engine\nboasted, the term must have been accurate. Today\u2019s computer is much\nquieter since in electronic switches the only moving parts are the\nelectrons themselves and these don\u2019t make much of a racket. Such\nswitches have another big advantage in that they open and close at a\ngreat rate, practically the speed of light. The fastest computers use\nswitches that act in _nanoseconds_, or billionths of a second. In one\nnanosecond light itself travels only a foot.\n\nThe computer may be likened to someone counting on two of his fingers.\nInstead of the decimal or ten-base system, most computers use binary\narithmetic, which has a base of two. But fingers that can be counted in\nbillionth parts of a second can handle figures pretty fast, and the\ncomputer has learned some clever tricks that further speed things up. It\ncan only add, but by adroit juggling it subtracts by using the\ncomplement of the desired number, a technique known to those familiar\nwith an ordinary adding machine. There are also some tricks to\nmultiplying that allow the computer again to simply add and come up with\nthe answer.\n\nWith pencil and paper we can multiply 117 times 835 easily. Remember,\nthough, that the computer can only add, and that it was once called a\nspeedy imbecile. The most imbecilic computer might solve the problem by\nadding 117 to itself 835 times. A smarter model will reverse the\nprocedure and handle only 117 numbers. The moron type of computer is a\nbit more clever and sets up the problem this way:\n\n                           835\n                           835\n                           835\n                           835\n                           835\n                           835\n                           835\n                          8350\n                         83500\n                         \u2014\u2014\n                         97695\n\nA moment\u2019s reflection will show that this is the same as adding 7 times\n835, 10 times 835, and 100 times 835. And of course the computer arrives\nat the answer in about the time it takes us to start drawing the line\nunder our multiplier.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _The Bendix Corp., Computer Division_\n\n  Assembly of printed-circuit component \u201cpackages\u201d into computer.\n]\n\nPerhaps smarting under the unkind remarks about its mental ability, the\ncomputer has lately been trying some new approaches to the handling of\ncomplex arithmetical problems. Instead of adding long strings of\nnumbers, it will take a guess at the result, do some smart checking,\nadjust its figures, and shortly arrive at the right solution. For\nnonarithmetical problems, the computer substitutes yes and no for 1 and\n0 and blithely solves problems in logic at the same high rate of speed.\n\n\n                                _Memory_\n\nWhen we demonstrated our superiority earlier in multiplying instead of\nadding the numbers in the problem, we were drawing on our memory:\nrecalling multiplication tables committed to memory when we were quite\nyoung. Babbage\u2019s \u201cstore\u201d in his difference engine, you will recall,\ncould memorize a thousand fifty-digit numbers, a feat that would tax\nmost of us. The grandchildren of the Babbage machine can call on as many\nas a billion bits of information stored on tape. As you watch the reels\nof tape spinning, halting abruptly, and spinning again so purposefully,\nremember that the computer is remembering. In addition to its large\nmemory, incidentally, a computer may also have a smaller \u201cscratch-pad\u201d\nmemory to save time.\n\nEarly machines used electromechanical relays or perhaps vacuum-tube\n\u201cflip-flops\u201d for memory. Punched-card files store data too. To speed up\nthe access to information, designers tried the delay-line circuit, a\ndevice that kept information circulating in a mercury or other type of\ndelay. Magnetic drums and discs are also used. Magnetic tape on reels is\nused more than any other memory system for many practical reasons. There\nis one serious handicap with the tape system, however. Information on\nit, as on the drum, disc, file card, or delay line, is serial, that is,\nit is arranged in sequence. To reach a certain needed bit of data might\nrequire running through an entire reel of tape. Even though the tape\nmoves at very high speed, time is lost while the computer\u2019s arithmetic\nunit waits. For this reason the designers of the most advanced computers\nhave gone to \u201crandom access\u201d instead of sequential memory for part of\nthe machine.\n\nTiny cores of ferrite material which has the desired magnetic properties\nare threaded on wires. These become memory elements, as many as a\nhundred of them in an area the size of a postage stamp. Each core is at\nthe intersection of two wires, one horizontal and one vertical. Each\ncore thus has a unique \u201caddress\u201d and because of the arrangement of the\ncore matrix, any address can be reached in about the same amount of time\nas any other. Thus, instead of spinning the tape several hundred feet to\nreach address number 6,564, the computer simply closes the circuit of\nvertical row 65 and horizontal row 64, and there is the desired bit of\ninformation in the form of a magnetic field in the selected core.\n\nHot on the heels of the development of random-access core memories came\nthat of thin metallic film devices and so-called cryogenic or supercold\nmagnetic components that do the same job as the ferrite cores but take\nonly a fraction of the space. Some of these advanced devices also lend\nthemselves to volume production and thus pave the way for memories with\nmore and more information-storage capability.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  Magnetic core plane, the computer\u2019s memory.\n]\n\nIn the realm of \u201cblue-sky\u201d devices, sometimes known as \u201cjournalistors,\u201d\nare molecular block memories. These chunks of material will contain\nmillions of bits of information in cubic inches of volume, and some way\nof three-dimensional scanning of the entire block will be developed.\nWith such a high-volume memory, the computer of tomorrow will fit on a\ndesk top instead of requiring rows and rows of tape-filled machines.\n\nToday, tape offers the cheapest \u201cper bit\u201d storage, and it is necessary\nto use the external or peripheral type of information storage. This is\nnot much of a problem except for the matter of space. Since most\ncomputers are electronic, all that is required to tie the memory units\nto the arithmetic unit is wire connections. Douglas Aircraft ties\ncomputers in its California and North Carolina plants with 2,400 miles\nof telephone hookup. Sometimes even wires are not necessary. In the Los\nAngeles area, North American Aviation has a number of plants separated\nby as many as forty miles. Each plant is quite capable of using the\ncomputers in the other locations, with a stream of digits beamed by\nmicrowave radio from one to the other. Information can be transferred in\nthis manner at rates up to 65,000 bits per second.\n\n\n                                _Output_\n\nOnce the computer has taken the input of information, been instructed\nwhat to do, and used its arithmetic and memory, it has done the bulk of\nthe work on the problem. But it must now reverse the procedure that took\nplace when information flowed into it and was translated into electrical\nimpulses and magnetic currents. It could convey the answer to another\nmachine that spoke its language, but man would find such information\nunintelligible. So the computer has an output section that translates\nback into earth language.\n\nBabbage\u2019s computer was to have printed out its answers on metal plates,\nand many computers today furnish punched cards or tape as an output.\nOthers print the answers on sheets of paper, so rapidly that a page of\nthis book would take little more than a second to produce! One of the\ngreatest challenges of recent years is that of producing printing\ndevices fast enough to exploit fully the terrific speeds of electronic\ncomputing machines. There would be little advantage in a computer that\ncould add all the digits in all the phone books in the world in less\nthan a minute if it took three weeks to print out the answer.\n\nImpact printers, those that actually strike keys against paper, have\nbeen improved to the point where they print more than a thousand lines\nof type, each with 120 characters in it, per minute. But even this is\nnot rapid enough in some instances, and completely new kinds of printers\nhave been developed. One is the Charactron tube, a device combining a\ncathode-ray tube, something like the TV picture tube, with an interposed\n64-character matrix about half an inch in diameter. Electrical impulses\ndeflect the electron beam in the tube so that it passes through the\nproper matrix character and forms that image on the face of the tube.\nThis image then is printed electrostatically on the treated paper rather\nthan with a metal type face. With no moving parts except the paper, and\nof course the electrons themselves, the Charactron printer operates\nclose to the speed of the computer itself, and produces 100,000 words a\nminute. This entire book could be printed out in about forty-five\nseconds in this manner.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Minneapolis-Honeywell,\n  Electronic Data Processing Division_\n\n  A high-speed printer is the output of this computer. It prints 900\n    _lines_ a minute.\n]\n\nThere are many other kinds of outputs. Some are in the form of payroll\nchecks, rushing from the printer at the rate of 10,000 an hour. Some are\nsimply illuminated numbers and letters on the face of the computer. As\nmentioned earlier, the SAGE air defense computer displays the tracks of\naircraft and missiles on large screens, each accurately tagged for\nspeed, altitude, and classification. The computer may even speak its\nanswer to us audibly.\n\nGeneral Electric engineers have programmed computers to play music, and\ncome up with a clever giveaway record titled \u201cChristmas Carols in 210\nTime,\u201d \u00e0 la pipe-organ solo. Some more serious musical work is now being\ndone in taking a musical input fed to a computer, programming it for\nspecial effects including the reverberant effect of a concert hall, and\nhaving that played as the output.\n\nA more direct vocal output is the spoken word. Some computers have this\ncapability now, with a modest vocabulary of their own and an extensive\ntape library to draw from. As an example, Gilfillan Radio has produced a\ncomputerized ground-control-approach system that studies the radar\nreturn of the aircraft being guided, and \u201ctells\u201d the pilot how to fly\nthe landing. All the human operator does is monitor the show.\n\nThe system uses the relatively simple method of selecting the correct\nwords from a previously tape-recorded human voice. More sophisticated\nsystems will be capable of translating code from the computer directly\ninto an audible output. One very obvious advantage of such an automatic\nlanding system is that the computer is never subject to a bad day,\nnerves, or fright. It will talk the aircraft down calmly and\ndispassionately, albeit somewhat mechanically.\n\nThese then are the five basic parts of a computer or computer system:\ninput, control, arithmetic-logic, memory, and output. Remember that this\napplies equally to simple and complex machines, and also to computers\nother than the more generally encountered electronic types. For while\nthe electronic computer is regarded as the most advanced, it is not\nnecessarily the final result of computer development. Let us consider\nsome of the deviants, throwbacks, and mutations of the computer species.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Kearfott Division, General Precision, Inc._\n\n  The tiny black box is capable of the same functions as the larger\n    plastic laboratory model pneumatic digital computer.\n\n  Packaging densities of more than 2,000 elements per cubic inch are\n    expected.\n]\n\n\n                       _Another Kind of Computer_\n\nWe have discussed mechanical, electromechanical, electrical, and\nelectronic computers. There are also those which make use of quite\ndifferent media for their operation: hydraulics, air pressure, and even\nhot gases. The pneumatic is simplest to explain, and also has its\nprecedent in the old player-piano mentioned earlier.\n\nJust as an electric or electronic switch can be open or closed, so can a\npneumatic valve. The analogy carries much further. Some of the basic\nelectronic components used in computers are diodes, capacitors,\ninductors, and \u201cflip-flop\u201d circuits which we have talked of. Each of\nthese, it turns out, can be approximated by pneumatic devices.\n\nThe pneumatic diode is the simplest component, being merely an orifice\nor opening through which gas is flowing at or above the speed of sound.\nUnder these conditions, any disturbance in pressure \u201cupstream\u201d of the\norifice will move \u201cdownstream\u201d through the orifice, but any such\nhappening downstream cannot move upstream. This is analogous to the way\nan electronic diode works in the computer, a one-way valve effect.\n\nThe electrical capacitor with its stored voltage charge plays an\nimportant part in computer circuitry. A plenum chamber, or box holding a\nvolume of air, serves as a pneumatic capacitor. Similarly, the effect of\nan inductor, or coil, is achieved with a long pipe filled with moving\nair.\n\nThe only complicated element in our pneumatic computer building blocks\nis the flip-flop, or bistable element. A system of tubes, orifices, and\nballs makes a device that assumes one position upon the application of\npneumatic force, and the other upon a successive application, similar to\nthe electronic flip-flop. Pneumatic engineers use terms like \u201cpressure\ndrop\u201d and \u201cpneumatic buffering,\u201d comparable to voltage drop and\nelectrical buffering.\n\nA good question at this point is just why computer designers are even\nconsidering pneumatic methods when electronic computers are doing such a\nfine job. There are several reasons that prompt groups like the Kearfott\nDivision of General Precision Inc., AiResearch, IBM\u2019s Swiss Laboratory,\nand the Army\u2019s Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratory to develop the\nair-powered computers. One of these is radiation susceptibility. Diodes\nand transistors have an Achilles heel in that they cannot take much\nradiation. Thus in military applications, and in space work, electronic\ncomputers may be incapable of proper operation under exposure to fallout\nor cosmic rays. A pneumatic computer does not have this handicap.\n\nHigh temperature is another bugaboo of the electronic computer. For\noperation above 100\u00b0 C., for instance, it is necessary to use expensive\nsilicon semiconductor elements. The cryogenic devices we talked of\nrequire extremely low temperatures and are thus also ruled out in hot\nenvironments. The pneumatic computer, on the other hand, can actually\noperate on the exhaust gases of a rocket with temperatures up to 2000\u00b0\nF. There may be something humanlike in this ability to operate on hot\nair, but there are more practical reasons like simplicity, light weight,\nand low cost.\n\nThe pneumatic computer, of course, has limitations of its own. The most\nserious is that of speed, and its top limit seems to be about 100\nkilocycles a second. Although this sounds fast\u2014a kilocycle being a\nthousand cycles, remember\u2014it is tortoise-slow compared with the\n50-megacycle speed of present electronic machines. But within its\nlimitations the pneumatic machine can do an excellent job. Kearfott\nplans shrinking 3,000 pneumatic flip-flops and their power supply and\nall circuitry into a one-inch cube; and packing a medium-size\ngeneral-purpose digital computer complete with memory into a case 5-1/2\ninches square and an inch thick. Such a squeezing of components surely\nindicates _compressed_ air as a logical power supply!\n\nGoing beyond the use of air as a medium, Army researchers have worked\nwith \u201cfluid\u201d flip-flops capable of functioning at temperatures ranging\nfrom minus 100\u00b0 to plus 7,000\u00b0 F.! The limit is dictated only by the\nmaterial used to contain the fluid, and would surely meet requirements\nfor the most rigorous environment foreseeable.\n\nThe fluid flip-flop operates on a different principle from its pneumatic\ncousin, drawing on fluid dynamics to shift from one state to the other.\nFluid dynamics permits the building of switches and amplifiers that\nsimulate electronic counterparts adequately, and the Army\u2019s Diamond\nOrdnance Fuze Laboratory has built such oscillators, shift registers,\nand full adders, the flesh and bones of the computer. Researchers\nbelieve components can be built cheaply and that ultimately a complete\nfluid computer can be assembled.\n\nThe X-15 is cited as an example of a good application for fluid-type\ncomputing devices. The hypersonic aircraft flies so fast it glows, and a\nbig part of its problem is the cooling of a large amount of electronic\nequipment that generates additional heat to compound the difficulty.\nMissiles and space vehicles have similar requirements.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s computer may use liquid helium or a white-hot plasma jet\ninstead of electronics or gas as a medium. It may use a medium nobody\nhas dreamed of yet, or one tried earlier and discarded. Regardless of\nwhat it uses, it will probably work on the same basic theory and\nprinciples we\u2019ve outlined here. And try as we may, we will get no more\nout of it than we put in.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  By Herbert Goldberg \u00a9 1961 Saturday Review\n\n  \u201cIs this your trouble?\u201d\n]\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    \u201c_It is the machines that make life complicated, at the\n    same time that they impose on it a high tempo._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014Carl Lotus Becker\n\n\n\n\n                       4: Computer Cousins\u2014Analog\n                                and Digital\n\n\nThere are many thousands of computers in operation today\u2014in enough\ndifferent outward varieties to present a hopeless classification task to\nthe confused onlooker. Actually there are only two basic types of\ncomputing machines, the analog and the digital. There is also a third\ncomputer, an analog-digital hybrid that makes use of the better features\nof each to do certain jobs more effectively.\n\nThe distinction between basic types is clear-cut and may be explained in\nvery simple terms. Again we go to the dictionary for a starting point.\nWebster says: \u201cAnalogue.\u2014That which is analogous to some other thing.\u201d\nEven without the terminal _ue_, the analog computer is based on the\nprinciple of analogy. It is actually a model of the problem we wish to\nsolve. A tape measure is an analog device; so is a slide rule or the\nspeedometer in your car. These of course are very simple analogs, but\nthe principle of the more complex ones is the same. The analog computer,\nthen, simulates a physical problem and deals in quantities which it can\nmeasure.\n\nSome writers feel that the analog machine is not a computer at all in\nthe strict sense of the word, but actually a laboratory model of a\nphysical system which may be studied and measured to learn certain\nimplicit facts.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Minneapolis-Honeywell Computer Center_\n\n  A multimillion dollar aerospace computer facility. On left is an array\n    of 16 analog computers; at right is a large digital data-processing\n    system.\n\n  The facility can perform scientific and business tasks simultaneously.\n]\n\nThe dictionary also gives us a good clue to the digital computer:\n\u201cDigital.\u2014Of the fingers or digits.\u201d A digital machine deals in digits,\nor discrete units, in its calculations. For instance, if we ask it to\nmultiply 2 times 2, it answers that the product is exactly 4. A slide\nrule, which we have said is an analog device, might yield an answer of\n3.98 or 4.02, depending on the quality of its workmanship and our\neyesight.\n\nThe term \u201cdiscrete\u201d describes the units used by the digital machine; an\nanalog machine deals with \u201ccontinuous\u201d quantities. When you watch the\npointer on your speedometer you see that it moves continuously from zero\nto as fast as you can or dare drive. The gas gauge is a graphic\npresentation of the amount of fuel in the tank, just as the speedometer\nis a picture of your car\u2019s speed. For convenience we interpolate the\nnumbers 10, 20, 30, 1/4, 1/2, and so on. What we do, then, is to convert\nfrom a continuous analog presentation to a digital answer with our eyes\nand brain. This analog-to-digital conversion is not without\ncomplications leading to speeding tickets and the inconvenience of\nrunning out of gas far from a source of supply.\n\nA little thought will reveal that even prior to computers there were two\ndistinct types of calculating; those of measuring (analog) and of\ncounting (digital). Unless we are statisticians, we encounter 2-1/2 men\nor 3-1/2 women about as frequently as we are positive that there is\nexactly 10 gallons of fuel in the gas tank. In fact, we generally use\nthe singular verb with such a figure since the 10 gallons is actually an\narbitrary measurement we have superimposed on a quantity of liquid.\nCounting and measuring, then, are different things.\n\nBecause of the basic differences in the analog and digital computers,\neach has its relative advantages and disadvantages with respect to\ncertain kinds of problems. Let us consider each in more detail and learn\nwhich is better suited to particular tasks. Using alphabetical protocol,\nwe take the analog first.\n\n\n                      _The Analog Measuring Stick_\n\nWe have mentioned the slide rule, the speedometer, and other popular\nexamples of analog computers. There are of course many more. One\nbeautiful example occurs in nature, if we can accept a bit of folklore.\nThe caterpillar is thought by some to predict the severity of the winter\nahead by the width of the dark band about its body. Even if we do not\nbelieve this charming relationship exists, the principle is a fine\nillustration of simulation, or the modeling of a system. Certainly there\nare reverse examples in nature not subject to any speculation at all.\nThe rings in the trunk of a tree are accurate pictures of the weather\nconditions that caused them.\n\nThese analogies in nature are particularly fitting, since the analog\ncomputer is at its best in representing a physical system. While we do\nnot generally recognize such homely examples as computers, automatic\nrecord-changers, washing machines, electric watt-hour meters, and\nsimilar devices are true analogs. So of course is the clock, one of the\nearliest computers made use of by man.\n\nWhile Babbage was working with his difference engine, another\nEnglishman, Lord Kelvin, conceived a brilliant method of predicting the\nheight of tides in various ports. He described his system of solving\ndifferential equations invented in 1876 in the _Proceedings of the Royal\nSociety_. A working model of this \u201cdifferential analyzer,\u201d which put\ncalculus on an automated basis, was built by Kelvin\u2019s brother, James\nThomson. Thomson used mechanical principles in producing this analog\ncomputer, whose parts were discs, balls, and cylinders.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Science Materials Center_\n\n  A simple analog computer designed to be assembled and used by\n    teen-agers. Calculo performs multiplication and division within 5\n    per cent accuracy, and is a useful demonstration device.\n]\n\nEarly electrical analogs of circuits built around 1920 in this country\nhave been discussed briefly in the chapter on the computer\u2019s past. The\nthing that sparked their development was an engineer\u2019s question, \u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t we build a little _model_ of these circuits?\u201d Solving problems in\ncircuitry was almost like playing with toys, using the circuit\nanalyzers, although the toys grew to sizable proportions with hundreds\nof components. Some of the direct-current analog type are still\noperating in Schenectady, New York, and at Purdue University.\n\nA simple battery-powered electric analog gives us an excellent example\nof the principle of all analog machines. Using potentiometers, which\nvary the resistance of the circuit, we set in the problem. The answer is\nread out on a voltmeter. Quite simply, a known input passing through\nknown resistances will result in a proportional voltage. All that\nremains is assigning values to the swing of the voltmeter needle, a\nprocess called \u201cscaling.\u201d For instance, we might let one volt represent\n100 miles, or 50 pounds, or 90 degrees. Obviously, as soon as we have\nset in the problem, the answer is available on the voltmeter. It is this\nfactor that gives the analog computer its great speed.\n\nGeneral Electric and Westinghouse were among those building the\ndirect-current analyzer, and the later alternating-current network type\nwhich came along in the 1930\u2019s. The mechanical analogs were by no means\nforgotten, even with the success of the new electrical machines. Dr.\nVannevar Bush, famous for many other things as well, started work on his\nanalog mechanical differential analyzer in 1927 at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology. Bush drew on the pioneering work of Kelvin and\nother Englishmen, improving the design so that he could do tenth-order\ncalculations.\n\nFollowing Bush\u2019s lead, engineers at General Electric developed further\nrefinements to the \u201cKelvin wheels,\u201d using electrical torque amplifiers\nfor greater accuracy. The complexity of these computers is indicated in\nthe size of one built in the early 1940\u2019s for the University of\nCalifornia. It was a giant, a hundred feet long and filled with\nthousands of parts. Not merely huge, it represented a significant stride\nahead in that it could perform the operation of integration with respect\nto functions other than just time. Instead of being a \u201cdirect\u201d analog,\nthe new machine was an \u201cindirect\u201d analog, a model not of a physical\nthing but of the mathematics expressing it. Engineers realized that the\nmechanical beast, as they called it, represented something of a dinosaur\nin computer evolution and could not survive. Because of its size, it\ncost thousands of dollars merely to prepare a place for its\ninstallation. Besides, it was limited in the scope of its work.\n\nDuring World War II, however, it was all we had, and beast or not, it\nworked around the clock solving engineering problems, ballistics\nequations, and the like. England did work in this field, and\nMeccano\u2014counterpart of the Gilbert Erector Set firm in the United\nStates\u2014marketed a do-it-yourself differential analyzer. The Russians too\nbuilt mechanical differential analyzers as early as 1940.\n\nElectronics came to the rescue of the outsized mechanical analog\ncomputers during and after the war. Paced by firms like Reeves\nInstrument and Goodyear Aircraft, the electronic analog superseded the\nolder mechanical type. There was of course a transitional period, and an\nexample of this stage is the General Electric fire-control computer\ninstalled in the B-29. It embraced mechanical, electrical, and\nelectronic parts to do just the sort of job ideally suited to the analog\ntype of device: that of tracking a path through space and predicting the\nfuture position of a target so that the gunsight aims at the correct\npoint in space for a hit.\n\nAnother military analog computer was the Q-5, used by the Signal Corps\nto locate enemy gun installations. From the track of a projectile on a\nradar screen, the Q-5 did some complicated mathematics to figure\nbackwards and pinpoint the troublesome gun. There were industrial\napplications as well for the analog machine. In the 1950\u2019s, General\nElectric built computers to solve simultaneous linear equations for the\npetroleum industry. To us ultimate users, gasoline poses only one big\nmathematical problem\u2014paying for a tankful. Actually, the control\noperations involved in processing petroleum are terribly involved, and\nthe special analog computer had to handle twelve equations with twelve\nunknown quantities simultaneously. This is the sort of problem that eats\nup man-years of human mathematical time; even a modern digital computer\nhas tough and expensive going, but the analog does this work rapidly and\neconomically.\n\nAnother interesting analog machine was called the Psychological Matrix\nRotation Computer. This implemented an advanced technique called\nmultiple-factor analysis, developed by Thurston of the University of\nIllinois for use in certain psychological work. Multiple-factor analysis\nis employed in making up the attribute tests used by industry and the\nmilitary services for putting the right man in the right job. An\nexcellent method, it was too time-consuming for anything but rough\napproximations until the analog computer was built for it. In effect,\nthe computer worked in twelve dimensions, correlating traits and\naptitudes. It was delivered to the Adjutant General\u2019s Office and is\nstill being used, so Army men who wonder how their background as baker\nqualifies them for the typing pool may have the Psychological Matrix\nRotation Computer to thank.\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, world tension prompted the building of another\nadvanced analog computer, this one a jet engine simulator. Prior to its\nuse, it took about four years to design, build, and test a new jet\nengine. Using the simulator, the time was pared to half that amount. It\nwas a big computer, even though it was electronic. More than 6,000\nvacuum tubes, 1,700 indicator lights, and 2,750 dials were hooked up\nwith more than 25 miles of wire, using about 400,000 interconnections.\nAll of this required quite a bit of electrical power, about what it\nwould take to operate fifty kitchen ranges. But it performed in \u201creal\u201d\ntime, and could keep tabs on an individual molecule of gas from the time\nit entered the jet intake until it was ejected out the afterburner!\n\nOther analog computers were developed for utility companies to control\nthe dispatching of power to various consumers in the most efficient\nmanner. Again the principle was simply to build a model or analog of an\nactual physical system and use it to predict the outcome of operation of\nthat system.\n\nFrom our brief skim of the history of the analog computer we can\nrecognize several things about this type of machine. Since the analog is\na simulator in most cases, we would naturally expect it to be a\nspecial-purpose machine. In other words, if we had a hundred different\nkinds of problems, and had to build a model of each, we would end up\nwith a hundred special-purpose computers. It follows too that the analog\ncomputer will often be a part of the system it serves, rather than a\nseparate piece of equipment.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _The Boeing Co._\n\n  Analog machine used as flight simulator for jet airliner; a means of\n    testing before building.\n]\n\nThere are general-purpose analog computers, of course, designed for\nsolving a broad class of problems. They are usually separate units,\ninstead of part of the system. We can further break down the\ngeneral-purpose analog computer into two types; direct and indirect. A\ndirect analog is exemplified in the tank gauge consisting of a float\nwith a scale attached. An indirect analog, such as the General Electric\nmonster built for the University of California mentioned earlier, can\nuse one dependent variable, such as voltage, to represent all the\nvariables of the prototype. Such an analog machine is useful in\nautomatic control and automation processes.\n\nFinally, we may subdivide our direct analog computer one further step\ninto \u201cdiscrete\u201d analogs or \u201ccontinuous\u201d analogs. The term \u201cdiscrete\u201d is\nthe quality we have ascribed to the digital computer, and a discrete\nanalog is indicative of the overlap that occurs between the two types.\nAnother example of this overlap is the representation of \u201ccontinuous\u201d\nquantities by the \u201cstep-function\u201d method in a digital device. As we\nshall see when we discuss hybrid or analog-digital computers, such\noverlap is as beneficial as it is necessary.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n   _General Motors Corp._\n\n  Large analog computer in rear controls car, subjecting driver to\n    realistic bumps, pitches, and rolls, for working out suspension\n    problems of car.\n]\n\nWe are familiar now with mechanical, electromechanical, and fully\nelectronic analogs. Early machines used rods of certain lengths, cams,\ngears, and levers. Fully electronic devices substitute resistors,\ncapacitors, and inductances for these mechanical components, adding\nvoltages instead of revolutions of shafts, and counting turns of wire in\na potentiometer instead of teeth on a gear. Engineers and technicians\nuse terms like \u201cmixer,\u201d \u201cintegrator,\u201d and \u201crate component,\u201d but we may\nconsider the analog computer as composed of passive networks plus\namplifiers where necessary to boost a faint signal.\n\nSome consideration of what we have been discussing will give us an\nindication of the advantages of the analog computer over the digital\ntype. First and most obvious, perhaps, is that of simplicity. A digital\ndevice for recording temperature could be built; but it would hardly\nimprove on the simplicity of the ordinary thermometer. Speed is another\ndesirable attribute of most analog computers. Since operation is\nparallel, with all parts of the problem being worked on at once, the\nanswer is reached quickly. This is of particular importance in \u201con-line\u201d\napplication where the computer is being used to control, let us say, an\nautomatic machining operation in a factory. Even in a high-speed\nelectronic digital computer there is a finite lag due to the speed of\nelectrons. This \u201cslack\u201d is not present in a direct analog and thus there\nis no loss of precious time that could mean the difference between a\nrejected and a perfect part from the lathe.\n\nIt follows from these very advantages that there are drawbacks too. The\nanalog computer that automatically profiles a propeller blade in a\nmetalworking machine cannot mix paint to specifications or control the\nspeed of a subway train unless it is a very special kind of\ngeneral-purpose analog that would most likely be the size of Grand\nCentral Station and sell for a good part of the national debt. Most\nanalogs have one particular job they are designed for; they are\nspecialists with all the limitations that the word implies.\n\nThere is one other major disadvantage that our analog suffers by its\nvery nature. We can tolerate the approximate answer 3.98 instead of 4,\nbecause most of us recognize the correct product of 2 times 2. But few\nproduction managers would want to use 398 rivets if it took 400 to do\nthe job safely\u2014neither would they want to use 402 and waste material.\nPut bluntly, the analog computer is less accurate than its digital\ncousin. It delivers answers not in discrete units, but approximations,\ndepending on the accuracy of its own parts and its design. Calculo, an\nelectrical-analog computer produced for science students, has an\nadvertised accuracy of 5 per cent at a cost of about $20. The makers\nfrankly call it an \u201cestimator.\u201d This is excellent for illustrating the\nprinciples of analog machines to interested youngsters, but the students\ncould have mathematical accuracy of 100 per cent from a digital computer\ncalled the abacus at a cost of less than a dollar.\n\nGreater accuracy in the analog computer is bought at the expense of\ncostlier components. Up to accuracies of about 1 per cent error it is\nusually cheaper to build an analog device than a digital, assuming such\na degree of accuracy is sufficient, of course. Analog accuracies ten\ntimes the 1 per cent figure are feasible, but beyond that point costs\nrise very sharply and the digital machine becomes increasingly\nattractive from a dollars and cents standpoint. Designers feel that\naccuracies within 0.01 per cent are pushing the barriers of\npracticality, and 0.001 per cent probably represents the ultimate\nachievable. Thus the digital computer has the decided edge in accuracy,\nif we make some realistic allowances. For example, the best digital\nmachine when asked to divide 10 by 3 can never give an exact answer, but\nis bound to keep printing 3\u2019s after the decimal point!\n\nThere are other differences between our two types of computers, among\nthem being the less obvious fact that it is harder to make a\nself-checking analog computer than it is to build the same feature into\nthe digital. However, the most important differences are those of\naccuracy and flexibility.\n\nFor these reasons, the digital computer today is in the ascendant,\nalthough the analog continues to have its place and many are in\noperation in a variety of chores. We have mentioned fire control and the\nB-29 gunsight computer in particular. This was a pioneer airborne\ncomputer, and proved that an analog could be built light enough for such\napplications. However, most fire-control computers are earthbound\nbecause of their size and complexity. A good example is the ballistic\ncomputer necessary for the guns on a battleship. In addition to the\nnormal problem of figuring azimuth and elevation to place a shell on\ntarget, the gun aboard ship has the additional factors of pitch, roll,\nand yaw to contend with. These inputs happen to be ideal for analog\ninsertion, and a properly designed computer makes corrections\ninstantaneously as they are fed into it.\n\nA fertile field for the analog computer from the start was that of\nindustrial process control. Chemical plants, petroleum refineries, power\ngenerating stations, and some manufacturing processes lend themselves to\ncontrol by analog computers. The simplicity and economy of the\n\u201cmodeling\u201d principle, plus the instantaneous operation of the analog,\nmade it suitable for \u201con-line\u201d or \u201con-stream\u201d applications.\n\nThe analog computer has been described as useful in the design of\nengines; it also helps design the aircraft in which these engines are\nused, and even simulates their flight. A logical extension of this use\nis the training of pilots in such flight simulators. One interesting\nanalog simulator built by Goodyear Aircraft Corporation studied the\nreactions of a pilot to certain flight conditions and then was able to\nmake these reactions itself so faithfully that the pilot was unaware\nthat the computer and not his own brain was accomplishing the task.\n\nThe disciplines of geometry, calculus, differential equations, and other\nsimilar mathematics profit from the analog computer which is able to\nmake a model of their curves and configurations and thus greatly speed\ncalculations. Since the analog is so closely tied to the physical rather\nthan the mental world, it cannot cope with discrete numbers, and formal\nlogic is not its cup of tea.\n\nSurely, progress has been made and improvements continue to be designed\ninto modern analog computers. Repetitive operations can now be done\nautomatically at high speed, and the computer even has a memory.\nHigh-speed analog storage permits the machine to make sequential\ncalculations, a job once reserved for the digital computer. But even\nthese advances cannot offset the basic limitations the analog computer\nis heir to.\n\nFewer analog machines are being built now, and many in existence do not\nenjoy the busy schedule of the digital machines. As the mountains of\ndata pile up, created incidentally by computers in the first place, more\ncomputers are needed to handle and make sense of them. It is easier to\ninterpret, store, and transmit digital information than analog; the\ndigital computer therefore takes over this important task.\n\nEven in control systems the digital machine is gaining popularity; its\ntremendous speed offsets its inherent cumbersomeness and its accuracy\ntips the scales more in its favor. These advantages will be more\napparent as we discuss the digital machine on the next pages and explain\nthe trend toward the hybrid machine, ever becoming more useful in the\ncomputer market place. Of course, there will always be a place for the\npure analog\u2014just as there has always been for any specialist, no matter\nwhat his field.\n\n\n                         _The Digital Counter_\n\nThe digital computer was first on the scene and it appears now that it\nwill outnumber and perhaps outlive its analog relative. A simple\ncomputer of this type is as old as man, though it is doubtful that it\nhas been in use that long. Proof of this claim to its pioneering are the\nwords _digit_ and _calculi_, for finger and pebbles, respectively. We\ncounted \u201chow many\u201d before we measured \u201chow large,\u201d and the old Romans\ntallied on fingers until they ran out and then supplemented with\npebbles.\n\nPerhaps the first computations more complex than simple counting of\nwives or flocks came about when some wag found that he could ascertain\nthe number of sheep by counting legs and dividing by four. When it was\nlearned that the thing worked both ways and that the number of pickled\npigs feet was four times the number of pigs processed, arithmetic was\nborn. The important difference between analog and digital, of course, is\nthat the latter is a means of counting, a dealing with discrete numbers\nrather than measuring.\n\nThis kind of computation was taxed sorely when such things as fractions\nand relationships like _pi_ came along, but even then man has managed to\ncontinue dealing with numbers themselves rather than quantity. Just as\nthe slide rule is a handy symbol for the analog computer, the abacus\nserves us nicely to illustrate the digital type, and some schools make a\npractice of teaching simple arithmetic to youngsters in this manner.\n\nOur chapter on the history of the computer touched on early efforts in\nthe digital field, though no stress was laid on the distinction between\ntypes. We might review a bit, and pick out which of the mechanical\ncalculating devices were actually digital. The first obviously was the\nabacus. It was also the only one for a long time. Having discovered the\nprinciple of analogy, man leaned in that direction for many centuries,\nand clocks, celestial simulators, and other devices were analog in\nnature. Purists point out that even the counting machines of Pascal and\nLeibnitz were analog computers, since they dealt with the turning of\nshafts and gears rather than the manipulation of digits. The same\nreasoning has caused some debate about Babbage\u2019s great machines in the\n1800\u2019s, although they are generally considered a digital approach to\nproblem-solving. Perhaps logicians had as much as anyone to do with the\nincreasing popularity of the digital trend when they pointed out the\nadvantages of a binary or two-valued system.\n\nWith the completion in 1946 by Eckert and Mauchly of the electronic\nmarvel they dubbed ENIAC, the modern digital computer had arrived and\nthe floodgates were opened for the thousands of descendants that have\nfollowed. For every analog computer now being built there are dozens or\nperhaps hundreds of digital types. Such popularity must be deserved, so\nlet us examine the creature in an attempt to find the reason.\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Courtesy of the _National Science Foundation_\n\n  The computer family tree. Its remarkable growth began with\n    government-supported research, continued in the universities; and\n    the current generation was developed primarily in private industry.\n]\n\nWe said that by its nature the analog device tended to be a\nspecial-purpose computer. The digital computer, perhaps because its\nbasic operation is so childishly simple, is best suited for\ngeneral-purpose work. It is simple, consisting essentially of switches\nthat are either on or off. Yet Leibnitz found beauty in that simplicity,\nand even the explanation of the universe. Proper interconnection of\nsufficient on-off switches makes possible the most flexible of all\ncomputers\u2014man\u2019s brain. By the same token, man-made computers of the\ndigital type can do a wider variety of jobs than can the analog which\nseemingly is more sophisticated.\n\nA second great virtue of the digital machine is its accuracy. Even a\ntrial machine of Babbage had a 5-place accuracy. This is an error of\nonly one part in ten thousand, achievable in the analog at great\nexpense. This was of course only a preliminary model, and the English\ninventor planned 20-place accuracy in his dream computer. Present\nelectronic digital computers offer 10-place accuracy as commonplace, a\nprecision impossible of achievement in the analog.\n\nWe pointed out in the discussion of analog computers that the complexity\nand expense of increased accuracy was in direct proportion to the degree\nof accuracy desired. Happily for the digital machine, the reverse is\ntrue in its case. Increasing accuracy from five to six figures requires\na premium of one-fifth, or 20 per cent. But jumping from 10-place to\n11-place precision costs us only 10 per cent, and from 20-place to\n21-place drops to just 5 per cent.\n\nActually, such a high degree of accuracy is not necessary in most\npractical applications. For example, the multiplication of 10-digit\nnumbers may yield a 20-digit answer. If we desired, we could increase\nthe capability of our digital computer to twenty digits and give an\naccuracy of one part in 10 million trillion! However, we simply \u201cround\noff\u201d the last ten digits and leave the answer in ten figures, an\naccuracy no analog computer can match. The significant point is that the\nanalog can never hope to compete with digital types for accuracy.\n\nA third perhaps not as important advantage the digital machine has is\nits compactness. We are speaking now of later computers, and not the\npioneer electromechanical giants, of course. The transistor and other\nsmall semiconductor devices supplanted the larger tubes, and magnetic\ncores took the place of cruder storage components. Now even more exotic\ndevices are quietly ousting these, as magnetic films and cryotrons begin\nto be used in computers.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Science Materials Center_\n\n  BRAINIAC, another do-it-yourself computer. This digital machine is\n    here being programmed to solve a logic problem involving a will.\n]\n\nThis drastic shrinking of size by thinking small on the part of computer\ndesigners increases the capacity of the digital computer at no sacrifice\nin accuracy or reliability. The analog, unfortunately, cannot make use\nof many of these solid-state devices. Again, the bugaboo of accuracy is\nthe reason; let\u2019s look further into the problem.\n\nThe most accurate and reliable analog computers are mechanical in\nnature. We can cut gears and turn shafts and wheels to great accuracy\nand operate them in controlled temperature and humidity. Paradoxically,\nthis is because mechanical components are nearer to digital\npresentations than are electrical switches, magnets, and electronic\ncomponents. A gear can have a finite number of teeth; when we deal with\nelectrons flowing through a wire we leave the discrete and enter the\ncontinuous world. A tiny change in voltage or current, or magnetic flux,\ncompounded several hundred times in a complex computer, can change the\nfinal result appreciably if the errors are cumulative, that is, if they\nare allowed to pile up. This is what happens in the analog computer\nusing electrical and electronic components instead of precisely machined\ncams and gears.\n\nThe digital device, on the other hand, is not so penalized. Though it\nuses electronic switches, these can be so set that even an appreciable\nvariation in current or voltage or resistance will not affect the proper\noperation of the switch. We can design a transistor switch, for example,\nto close when the current applied exceeds a certain threshold. We do not\nhave to concern ourselves if this excess current is large or small; the\nswitch will be on, no more and no less. Or it will be completely off.\nJust as there is no such thing as being a little bit dead, there is no\nsuch thing as a partly off digital switch. So our digital computer can\nmake use of the more advanced electronic components to become more\ncomplex, or smaller, or both. The analog must sacrifice its already\nmarginal accuracy if it uses more electronics. The argument here is\nsimplified, of course; there are electronic analog machines in\noperation. However, the problem of the \u201cdrift\u201d of electronic devices is\ninherent and a limiting factor on the performance of the analog.\n\nThese, then, are some of the advantages the digital computer has over\nits analog relative. It is more flexible in general\u2014though there are\n_some_ digital machines that are more specialized than _some_ analog\ntypes; it is more accurate and apparently will remain so; and it is more\namenable to miniaturization and further complexity because its designer\ncan use less than perfect parts and produce a perfect result.\n\nIn the disadvantage department the digital machine\u2019s only drawback seems\nto be its childish way of solving problems. About all it knows how to do\nis to add 1 and 1 and come up with 2. To multiply, it performs\nrepetitive additions, and solving a difficult equation becomes a\nfantastically complex problem when compared with the instantaneous\nsolution possible in the analog machine. The digital computer redeems\nitself by performing its multitudinous additions at fabulous speeds.\n\nBecause it must be fed digits in its input, the digital machine is not\neconomically feasible in many applications that will probably be\nreserved for the analog. A digital clock or thermometer for household\nuse would be an interesting gimmick, but hardly worth the extra trouble\nand expense necessary to produce. Even here, though, first glances may\nbe wrong and in some cases it may prove worth while to convert analog\ninputs to digital with the reverse conversion at the output end. One\nexample of this is the airborne digital computer which has taken over\nmany jobs earlier done by analog devices.\n\nThere is another reason for the digital machines ubiquitousness, a\nreason it does not seem proper to list as merely a relative advantage\nover the analog. We have described the analog computer used as an aid to\npsychological testing procedures, and its ability to handle a\nmultiplicity of problems at once. This perhaps tends to obscure the fact\nthat the digital machine by its very on-off, yes-no nature is ideally\nsuited to the solving of problems in logic. If it achieves superiority\nin mathematics in spite of its seemingly moronic handling of numbers, it\nsucceeds in logic because of this very feature.\n\nWhile it might seem more appropriate that music be composed by analogy,\nor that a chess-playing machine would likely be an analog computer, we\nfind the digital machine in these roles. The reason may be explained by\nour own brains, composed of billions of neurons, each capable only of\nbeing on or off. While many philosophers build a strong case for the\nyes-no-maybe approach with its large areas of gray, the discipline of\nformal logic admits to only two states, those that can so conveniently\nbe represented in the digital computer\u2019s flip-flop or magnetic cores.\n\nThe digital computer, then, is not merely a counting machine, but a\ndecision-maker as well. It can decide whether something should be added,\nsubtracted, or ignored. Its logical manipulations can by clever\ncircuitry be extended from AND to OR, NOT, and NOR. It thus can solve\nnot only arithmetic, but also the problems of logic concerning foxes,\ngoats, and cabbages, or cannibals and missionaries that give us human\nbeings so much trouble when we encounter them.\n\nThe fact that the digital computer is just such a rigorously logical and\nunbending machine poses problems for it in certain of its dealings with\nits human masters. Language ideally should be logical in its structure.\nIn general it probably is, but man is so perverse that he has warped and\ntwisted his communications to the point that a computer sticking\nstrictly to book logic will hit snags almost as soon as it starts to\ntranslate human talk into other human talk, or into a logical machine\ncommand or answer.\n\nFor instance, we have many words with multiple meanings which give rise\nto confusion unless we are schooled in subtleties. There are stories,\nsome of them apocryphal but nonetheless pointing up the problem, of\nterms like \u201cwater goat\u201d cropping up in an English-to-Russian\ntranslation. Investigation proved that the more meaningful term would\nhave been \u201chydraulic ram.\u201d In another interesting experiment, the\nexpression, \u201cthe spirit is willing but the flesh is weak\u201d was machine\ntranslated into Russian, and then that result in turn re-translated back\ninto English much in the manner of the party game of \u201cTelephone\u201d in\nwhich an original message is whispered from one person to another and\nfinally back to the originator. In this instance, the final version was,\n\u201cThe vodka is strong, but the meat is rotten.\u201d\n\nIt is a fine distinction here as to who is wrong, the computer or man\nand his irrational languages. Chances are that in the long run true\nlogic will prevail, and instead of us confusing the computer it will\nmanage instead to organize our grammar into the more efficient tool it\nshould be. With proper programming, the computer may even be able to\nretain sufficient humor and nuance to make talk interesting and colorful\nas well as utilitarian.\n\nWe can see that the digital machine with its flexibility, accuracy, and\npowerful logical capability is the fair-haired one of the computer\nfamily. Starting with _a_ for abacus, digital computer applications run\nthrough practically the entire alphabet. Its take-over in the banking\nfield was practically overnight; it excels as a tool for design and\nengineering, including the design and engineering of other computers.\nAviation relies heavily on digital computers already, from the sale of\ntickets to the control of air traffic.\n\nGaming theory is important not only to the Saturday night poker-player\nand the Las Vegas casino operator, but to military men and\nindustrialists as well. Manufacturing plants rely more and more on\ndigital techniques for controls. Language translation, mentioned lightly\nabove, is a prime need at least until we all begin speaking Esperanto,\nIo, or Computerese. Taxation, always with us, may at least be more\nsmoothly handled when the computers take over. Insurance, the\narrangement of music, spaceflight guidance, and education are random\nfields already dependent more or less on the digital computer. We will\nnot take the time here to go thoroughly into all the jobs for which the\ncomputer has applied for work and been hired; that will be taken up in\nlater chapters. But from even a quick glance the scope of the digital\nmachine already should be obvious. This is why it is usually a safe\nassumption that the word computer today refers to the digital type.\n\n\n                           _Hybrid Computers_\n\nWe have talked of the analog and the digital; there remains a further\nclassification that should be covered. It is the result of a marriage of\nour two basic types, a result naturally hybrid. The analog-digital\ncomputer is third in order of importance, but important nonetheless.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Minneapolis-Honeywell_\n\n  Nerve center of Philadelphia Electric Company\u2019s digital\n    computer-directed automatic economic dispatch system is this console\n    from which power directors operate and supervise loading of\n    generating units at minimum incremental cost.\n]\n\n\nNecessity, as always, mothered the invention of the analog-digital\nmachine. We have talked of the relative merits of the two types; the\nanalog is much faster on a complex problem such as solving simultaneous\nequations. The digital machine is far more accurate. As an example, the\nPsychological Matrix Rotator described earlier could solve its twelve\nequations practically instantaneously. A digital machine might take\nseconds\u2014a terribly long time by computer standards. If we want an\naccurate high-speed differential analyzer, we must combine an analog\nwith a digital computer.\n\nBecause the two are hardly of the same species, this breeding is not an\neasy thing. But by careful study, designers effected the desired mating.\nThe hybrid is not actually a new type of computer, but two different\ntypes tied together and made compatible by suitable converters.\n\nThe composite consists of a high-speed general-purpose digital computer,\nan electronic analog computer, an analog-to-digital converter, a\ndigital-to-analog and a suitable control for these two converters. The\nconverters are called \u201ctransducers\u201d and have the ability of changing the\ncontinuous analog signal into discrete pulses of energy, or vice versa.\n\nSometimes called digital differential analyzers, the hybrid computers\nfeature the ease of programming of the analog, plus its speed, and the\naccuracy and much broader range of the digital machine. Bendix among\nothers produced such machines several years ago. The National Bureau of\nStandards recently began development of what it calls an analog-digital\ndifferential analyzer which it expects to be from ten to a hundred times\nmore accurate than earlier hybrid computers. The NBS analyzer will be\nuseful in missile and aircraft design work.\n\nDespite its apparent usefulness as a compromise and happy medium between\nthe two types, the hybrid would seem to have as limited a future as any\nhybrid does. Pure digital techniques may be developed that will be more\nefficient than the stopgap combination, and the analog-digital will fall\nby the wayside along the computer trail.\n\n\n                               _Summary_\n\nHistorically, the digital computer was first on the scene. The analog\ncame along, and for a time was the more popular for a variety of\nreasons. One of these was the na\u00efve, cumbersome mode of operation the\ndigital computer is bound to; another its early lack of speed. Both\nthese drawbacks have been largely eliminated by advances in electronics,\nand apparently this is only the beginning. In a few years the technology\nhas progressed from standard-size vacuum tubes through miniature tubes\nand the shrinking of other components, to semiconductors and other\ntinier devices, and now we have something called integrated circuitry,\nwith molecular electronics on the horizon. These new methods promise\ncomputer elements approaching the size of the neurons in our own brains,\nyet with far faster speed of operation.\n\nSuch advances help the digital computer more than the analog, barring\nsome unexpected breakthrough in the accuracy problem of the latter.\nDigital building blocks become ever smaller, faster, cheaper, and more\nreliable. Computers that fit in the palm of the hand are on the market,\nand are already bulky by comparison with those in the laboratory. The\nanalog-digital hybrid most likely will not be new life for the analog,\nbut an assimilating of its better qualities by the digital.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u201c\u2018_What\u2019s one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one\nand one and one?_\u2019\n\n\u2018_I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I lost count._\u2019\n\n\u2018_She can\u2019t do Addition,\u2019 the Red Queen interrupted._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014Lewis Carroll\n\n\n\n\n                       5: The Binary Boolean Bit\n\n\nIn this world full of \u201cbigness,\u201d in which astronomical numbers apply not\nonly to the speed of light and the distance to stars but to our national\ndebt as well, it is refreshing to recall that some lucky tribes have a\nmathematical system that goes, \u201cOne\u2014two\u2014plenty!\u201d Such an uncluttered\nlife at times seems highly desirable, and we can only envy those who\nlump all numbers from three to billions as simply \u201cplenty.\u201d\n\nInstead we are faced today with about as many different number systems\nas there are numbers, having come a long way from the dawn of counting\nwhen an even simpler method than \u201cone\u2014two\u2014plenty\u201d prevailed. Man being\nbasically self-centered, he first thought in terms of \u201cme,\u201d or one. Two\nwas not a concept, but two \u201cones\u201d; likewise, three \u201cones\u201d and so on.\nPebbles were handy, and to represent the ten animals slain during the\nwinter, a cave man could make ten scratches on the wall or string out\nthat many stones.\n\nIt is said that the ancient cabbies in Rome had a taximeter that dropped\npebbles one by one onto a plate as the wheels turned the requisite\nnumber of revolutions. This plate of stones was presented to the\npassenger at the end of his ride\u2014perhaps where we get the word \u201cfare\u201d!\nPrices have risen so much that it would take quite a bag of pebbles in\nthe taximeter today.\n\nUsing units in this manner to express a sum is called the unitary\nsystem. It is the concept that gives rise to the \u201cif all the dollars\nspent in this country since such and such a time were laid end to end\u2014\u201d\nanalogies. Put to practice, this might indeed have a salutary effect,\nbut long ago man learned that it was not practical to stick to a\none-for-one representation.\n\nHow long it was before we stumbled onto the fact that we had a \u201chandy\u201d\ncounting system attached to our wrists is not positively known, but we\neventually adopted the decimal system. In some places the jump from one\nto ten was not made completely. The Pueblo Indians, for instance, double\nup one fist each time a sum of five is reached. Thus the doubled fist\nand two fingers on the other hand signifies seven. In the\nmathematician\u2019s language, this is a modulo-5 system. The decimal system\nis modulo-10; in other words we start over each time after reaching 10.\n\nBesides the word digit in our vocabulary to tie fingers and numbers, the\nRoman numerals V and X are graphic representations of one hand with\nthumb widespread, and two hands crossed, respectively. A point worth\nremembering is that the decimal system was chosen arbitrarily because we\nhappen to have ten digits. There is no divine arithmetical significance\nin the number 10; in fact mathematicians would prefer 12, since it can\nbe divided more ways.\n\nThe ancient Mayans, feeling that if 10 were ten times as good as 1, then\nsurely 20 would be twice the improvement of the decimal system. So they\npulled off their boots and added toes to fingers for a modulo-20 number\nsystem. Their word for 20, then, is the same as that for \u201cthe whole man\u201d\nfor very good reason. Other races adopted even larger base systems, the\nbase of 60 being an example.\n\nIf we look to natural reasons for the development of number systems, we\nmight decide that the binary, or two-valued system, did not attain much\nprominence in na\u00efve civilizations because there are so few one-legged,\ntwo-toed animals! Only when man built himself a machine uniquely suited\nto two-valued mathematics did the binary system come into its own.\n\nNumbers are merely conventions, rigorous conventions to be sure with no\nsemantic vagueness. God did not ordain that we use the decimal system,\nas evidenced in the large number of other systems that work just fine.\nSome abacuses use the biquinary system, and there are septal, octal, and\nsexagesimal systems. We can even express numbers in an ABC or XYZ\nnotation. So a broad choice was available for the computer designer when\nhe began to look about for the most efficient system for his new\nmachine.\n\nConsidering only the question of a radix, or base, which will permit the\nfewest elements to represent the desired numbers, mathematicians can\nshow us that a base of not 10, or 12, or any other whole number is most\nefficient, but the fraction 2.71828. The ideal model is not found in\nman, then, since man does not seem to have 2.71828 of anything. However,\nthe strange-looking number does happen to be the base of the system of\nnatural logarithms.\n\nNow a system of mathematics based on 2.71828 might make the most\nefficient use of the components of the computer, but it would play hob\nwith other factors, including the men who must work with such a weird\nset of numbers. As is often done, a compromise was made between ideal\nand practical choices. Since the computer with the most potential seems\nto be the electronic computer, and since its operation hinges on the\nopening and closing of simple or sophisticated switches, a two-valued\nmathematical system, the binary system, was chosen. It wasn\u2019t far from\nthe ideal 2.71828, and there was another even more powerful reason for\nthe choice. Logic is based on a yes-no, true-false system. Here, then,\nwas the best of all possible number systems: the lowly, apparently\nfar-from-sophisticated binary notation. As one writer exclaimed sadly, a\nconcept which had been hailed as a monument to monotheism ended up in\nthe bowels of a robot!\n\n\n                          _The Binary System_\n\nIt is believed from ancient writings that the Chinese were aware of the\nbinary or two-valued system of numbers as early as 3000 B.C. However,\nthis fact was lost as the years progressed, and Leibnitz thought that he\nhad discovered binary himself almost 5,000 years later. In an odd twist,\nLeibnitz apprised his friend Grimaldi, the Jesuit president of the\nTribunal of Mathematics in China, of the religious significance of\nbinary 1 and 0 as an argument against Buddhism!\n\nA legend in India also contains indications of the power of the binary\nsystem. The inventor of the game of chess was promised any award he\nwanted for this service to the king. The inventor asked simply that the\nking place a grain of wheat on the first square of the board, two on the\nsecond, and then four, eight, and so on in ascending powers of two until\nthe sixty-four squares of the board were covered. Although the king\nthought his subject a fool, this amount of wheat would have covered the\nentire earth to a depth of about an inch!\n\nWe are perhaps more familiar with the binary system than we realize.\nMorse code, with its dots and dashes, for example, is a two-valued\nsystem. And the power of a system with a base of two is evident when we\nrealize that given a single one-pound weight and sufficient two-pound\nweights we can weigh _any_ whole-numbered amounts.\n\nAt first glance, however, binary numbers seem a hopeless conglomeration\nof ones and zeros. This is so only because we have become conditioned to\nthe decimal system, which was even more hopeless to us as youngsters. We\nmay have forgotten, with the contempt of familiarity, that our number\nsystem is built on the idea of powers. In grade school we learned that\nstarting at the right we had units, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so\non. In the decimal number 111, for example, we mean 1 times 10^2, plus 1\ntimes 10^1, plus 1. We have handled so many numbers so many times we\nhave usually forgotten just what we are doing, and how.\n\nThe binary system uses only two numbers: 1 and 0. So it is five times as\nsimple as the decimal system. It uses powers of two rather than ten,\nagain far simpler. Let\u2019s take the binary number 111 and break it down\njust as we do a decimal number. Starting at the left, we have 1 times\n2^2, plus 1 times 2^1, plus 1. This adds up to 7, and there is our\nanswer.\n\nThe decimal system is positional; this is what made it so much more\neffective in the simple expression of large numbers than the Roman\nnumeral system. Binary is positional too, and for larger numbers we\ncontinue moving toward the left, increasing our power of two each time.\nThus 1111 is 2^3 plus 2^2 plus 2^1 plus 1.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _System Development Corp._\n\n  A computer teaching machine answering a question about the binary\n    system.\n]\n\nWe are familiar with decimal numbers like 101. This means 1 hundred, no\ntens, and 1 unit. Likewise in binary notation 101 means one 4, no 2\u2019s,\nand one 1. For all its seeming complexity, then, the binary system is\nactually simpler than the \u201ceasy\u201d decimal one we are more familiar with.\nBut despite its simplicity, the binary system is far from being inferior\nto the decimal system. You can prove this by doing some counting on your\nfingers.\n\nNormally we count, or tally, by bending down a finger for each new unit\nwe want to record. With both hands, then, we can add up only ten units,\na quite limited range. We can add a bit of sophistication, and assign a\ndifferent number to each finger; thus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\nNow, believe it or not, we can tally up to 55 with our hands! As each\nunit is counted, we raise and lower the correct finger in turn. On\nreaching 10, we leave that finger\u2014thumb, actually\u2014depressed, and start\nover with 1. On reaching 9, we leave it depressed, and so on. We have\nincreased the capacity of our counting machine by 5-1/2 times without\neven taking off our shoes. The mathematician, by the way, would say we\nhave a capability of not 55 but 56 numbers, since all fingers up would\nsignify 0, which can be called a number. Thus our two hands represent to\nthe mathematician a modulo-56 counter.\n\nThis would seem to vanquish the lowly binary system for good, but let\u2019s\ndo a bit more counting. This time we will assign each finger a number\ncorresponding to the powers of 2 we use in reading our binary numbers.\nThus we assign the numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512.\nHow many units can we count now? Not 10, or 55, but a good bit better\nthan that. Using binary notation, our ten digits can now record a total\nof 1,023 units. True, it will take a bit of dexterity, but by bending\nand straightening fingers to make the proper sums, when you finally have\nall fingers down you will have counted 1,023, or 1,024 if you are a\nmathematical purist.\n\nOnce convinced that the binary method does have its merits, it may be a\nlittle easier to pursue a mastery of representing numbers in binary\nnotation, difficult as it may seem at the outset. The usual way to\nconvert is to remember, or list, the powers of 2, and start at the left\nside with the largest power that can be divided into the decimal number\nwe want to convert. Suppose we want to change the number 500 into\nbinary. First we make a chart of the positions:\n\n     Power of 2                  8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0\n     \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n     Decimal Number            256 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1\n     \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n     Binary Number               1   1   1   1   1   0   1   0   0\n\nSince 256 is the largest number that will go into 500, we start there,\nknowing that there will be nine binary digits, or \u201cbits\u201d in our answer.\nWe place a 1 in that space to indicate that there is indeed an eighth\npower of 2 included in 500. Since 128 will go into the remainder, we put\na 1 in that space also. Continuing in this manner, we find that we need\n1\u2019s until we reach the \u201c8\u201d space which we must skip since our remainder\ndoes not contain an 8. We mark a 1 in the 4 space, but skip the 2 and\nthe 1. Our answer, then, in binary notation is 111110100. This number is\ncalled \u201cpure binary.\u201d It can also lead to pure torture for human\nprogrammers whose eyes begin to bug with this \u201cbit chasing,\u201d as it has\ncome to be called. Everything is of course relative, and the ancient\nRoman might gladly have changed DCCCLXXXVIII to binary 1101111000, which\nis two digits shorter.\n\nThere is a simpler way of converting that might be interesting to try\nout. We\u2019ll start with our same 500. Since it is an even number, we put a\n0 beneath it. Moving to the left, we divide by two and get 250. This\nalso is an even number, so we mark down a 0 in our binary equivalent.\nThe next division gives 125, an odd number, so we put down a 1. We\ncontinue to divide successively, marking a zero for each even remainder,\nand a 1 for the odd. Although it may not be obvious right away, we are\nmerely arriving at powers of two by a process called mediation, or\nhalving.\n\n         Decimal           1   3   7  15  31  62  125  250 500\n         \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n         Binary            1   1   1   1   1   0    1    0   0\n\nObviously we can reverse this procedure to convert binary numbers to\ntheir decimal equivalents.\n\nThere is an interesting extension of this process called duplication by\nwhich multiplication can be done quite simply. Let us multiply 95 times\n36. We will halve our 95 as we did in the earlier example, while\ndoubling the 36. This time when we have an even number in the left\ncolumn, we will simply cancel out the corresponding number in the right\ncolumn.\n\n                               95        36\n                               47        72\n                               23       144\n                               11       288\n                                5       576\n                                2      ****\n                                1      2304\n                                         \u2014\u2014\n                                       3420\n\nThis clever bit of mathematics is called Russian peasant multiplication,\nalthough it was also known to early Egyptians and many others. It\npermits unschooled people, with only the ability to add and divide, to\ndo fairly complex multiplication problems. Actually it is based on our\nold stand-by, the binary system. What we have done is to represent the\n95 \u201cdyadically,\u201d or by twos, and to multiply 36 successively by each of\nthese powers as applicable. We will not digress further, but leave this\nas an example of the tricks possible with the seemingly simple binary\nsystem.\n\nEven after we have learned to convert from the decimal numbers we are\nfamiliar with into binary notation almost by inspection, the results are\nadmittedly unwieldy for human handling. An employee who is used to\ngetting $105 a week would be understandably confused if the computer\nprinted out a check for him reading $1101001. For this reason the\ncomputer programmer has reached a compromise with the machine. He speaks\ndecimal, it speaks binary; they meet each other halfway with something\ncalled binary-coded decimal. Here\u2019s the way it works.\n\nA little thought will show that the decimal numbers from 0 through 9 can\nbe presented in binary using four bits. Thus:\n\n                           _Decimal_ _Binary_\n                              0            0\n                              1            1\n                              2          110\n                              3          111\n                              4         1100\n                              5         1101\n                              6         1110\n                              7        10111\n                              8        11000\n                              9        11001\n\nIn the interest of uniformity we fill in the blanks with 0\u2019s, so that\neach decimal number is represented by a four-digit block, or word, of\nbinary code. Now when the computer programmer wants to feed the number\n560 into the computer in binary he breaks it into separate words of 5,\n6, and 0; or 0101, 0110, and 0000. In effect, we have changed $5 words\ninto four-bit words! The computer couldn\u2019t care less, since it handles\nbinary digits at the rate of millions a second; and the human is better\nable to keep his marbles while he works with the computer. Of course,\nthere are some computers that are classed as pure binary machines. These\nwork on mathematical problems, with none of the restrictions imposed by\nhuman frailty. For the computer the pure binary system is more efficient\nthan the binary decimal compromise.\n\nThe four-digit words can be made to represent not only numbers, but\nletters as well. When this is done it is called an alpha-numeric or\nalphameric code. Incidentally, it is conceivable that language could be\nmade up of only 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, or perhaps _a_\u2019s and _b_\u2019s would be better.\nAll it would take would be the stringing together of enough letters to\ncover all the words there are. The result would be rather dull, with\nwords like _aabbababaabbaaba_, _bbaabbaabababaaabab_, and\n_aaaaaaaaabaaa_; it is doubtful that the computer will make much headway\nwith a binary alphabet for its human masters.\n\nIn the early days of binary computer work, the direct conversion to\nbinary code we have discussed was satisfactory, but soon the designers\nof newer machines and calculating methods began to juggle the digits\naround for various reasons. For one thing, a decimal 0 was represented\nby four binary 0\u2019s. Electrically, this represents no signal at all in\nthe computer\u2019s inner workings. If trouble happened, say a loose\nconnection, or a power failure for a split second, the word 0000 might\nbe printed out and accepted as a valid zero when it actually meant a\nmalfunction. So the designers got busy trying other codes than the basic\nbinary.\n\nOne clever result is the \u201cexcess-3\u201d code. In this variation 3 is added\nto each decimal number before conversion. A decimal 30 is then\nrepresented by the word 0011 instead of 0000. There is, in fact, no such\ncomputer word as 0000 in excess-3 code. This eliminates the possibility\nof an error being taken for a 0. Excess-3 does something else too. If\neach digit is changed, that is, if 1\u2019s become 0\u2019s and 0\u2019s become 1\u2019s,\nthe new word is the \u201c9\u2019s complement\u201d of the original. For example, the\nbinary code for 4 in excess-3 is 0111. Changing all the digits, we get\n1000, which is decimal 5. This is not just an interesting curiosity, but\nthe 9\u2019s complement of 4 (9 minus 4). Anyone familiar with an adding\nmachine is used to performing subtraction by using complements of\nnumbers. The computer cannot do anything but add; by using the excess-3\ncode it can subtract by adding. Thus, while the computer cannot subtract\n0110 from 1000, it can quite handily add 1001 to 1000 to get the same\nresult.\n\nThere are many other reasons for codes, among them being the important\none of checking for errors. \u201cCasting out nines\u201d is a well-known\ntechnique of the bookkeeper for locating mistakes in work. Certain\nbinary codes, containing what is called a \u201cparity bit,\u201d have the\nproperty of self-checking, in a manner similar to casting out nines. A\nstory is told of some pioneer computer designers who hit on the idea of\nanother means of error checking not as effective as the code method.\n\nThe idea was clever enough, it being that identical computers would do\neach problem and compare answers, much like the pairs of abacus-wielders\nin Japan\u2019s banks. In case both computers did not come up with the same\nanswer, a correction would be made. With high hopes, the designers fed a\nproblem into the machines and sat back to watch. Soon enough a warning\nlight blinked on one machine as it caught an error. But simultaneously a\nlight blinked on the other. After that, chaos reigned until the power\nplugs were finally pulled. Although made of metal and wires, the\ncomputers demonstrated a remarkably human trait; each thought the other\nwas wrong and was doing its best to change its partner\u2019s answer! The\nsolution, of course, was to add a third computer.\n\nBinary decimal, as we have pointed out, is a wasteful code. The decimal\nnumber 100 in binary decimal coding is 0001 0000 0000, or 12 digits.\nPure binary is 1100100, or only 7 digits. By going to a binary-octal\ncode, using eight numbers instead of ten, the words can be 3-bit instead\nof 4-bit. This is called an \u201ceconomy\u201d code, and finds some application.\nThere are also \u201cGray\u201d codes, reflected binary codes, and many more, each\nserving a particular purpose. Fortunately for the designer, he can be\nprodigal with his use of codes. With 4-bit words, 29 _billion_ codes are\navailable, so a number of them are still unused.\n\nHaving translated our decimal numbers into code intelligible to our\ncomputer, we still have the mathematical operations to perform on it.\nWith a little practice we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide our\nbinary numbers quite easily, as in the examples that follow.\n\n                      Addition:       1100   (12)\n                                      0111   ( 7)\n                                        \u2014\u2014     \u2014\u2014\n                                     10011   (19)\n\n                      Subtraction:    1010   (10)\n                                    - 0010   ( 2)\n                                       \u2014\u2014\u2014     \u2014\u2014\n                                      1000    (8)\n\n\n              Multiplication:              0110        (6)\n\n                                         \u00d7 0011        (3)\n\n                                            \u2014\u2014\u2014        \u2013\u2014\u2014\n\n                                           0110\n\n                                          0110\n\n                                         0000\n\n                                        0000\n\n                                            \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n                                          10010       (18)\n\n\n              TN1 Division:    1010 \u00f7 10 = 0101  (10 \u00f7 2 =\n                                                        5)\n\nThe rules should be obvious from these examples. Just as we add 5 and 5\nto get 0 with 1 to carry, we add 1 and 1 and get 0 with 1 to carry in\nbinary. Adding 1 and 0 gives 1, 0 and 0 gives 0. Multiplying 1 times 1\ngives 1, 1 times 0 gives 0, and 0 times 0 gives 0. One divides into 1\nonce, and into 0 no times. Thus we can manipulate in just the manner we\nare accustomed to.\n\nThe computer does not even need to know this much. All it is concerned\nwith is addition: 1 plus 1 gives 0 and 1 to carry; 1 plus 0 gives 1; and\n0 plus 0 gives 0. This is all it knows, and all it needs to know. We\nhave described how it subtracts by adding complements. It can multiply\nby repetitive additions, or more simply, by shifting the binary number\nto the left. Thus, 0001 becomes 0010 in one shift, and 0100 in two\nshifts, doubling each time. This is of course just the way we do it in\nthe decimal system. Shifting to the right divides by two in the binary\nsystem.\n\nThe simplest computer circuitry performs additions in a serial manner,\nthat is, one operation at a time. This is obviously a slow way to do\nbusiness, and by adding components so that there are enough to handle\nthe digits in each row simultaneously the arithmetic operation is\ngreatly speeded. This is called parallel addition. Both operations are\ndone by parts understandably called adders, which are further broken\ndown into half-adders.\n\nThere are refinements to basic binary computation, of course. By using a\ndecimal point, or perhaps a binary point, fractions can be expressed in\nbinary code. If the position to the left of the point is taken as 2 to\nthe zero power, then the position just to the right of the point is\nlogically 2 to the minus one, which if you remember your mathematics\nyou\u2019ll recognize as one-half. Two to the minus two is then one-fourth,\nand so on. While we are on the subject of the decimal point,\nsophisticated computers do what is called \u201cfloating-point arithmetic,\u201d\nin which the point can be moved back and forth at will for much more\nrapid arithmetical operations.\n\nNo matter how many adders we put together and how big the computer\neventually gets, it is still operating in what seems an awkward fashion.\nIt is counting its fingers, of which it has two. The trick is in the\nspeed of this counting, so fast that one million additions a second is\nnow a commonplace. Try that for size in your own decimally trained head\nand you will appreciate the computer a little more.\n\n\n                         _The Logical Algebra_\n\nWe come now to another most important reason for the effectiveness of\nthe digital computer; the reason that makes it the \u201clogical\u201d choice for\nnot only mathematics but thinking as well. For the digital computer and\nlogic go hand in hand.\n\nLogic, says Webster, is \u201cthe science that deals with canons and criteria\nof validity in thought and demonstration.\u201d He admits to the ironic\nperversion of this basic definition; for example, \u201cartillery has been\ncalled the \u2018_logic_ of kings,\u2019\u201d a kind of logic to make \u201cargument\nuseless.\u201d Omar Khayy\u00e1m had a similar thought in mind when he wrote in\n_The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t_,\n\n                 The grape that can with logic absolute,\n                 The Two-and-Seventy Sects confute.\n\nOther poets and writers have had much to say on the subject of logic\nthrough the years, words of tribute and words of warning. Some, like\nLord Dunsany, counsel moderation even in our logic. \u201cLogic, like\nwhiskey,\u201d he says, \u201closes its beneficial effect when taken in too large\nquantities.\u201d And Oliver Wendell Holmes asks,\n\n              Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay\n              That was built in such a logical way\n              It ran a hundred years to the day?\n\nThe words logic and logical are much used and abused in our language,\nand there are all sorts of logic, including that of women, which seems\nto be a special case. For our purposes here it is best to stick to the\nprimary definition in the dictionary, that of validity in thought and\ndemonstration.\n\nSymbolic logic, a term that still has an esoteric and almost mystical\nconnotation, is perhaps mysterious because of the strange symbology\nused. We are used to reasoning in words and phrases, and the notion that\ntruth can be spelled out in algebraic or other notation is hard to\naccept unless we are mathematicians to begin with.\n\nWe must go far back in history for the beginnings of logic. Aristotelian\nlogic is well known and of importance even though the old syllogisms\nhave been found not as powerful as their inventors thought. Modern\nlogicians have reduced the 256 possible permutations to a valid 15 and\nthese are not as useful as the newer kind of logic that has since come\ninto being.\n\nLeibniz is conceded to be the father of modern symbolic logic, though he\nprobably neither recognized what he had done nor used it effectively. He\ndid come up with the idea of two-valued logic, and the cosmological\nnotion of 1 and 0, or substance and nothingness. In his _Characteristica\nUniversalis_ he was groping for a universal language for science; a\nsecond work, _Calculus Ratiocinator_, was an attempt to implement this\nlanguage. Incidentally, Leibnitz was not yet twenty years old when he\nformulated his logic system.\n\nUnfortunately it was two centuries later before the importance of his\nfindings was recognized and an explanation of their potential begun. In\nEngland, Sir William Hamilton began to refine the old syllogisms, and is\nknown for his \u201cquantification of the predicate.\u201d Augustus De Morgan,\nalso an Englishman, moved from the quantification of the predicate to\nthe formation of thirty-two rules or propositions that result. The stage\nwas set now for the man who has come to be known as the father of\nsymbolic logic. His name was George Boole, inventor of Boolean algebra.\n\nIn 1854, Boole published \u201cAn Investigation of the Laws of Thought on\nwhich are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities.\u201d\nIn an earlier pamphlet, Boole had said, \u201cThe few who think that there is\nthat in analysis which renders it deserving of attention for its own\nsake, may find it worth while to study it under a form in which every\nequation can be solved and every solution interpreted.\u201d He was a mild,\nquiet man, though nonconformist religiously and socially, and his\n\u201cInvestigation\u201d might as well have been dropped down a well for all the\nimmediate splash it made in the scientific world. It was considered only\nacademically interesting, and copies of it gathered dust for more than\nfifty years.\n\nOnly in 1910 was the true importance given to Boole\u2019s logical calculus,\nor \u201calgebra\u201d as it came to be known. Then Alfred North Whitehead and\nBertrand Russell made the belated acknowledgment in their _Principia\nMathematica_, and Russell has said, \u201cPure mathematics was discovered by\nBoole, in a work he called \u2018The Laws of Thought.\u2019\u201d While his praise is\nundoubtedly exaggerated, it is interesting to note the way in which\nmathematics and thought are considered inseparable. In 1928, the first\ntext on the new algebra was published. The work of Hilbert and\nAckermann, _Mathematical Logic_, was printed first in German and then in\nEnglish.\n\nWhat was the nature of this new tool for better thinking that Boole had\ncreated? Its purpose was to make possible not merely precise, but\n_exact_ analytical thought. Historically we think in words, and these\nwords have become fraught with semantic ditches, walls, and traps. Boole\nwas thinking of thought and not mathematics or science principally when\nhe developed his logic algebra, and it is indicative that symbolic logic\ntoday is often taught by the philosophy department in the university.\n\nRussell had hinted at the direction in which symbolic logic would go,\nand it was not long before the scientist as well as the mathematician\nand logician did begin to make use of the new tool. One pioneer was\nShannon, mentioned in the chapter on history. In 1938, Claude Shannon\nwas a student at M.I.T. He would later make scientific history with his\ntreatise on and establishment of a new field called information theory;\nhis early work was titled \u201cA Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching\nCircuits.\u201d In it he showed that electrical and electronic circuitry\ncould best be described by means of Boolean logic. Shannon\u2019s work led to\ngreat strides in improving telephone switching circuits and it also was\nof much importance to the designer of digital computers. To see why this\nis so, we must now look into Boolean algebra itself. As we might guess,\nit is based on a two-valued logic, a true-false system that exactly\nparallels the on-off computer switches we are familiar with.\n\nThe Biblical promise \u201cYe shall know the truth, and the truth shall make\nyou free\u201d applies to our present situation. The best way to get our feet\nwet in the Boolean stream is to learn its so-called \u201ctruth tables.\u201d\n\n                    _Conjunctive Boolean Operation_\n\n                    A _and_ B equal C      A B C\n                       (A \u00b7 B = C)          \u2014\u2014\u2014\n                                           0 0 0\n                                           1 0 0\n                                           0 1 0\n                                           1 1 1\n\n\n                    _Disjunctive Boolean Operation_\n\n                    A _or_ B equals C      A B C\n                       (\u0100 \u2228 B = C)          \u2014\u2014\u2014\n                                           0 0 0\n                                           1 0 1\n                                           0 1 1\n                                           1 1 1\n\nIn the truth tables, 1 symbolizes true, 0 is false. In the conjunctive\nAND operation, we see that only if both A and B are true is C true. In\nthe disjunctive OR operation, if _either_ A _or_ B is true, then C is\nalso true. From this seemingly na\u00efve and obvious base, the entire\nBoolean system is built, and digital computers can perform not only\ncomplex mathematical operations, but logical ones as well, including the\nmaking of decisions on a purely logical basis.\n\nBefore going on to the few additional conditions and combinations that\ncomplete the algebra, let\u2019s study some analogies that will make clear\nthe AND/OR principles of operation. We can think of AND as two bridges\nin sequence over two rivers. We can reach our destination only if both\nbridges are working. However, suppose there are two parallel bridges and\nonly one river. We can then cross if either or both of the bridges is\nworking. A closer example is that of electrical switches. Current will\nflow through our AND circuit if\u2014and only if\u2014both switches are closed.\nWhen the switches are in parallel\u2014an OR circuit\u2014current will flow if\neither, or both, are closed.\n\nThe truth tables resemble the bridge or switch arrangements. We can\nproceed across the line of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s in the first table only if both\nswitches are closed. The symbol 1 means that the switch is closed, so we\ncan cross only the bottom line. In the second table, we are told we can\nproceed across the line if either switch is closed. Thus we can cross\nlines 2, 3, and 4. We can use many symbols in our two-valued system.\n\n                                _Symbol_\n\n                            Bridge     No\n                                     Bridge\n\n                            Power   No Power\n\n                              1        0\n\n                             True    False\n\nA little imagination suggests a logic computer of sorts with one switch,\na battery, and a light bulb. Suppose we turn on the switch when we drive\ninto our garage. A light in the hallway then indicates that the car is\navailable. By using two switches we can indicate that a second car is\nalso in the garage; or that either of them is, simply by choosing\nbetween AND logic and OR logic. Childish as this seems, it is the\nprinciple of even our most complex thinking processes. You will remember\nthat the brain is considered a digital computer, since neurons can only\nbe on or off. All it takes is 10 billion neuron switches!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Remington Rand UNIVAC_\n\n  AND and OR gates in series. Switches 1 _and_ 2, plus 3 _or_ 4, are\n    needed to light the bulb.\n]\n\nIn addition to the conjunctives AND and OR, Boolean algebra makes use of\nthe principle of negation. This is graphically illustrated thus:\n\n                         _Original_ _Negation_\n                             A          \u0100\n                             1          0\n                             0          1\n\nThe negation device used in computer circuitry is called an inverter,\nsince it changes its input from a 1 to a 0, or vice versa. The\nusefulness of such an element is obvious when we remember the computer\ntrick of subtracting by adding complements. The inverter circuit used\nwith a code like the excess-3 readily forms these complements.\n\nFurther sophistication of the basic Boolean forms leads to units other\nthan the AND and OR gates. Possible are NOT, NOR, and exclusive-OR\nforms. In the latter, there is an output if one and only one input is\npresent. The NOR circuit is interesting in that it was made possible\nwith the introduction of the transistor; the vacuum tube does not permit\nthis configuration.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Computer Control Co._\n\n  The functions of two binary variables.\n]\n\nPresent-day symbolic logic is not the pure Boolean as presented back in\n1854. Boole\u2019s OR was the exclusive, one and only one, type. Today the\nlogician generally assumes the either-or connotation. The logic has also\nbeen amplified, using the commutative, associative, and distributive\nlaws much like those of conventional algebra. We are indebted to De\nMorgan for most of this work, showing that A and B equals B and A; A and\n(A and B) equals (A and B) and A; and so on. While these seem\nintuitively true, the implications are nonetheless of great importance\nboth in pure logic and its practical use in circuitry.\n\nA graphic representation of the metamorphosis from symbolic to actual\nimplementation of Boolean equations follows: The implication of\nimportance is that logic applies equally well whether we are making a\nqualifying statement such as \u201cA man must have strength _and_ courage to\nwin a barehanded fight with a lion,\u201d or wiring a defensive missile so\nthat it will fire only if a target is within range _and_ is unfriendly.\n\nIn the early period of computer design the engineer was faced with the\nproblem of building his own switches and gates. Today many companies\noffer complete \u201cpackaged\u201d components\u2014AND gates, OR gates, and the other\nconfigurations. This is the modular approach to building a computer and\nthe advantages are obvious. The designer can treat the components simply\nas \u201cblack boxes\u201d that will respond in a prescribed way to certain input\nconditions. If he wants, the engineer can go a step further and buy a\nready-built logic panel consisting of many components of different\ntypes. All he need do to form various logic circuits is to interconnect\nthe proper components with plug-in leads. This brings us to the point of\nlearning what we can do with these clever gates and switches now that we\nhave them available and know something about the way they work.\n\nWe talked about the computer adder circuit earlier in this chapter. It\nis made up of two half-adders, remember, with perhaps an additional OR\ngate, flip-flop, etc. Each half-adder is composed of two AND gates and\nan OR gate. So we have put together several basically simple parts and\nthe result is a piece of equipment that will perform addition at a rate\nto make our heads swim.\n\nThere are other things we can do with Boolean logic besides arithmetic.\nA few gates will actuate a warning signal in a factory in case either of\ntwo ventilators is closed and the temperature goes up beyond a safe\npoint; or in case both vents are closed at the same time. We can build a\nlogic computer that will tell us when three of four assembly lines are\nshut down at the same time, and also which three they are.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _General Electric Co., Computer Dept._\n\n  Electronic computers are built up of many \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d like this\n    one.\n]\n\nLogic problems abound in puzzle books, and many of us spend sleepless\nnights trying to solve them in our heads. An example is the \u201cFarnsworth\nCar Pool\u201d problem. Rita Farnsworth asks her husband if someone in his\ncar pool can drive for him tomorrow so that she may use the car. Joe\nFarnsworth replies, \u201cWell, when I asked Pete if he would take my turn he\nsaid he was flying to Kansas City today, but he\u2019d be glad to drive\ntomorrow if he didn\u2019t have to stay over and that his wife has been\nstaying home lately and he will drive her car if she doesn\u2019t go to work.\nOscar said that since his own car is due back from the garage tomorrow\nhe can drive it even if his wife does use hers, provided the garage gets\nhis back to him. But if this cold of mine gets any worse I\u2019m going to\nstay home even if those fellows have to walk to work, so you can\ncertainly have the car if I don\u2019t go to work.\u201d This dialogue of Joe\u2019s\nconfuses Rita and most of us are in the same state.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Autonetics Division, North American Aviation, Inc._\n\n  Testing an assembled digital computer.\n]\n\nThe instruction manual for BRAINIAC, a do-it-yourself computer that\nsells for a few dollars, gives a simple wiring diagram for solving\nRita\u2019s dilemma. Electrically the problem breaks down into three OR gates\nand one AND gate. All Mrs. Farnsworth has to do is set in the conditions\nand watch the indicator light. If it glows, she gets the car!\n\nThese are of course simple tasks and it might pay to hire a man to\noperate the vents, and ride to work on the bus when the car pool got\ncomplicated. But even with relatively few variables, decision-making can\nquickly become a task requiring a digital computer operating with\nBoolean logic principles.\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Science Materials Center_\n\n  Problem in logic reduced to electrical circuits.\n]\n\nThe Smith-Jones-Robinson type of problem in which we must find who does\nwhat and lives where is tougher than the car pool\u2014tough enough that it\nis sometimes used in aptitude tests. Lewis Carroll carried this form of\nlogical puzzler to complicated extremes involving not just three\nvariables but a dozen. To show how difficult such a problem is, an IBM\n704 required four minutes to solve a Carroll puzzle as to whether any\nmagistrates indulge in snuff-taking. The computer did it the easy way,\nwithout printing out a complete \u201ctruth table\u201d for the problem\u2014the method\na man would have to use to investigate all the combinations of\nvariables. This job would have taken 13 hours! While the question of the\nuse of snuff is perhaps important only to tobacconists and\npuzzle-makers, our technical world today does encounter similar problems\nwhich are not practical of solution without a high-speed computer. A\nrecent hypothetical case discussed in an electronics journal illustrates\nthis well.\n\nA missile system engineer has the problem of modifying a Nike-Ajax\nlaunching site so that it can be used by the new Nike-Hercules missile.\nHe must put in switching equipment so that a remote control center can\nchoose either an Ajax system, or one of six Hercules systems. To\ncomplicate things, the newer Hercules can be equipped with any of three\ndifferent warheads and fly either of two different missions. When\nsomeone at the control center pushes a button, the computer must know\nimmediately which if any of the missiles are in acceptable condition to\nbe fired.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t sound like too big a problem. However, since there are\ntwelve on-off signals to be considered, and since each has two possible\nstates, there are 4,096 possible missile combinations. Not all these are\nprobable, of course, but there is still sufficient variation to make it\nhumanly impossible to check all of them and close a firing switch in the\nsplit second the control center can allow.\n\nThe answer lies in putting Boolean algebra on the job, with a system of\ngates and inverters capable of juggling the multiplicity of\ncombinations. Then when the word comes requesting a missile launch, the\ncomputer handles the job in microseconds without straining itself\nunduly.\n\nJust as Shannon pointed out twenty-five years ago, switching philosophy\ncan be explained best by Boolean logic, and the method can be used not\nonly to implement a particular circuit, but also to actually design the\ncircuit in the first place. A simple example of this can be shown with\nthe easy-to-understand AND and OR gates. A technician experimenting with\nan AND gate finds that if he simply reverses the direction of current,\nhe changes the gate into an OR gate. This might come as a surprise to\nhim if he is unfamiliar with Boolean logic, but a logician with no\nunderstanding of electrical circuits could predict the result simply by\nstudying the truth tables for AND and OR.\n\nReversing the polarity is equivalent to changing a 1 to a 0 and vice\nversa. If we do this in the AND gate table, we should not be surprised\nto find that the result looks exactly like the OR table! It acts like it\ntoo, as the technician found out.\n\nBoolean logic techniques can be applied to existing circuits to improve\nand/or simplify them. Problems as simple as wiring a light so that it\ncan be turned on and off from two or more locations, and those as\ncomplex as automating a factory, yield readily to the simple rules\nGeorge Boole laid down more than a hundred years ago.\n\nWatching a high-speed electronic digital computer solve mathematical\nproblems, or operate an industrial control system with speed and\naccuracy impossible for human monitors, it is difficult to believe that\nthe whole thing hinges on something as simple as switches that must be\neither open or closed. If Leibnitz were alive, he could well take this\nas proof of his contention that there was cosmological significance in\nthe concept of 1 and 0. Maybe there is, after all!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Industrial Electronic Engineering & Maintenance_\n\n  \u201cLuckily I brought along a \u2018loaner\u2019 for you to use while I repair your\n    computer.\u201d\n]\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    \u201c_Whatever that be which thinks, understands, wills, and\n    acts, it is something celestial and divine._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014Cicero\n\n\n\n\n                        6: The Electronic Brain\n\n\nThe idea of a man-made \u201cbrain\u201d is far from being new. Back in 1851, Dr.\nAlfred Smee of England proposed a machine made up of logic circuits and\nmemory devices which would be able to answer any questions it was asked.\nDoctor Smee was a surgeon, keenly interested in the processes of the\nmind. Another Britisher, H. G. Wells, wrote a book called _Giant Brain_\nin 1938 which proposed much the same thing: a machine with all knowledge\npumped into it, and capable of feeding back answers to all problems.\n\nIf it was logical to credit \u201chuman\u201d characteristics to the machines man\ncontrived, the next step then was to endow the machine with the worst of\nthese attributes. In works including Butler\u2019s _Erewhon_, the diabolical\naspects of an intelligent machine are discussed. The Lionel Britton\nplay, _Brain_, produced in 1930, shows the machine gradually becoming\nthe master of the race. A more physical danger from the artificial brain\nis the natural result of giving it a body as well. We have already\nmentioned \u010capek\u2019s _R.U.R._ and the Ambrose Bierce story about a\nchess-playing robot without a built-in sense of humor, who strangles the\nhuman being who beats him at a game. With these stories as models, other\nwriters have turned out huge quantities of work involving mechanical\nbrains capable of all sorts of mischief. Most of these authors were not\nas well-grounded scientifically as the pioneering Dr. Smee who admitted\nsadly that his \u201cbrain\u201d would indeed be a giant, covering an area about\nthe size of London!\n\nThe idea of the giant brain was given new lease by the early electronic\ncomputers that began appearing in the 1940\u2019s. These vacuum-tube and\nmechanical-relay machines with their rows of cabinets and countless\nwinking lights were seized on gleefully by contemporary writers, and the\n\u201cbrain\u201d stories multiplied gaudily.\n\nMany of the acts of these fictional machines were monstrous, and most of\nthe stories were calculated to make scientists ill. Many of these\ngentlemen said the only correct part of the name \u201cgiant brain\u201d was the\nadjective; that actually the machine was an _idiot savant_, a sort of\nhigh-speed moron. This opinion notwithstanding, the name stuck. One\nscholar says that while it is regrettable that such a vulgar term has\nbecome so popular, it is hardly worth while campaigning against its use.\n\nAn amusing contemporary fiction story describes an angry crowd storming\na laboratory housing a \u201cgiant brain,\u201d only to be placated by a calm,\nsensibly arguing scientist. The mob dispersed, he goes back inside and\nreports his success to the machine. The \u201cbrain\u201d is pleased, and issues\nhim his next order.\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d scoff most computer people. A recent text on operation of\nthe digital computer says, \u201cWhere performance comparable with that of\nthe human brain is concerned, man need have little fear that he will\never be replaced by this machine. It cannot think in any way comparable\nto a human being.\u201d Note the cautious use of \u201clittle,\u201d however.\n\nAnother authority admits that the logic machines of the monk Ram\u00f3n Lull\nwere very clever in their proof of God\u2019s existence, but points out that\nthe monk who invented them was far cleverer since no computer has ever\ninvented a monk who could prove anything at all!\n\nThe first wave of ridiculous predictions has run its course and been\nfollowed by loud refutations. Now there is a third period of calmer and\nmore sensible approach. A growing proportion of scientists take a\nmiddle-of-the-stream attitude, weighing both sides of the case for the\ncomputer, yet some read like science fiction.\n\nCyberneticist Norbert Wiener, more scientist than fictioneer, professes\nto foresee computerized robots taking over from their masters, much as a\nGreek slave once did. Mathematician John Williams of the Rand\nCorporation thinks that computers can, and possibly will, become more\nintelligent than men.\n\nEqually reputable scientists take the opposite view. Neuro-physiologist\nGerhard Werner of Cornell Medical College doubts that computers can ever\nmatch the creativity of man. He seems to share the majority view today,\nthough many who agree will add, tongue in cheek, that perhaps we\u2019d\n_better_ keep one hand on the wall plug just in case.\n\n\n                           _Thinking Defined_\n\nThe first step in deciding whether or not the computer thinks is to\ndefine thinking. Far from being a simple task, this definition turns out\nto be a slippery thing. In fact, if the computer has done no more than\ndemand this sort of reappraisal of the human brain\u2019s working, it has\njustified its existence. Webster lists meanings for \u201cthink\u201d under two\nheadings, for the transitive and intransitive forms of the verb. These\nmeanings, respectively, start out with \u201cTo form in the mind,\u201d and \u201cTo\nexercise the powers of judgment ... to reflect for the purpose of\nreaching a conclusion.\u201d\n\nEven a fairly simple computer would seem to qualify as a thinker by\nthese yardsticks. The storing of data in a computer memory may be\nanalogous to forming in the mind, and manipulating numbers to find a\nsquare root certainly calls for some sort of judgment. Learning is a\npart of thinking, and computers are proving that they _can_ learn\u2014or at\nleast be taught. Recall of this learning from the memory to solve\nproblems is also a part of the thinking process, and again the computer\ndemonstrates this capability.\n\nOne early psychological approach to the man-versus-machine debate was\nthat of classifying living and nonliving things. In _Outline of\nPsychology_, the Englishman William McDougall lists seven attributes of\nlife. Six of these describe \u201cgoal-seeking\u201d qualities; the seventh refers\nto the ability to learn. In general, psychologist McDougall felt that\npurposive behavior was the key to the living organism. Thus any computer\nthat is purposive\u2014and any commercial model had better be!\u2014is alive, in\nMcDougall\u2019s view. A restating of the division between man and machine is\nobviously in order.\n\nDr. W. Ross Ashby, a British scientist now working at the University of\nIllinois, defines intelligence as \u201cappropriate selection\u201d and\ngoal-seeking as the intelligent process _par excellence_, whether the\nselecting is done by a human being or by a machine. Ashby does split off\nthe \u201cnon goal-seeking\u201d processes occurring in the human brain as a\ndistinct class: \u201cnatural\u201d processes neither good nor bad in themselves\nand resulting from man\u2019s environment and his evolution.\n\nIntelligence, to Ashby, who long ago demonstrated a mechanical\n\u201chomeostat\u201d which showed purposive behavior, is the utilization of\ninformation by highly efficient processing to achieve a high intensity\nof appropriate selection. Intelligent is as intelligent does, no\ndistinction being made as to man or machine. _Humanoid_ and _artificial_\nwould thus be meaningless words for describing a computer. Ashby makes\nanother important point in that the intelligence of a brain or a machine\ncannot exceed what has been put into it, unless we admit the workings of\nmagic. Ashby\u2019s beliefs are echoed in a way by scientist Oliver Selfridge\nof Lincoln Laboratory. Asked if a machine can think, Selfridge says,\n\u201cCertainly; although the machine\u2019s intelligence has an elusive,\n_unnatural_ quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink, Hell, COMPUTE!\u201d reads the sign on the wall of a computer\nlaboratory. But much of our thinking, perhaps some of the \u201cnatural\u201d\nprocesses of our brains, doesn\u2019t seem to fit into computational\npatterns. That part of our thinking, the part that includes looking at\npretty girls, for example, will probably remain peculiar to the human\nbrain.\n\n\n                           _The Human Brain_\n\nMundy Peale, president of Republic Aviation Corporation, addressing a\ncommittee studying the future of manned aircraft, had this to say:\n\nUntil someone builds, for $100 or less with unskilled labor, a computer\nno larger than a grapefruit, requiring only a tenth of a volt of\nelectricity, yet capable of digesting and transmitting incoming data in\na fraction of a second and storing 10,000 times as much data as today\u2019s\nlargest computers, the pilots of today have nothing to worry about.\n\nThe human brain is obviously a thing of amazing complexity and fantastic\nability. Packed into the volume Mr. Peale described are some 10\n_billion_ neurons, the nerve cells that seem to be the key to the\noperation of our minds. Hooked up like some ultra-complicated\nswitchboard, the network of interconnections stores an estimated\n200,000,000,000,000,000,000 bits of information during a lifetime! By\ncomparison, today\u2019s most advanced computers do seem pathetically\nunimpressive.\n\nWe have discussed both analog and digital computers in preceding\nchapters. It is interesting to find that the human brain is basically a\ndigital type, though it does have analog overtones as well. Each of the\nneurons is actually a switch operated by an electric current on a\ngo/no-go, all-or-nothing basis. Thus a neuron is not partly on or partly\noff. If the electrical impulse exceeds a certain \u201cthreshold\u201d value, the\nswitch operates.\n\nTied to the neurons are axons, the long \u201cwires\u201d that carry the input and\noutput. The axons bring messages from the body\u2019s sensors to the neurons,\nand the output to other neurons or to the muscles and other control\nfunctions. This grapefruit-size collection of electrochemical components\nthus stores our memories and effects the operation we call thinking.\n\nSince brain impulses are electrical in nature, we speak of them in\nelectrical terms. The impulses have an associated potential of 50\nmillivolts, that is, fifty thousandths of a volt. The entire brain\ndissipates about 10 watts, so that each individual neuron requires only\na billionth of a watt of power. This amount is far less than that of\nanalogous computer parts.\n\nA neuron may take a ten-thousandth of a second to respond to a stimulus.\nThis seemingly rapid operation time turns out to be far slower than\npresent-day computer switches, but the brain makes up for this by being\na \u201cparallel operation\u201d system. This means that many different\nconnections are being made simultaneously in different branches, rather\nthan being sequential, or a series of separate actions.\n\nPackaging 10 billion parts in a volume the size of a grapefruit is a\ncapability the computer designer admires wistfully. Since the brain has\na volume of about 1,000 cubic centimeters, 10 million neurons fit into a\nspace of one cubic centimeter! A trillion would fit in one cubic foot,\nand man-made machines with even a million components per cubic foot are\nnews today.\n\nEven when we are resting, with our eyes closed, a kind of stand-by\ncurrent known as the alpha rhythm is measurable in our brains. This\ncurrent, which has a frequency of about 10 cycles per second, changes\nwhen we see or feel something, or when we exercise the power of recall.\nIt disappears when we sleep soundly, and is analogous to the operating\ncurrent in a computer. Also, there is \u201cpower\u201d available locally at the\nneurons to \u201camplify\u201d weak signals sufficiently to trigger off following\nbranches of neurons.\n\nPhilosophers have proposed two general concepts of the human brain and\nhow it functions. The _a priori_ theory presupposes a certain amount of\n\u201cwired-in\u201d knowledge: instincts, ideals, and so on. The other theory,\nthat of the _tabula rasa_ or clean slate new brain, argues that each of\nus organizes an essentially random net of nerves into ordered\nintelligence. Both theories are being investigated with computers, and\nas a result light is beginning to be shed on the workings of our brains.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _The Upjohn Company, Ezra Stoller Associates Photo_\n\n  \u201cA moment at a concert\u201d is diagrammed by brain model, showing eyes,\n    ears, nerves, and structures analogous to brain. Picture at top\n    represents perception.\n]\n\nThere is another division of philosophical thought in the mechanistic\nversus _elan vital_ argument. In other words, is the entire mind to be\nfound in its constituent parts, or is there an intangible extra\nsomething that really breathes life into us? Whatever the correct\nconcept, the brain does record impressions it can later recall. No one\nyet knows just how this is done, but several theories have been\nadvanced. One of these describes a \u201cchain circuit\u201d set up in a neuron\nnetwork by messages from the body\u2019s sensors. This circuit, once started,\ncontinues to circle through the brain and is on tap whenever that\nparticular experience needs to be recalled. The term \u201creverberate\u201d is\nused in connection with this kind of memory, seeming to be a good\nscientific basis for the poetic \u201cechoes of the past.\u201d Reverberation\ncircuits also provide the memory for some computers.\n\nAmong other explanations of memory is that of conditioning the neurons\nto operate more \u201ceasily,\u201d so that certain paths are readily traversed by\nbrain impulses. This could be effected by chemical changes locally, and\nsuch a technique too is used in computers.\n\nHowever the brain accomplishes its job, it is certain that it evolved in\nits present form as a result of the environment its cells have had to\nfunction in for billions of years. Its prime purpose has been one of\nsurvival, and for this reason some argue that it is not particularly\nwell adapted to abstract reasoning. Although the brain can do a wide\nvariety of things from dreaming to picking out one single voice amid the\nhubbub of noise at a social gathering\u2014a phenomenon scientists have given\nthe descriptive name of \u201ccocktail party effect\u201d\u2014men like Ashby consider\nit a very inflexible piece of equipment not well suited to pure logic.\nAs a test of your brain as a logical device, consider the following\nproblem from the Litton Industries \u201cProblematical Recreations.\u201d\n\nIf Sara shouldn\u2019t, then Wanda would. It is impossible that the\nstatements: \u201cSara should\u201d and \u201cCamille couldn\u2019t\u201d can both be true at the\nsame time. If Wanda could, then Sara should and Camille could. Therefore\nCamille could. Is this conclusion valid?\n\nIf your head starts to swim, you are not alone. Very few humans solve\nsuch problems easily. Interestingly, those who do, make good computer\nprogrammers.\n\n\n                         _The Computer\u2019s Brain_\n\nJust as we have an anthropomorphic God, many people have done their best\nto endow the computer with human characteristics. Not only in fiction\nbut also in real life, the electronic brains have been described as\nneurotic and frustrated on occasion, and also as being afraid and even\nhaving morning sickness! A salesman for a line of computers was asked to\nexplain in understandable terms the difference between two computers\nwhose specifications confused a customer. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way,\u201d the\nsalesman said, \u201cThe 740 thinks the 690 is a moron!\u201d\n\nWe can begin to investigate the question of computer intelligence by\nagain looking up a definition. The word \u201ccompute\u201d means literally to\nthink, or reckon, with. Early computers such as counting sticks, the\nabacus, and the adding machine are obviously something man thinks with.\nEven though we may know the multiplication tables, we find it easier and\n_safer_ to use a mechanical device to remember and even to perform\noperations for us.\n\nThese homely devices do not possess sufficient \u201cintelligence\u201d to raise\nany fears in our minds. The abacus, for example, displays only what we\nmight charitably call the property of memory. It has a certain number of\nrows, each row with a fixed number of beads. While it is not fallible,\nas is the human who uses it, it is far more limited in scope. All it can\never do is help us to add or subtract, and if we are clever, to\nmultiply, divide, do square roots, and so on. If we are looking for\npurposive behavior in computing machines, it is only when we get to the\nadding machine that a glimmer appears. When a problem is set in and the\nproper button pushed, this device is compelled to go through the\ngear-whirring or whatever required to return it to a state of\nequilibrium with its problem solved.\n\nSo far we might facetiously describe the difference in the goal-seeking\ncharacteristics of man and machine by recalling that man seeks lofty\ngoals like climbing mountains simply because they are there, while the\ncomputer seeks its goal much like the steel ball in the pinball machine,\nimpelled by gravity and the built-in springs and chutes of the device.\nWhen we come to a more advanced computer, however, we begin to have\ndifficulty in assessing characteristics. For the JOHNNIAC, built by Rand\nand named for John von Neumann, can prove the propositions in the\n_Principia Mathematica_ of Whitehead and Russell. It can also \u201clearn\u201d to\nplay a mediocre game of chess.\n\nIf we investigate the workings of a digital computer, we find much to\nremind us of the human brain. First is the obvious similarity of on-off,\nyes-no operation. This implies a power source, usually electrical, and a\nnumber of two-position switches. The over-all configuration of the\nclassic computer resembles, in principal if not physical appearance,\nthat of the human brain and its accessories.\n\nAs we have learned, the electronic computer has an input section, a\ncontrol, an arithmetic (or logic) section, a memory, and an output.\nLooking into the arithmetic and memory sections, we find a number of\ncomparisons with the brain. The computer uses power, far more than the\nbrain. A single transistor, which forms only part of a neuron, may use a\ntenth of a watt; the brain is ahead on this score by a factor of\nmillions to one.\n\nElectronic switches have an advantage over the neuron in that they are\nmuch faster acting. So fast have they become that engineers have had to\ncoin new terms like nanosecond and picosecond, for a billionth and a\ntrillionth of a second. Thus, the computer\u2019s individual elements are\nperhaps 100,000 times faster than those of the brain.\n\nThere is no computer in existence with the equivalent of 10 billion\nneurons. One ambitious _system_ of computers does use half a million\ntransistors, plus many other parts, but even these relatively few would\nnot fit under a size 7-1/2 hat. One advanced technique, using a \u201c2-D\u201d\nmetal film circuitry immersed in liquid helium for supercooling,\nhopefully will yield a packaging density of about 3-1/2 million parts\nper cubic foot in comparison with the brain\u2019s trillion-part density.\n\nWe have mentioned the computer memory that included the \u201cdelay line,\u201d\nremindful of the \u201cchain circuit\u201d in the brain. Electrical impulses were\nconverted to acoustic signals in mercury, traversed the mercury, and\nwere reconverted to electrical impulses. Early memory storage systems\nwere \u201cserial\u201d in nature, like those stored on a tape reel. To find one\nbit of information required searching the whole reel. Now random-access\nmethods are being used with memory core storage systems so wired that\nany one bit of information can be reached in about the same amount of\ntime. This magnetic core memory stores information as a magnetic field,\nagain analogous to a memory theory for the human brain except that the\nneuron is thought to undergo a chemical rather than magnetic change.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _General Electric Co., Computer Dept._\n\n  Tiny ferrite cores like these make up the memory of some computers.\n    Each core stores one \u201cbit\u201d of information.\n]\n\nUntil recently, computers have been primarily sequential, or serially\noperating, machines. As pointed out earlier, the brain operates in\nparallel and makes up for its slower operating individual parts in this\nway. Designers are now working on parallel operation for computers, an\nimprovement that may be even more important than random-access memory.\n\n\n                               _Bionics_\n\nIt is obvious that while there are many differences in the brain and the\ncomputer there are also many striking similarities. These similarities\nhave given rise to the computer-age science of \u201cbionics.\u201d A coinage of\nMajor J. E. Steele of the Air Force\u2019s Wright Air Development Center,\n_bionics_ means applying knowledge of biology and biological techniques\nto the design of electronic devices and systems. The Air Force and other\ngroups are conducting broad research programs in this field.\n\nAs an indication of the scope of bionics, Dr. Steele himself is a flight\nsurgeon, primarily trained as neurologist and psychiatrist, with\ngraduate work in electronics and mathematics. Those engaged in bionics\nresearch include mathematicians, physical scientists, embryologists,\nphilosophers, neurophysiologists, psychologists, plus scientists and\nengineers in the more generally thought of computer fields of\nelectronics and other engineering disciplines.\n\nA recent report from M.I.T. is indicative of the type of work being\ndone: \u201cWhat the Frog\u2019s Eyes Tell the Frog.\u201d A more ambitious project is\none called simply \u201cHand,\u201d which is just that. Developed by Dr. Heinrich\nErnst, \u201cHand\u201d is a computer-controlled mechanical hand that is described\nas the first artificial device to possess a limited understanding of the\noutside world. Although it will undoubtedly have industrial and other\napplications, \u201cHand\u201d was developed primarily as a study of the cognitive\nprocesses of man and animals.\n\nBesides the Air Force\u2019s formal bionics program, there are other research\nprojects of somewhat similar nature. At Harvard, psychologists Bruner\nand Miller direct a Center for Cognitive Studies, and among the\nscientists who will contribute are computer experts. Oddly, man knows\nlittle of his own cognitive or learning process despite the centuries of\nstudy of the human mind. It has been said that we know more about\nPavlov\u2019s dog and Skinner\u2019s pigeons than we do about ourselves, but now\nwe are trying to find out. Some find it logical that man study the\nanimals or computer rather than his own mind, incidentally, since they\ndoubt that an intelligence can understand itself anyway.\n\nAs an example of the importance placed on this new discipline, the\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles recently originated a course in\nits medical school entitled \u201cIntroduction to the Function and Structure\nof the Nervous System,\u201d designed to help bridge the gap between\nengineering and biology. In Russia, M. Livanov of the Soviet Academy\nResearch Institute of Physiology in Higher Nervous Activity has used a\ncomputer coupled with an electric encephaloscope in an effort to\nestablish the pattern of cortical connections in the brain.\n\nWhile many experts argue that we should not necessarily copy the brain\nin designing computers, since the brain is admittedly a survival device\nand somewhat inflexible as a result of its conditioning, it looks\nalready as if much benefit has come from the bionics approach.\n\nThe circuitry of early computers comprised what is called \u201csoldered\u201d\nlearning. This means that the connections from certain components hook\nup to certain other components, so that when switches operated in a\ngiven order, built-in results followed. One early teaching device,\ncalled the Electric Questionnaire, illustrates this built-in knowledge.\nA card of questions and answers is slipped over pegs that are actually\nterminals of interconnected wires. Probes hooked to a battery are\ntouched to a question and the supposed correct answer. If the circuit is\ncompleted, a light glows; otherwise the learner tries other answers\nuntil successful.\n\nMore sophisticated systems are those of \u201cforced\u201d learning and free\nassociation. Pioneer attempts at teaching a computer to \u201cperceive\u201d were\nconducted at Cornell University under contract with the Air Force to\ninvestigate a random-network theory of learning formulated by Dr. Frank\nRosenblatt. Specifically, the Perceptron learns to recognize letters\nplaced in front of its \u201ceyes,\u201d an array of 400 photocells. The human\nbrain accomplishes perception in several steps, though at a high enough\nrate of operation to be thought of as a continuous, almost\ninstantaneous, act. Stimuli are received by sense organs; impulses\ntravel to neurons and form interconnections resulting in judgment,\naction if necessary, and memory. The Perceptron machine functions in\nmuch the same manner.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Electronics_\n\n  Simplified version of a mammalian visual system (A) and Perceptron\n    simulating the biological network (B).\n]\n\nThe forced learning technique, in which Perceptron was told when it\ncorrectly identified a letter, and when it missed, was used first. Later\nit was found that \u201ccorrective\u201d or reinforced teaching, which notes only\nerrors, was more effective. After Perceptron had seen each letter\nfifteen times and received proper correction, it could subsequently\nidentify all the letters correctly.\n\nAnnouncement of Perceptron triggered many wild headlines and a general\nmisconception in the public mind. Dr. Rosenblatt and other developers\nwisely refuse to comment on the potential of his machine, but the number\nof experiments being conducted indicates wide scientific interest, and\n_perceptron_ has attained the prestige of an uncapitalized generic term.\nHowever, the theory of its random process has been questioned by\nscientists including Theodore Kalin, one of the builders of an early\nelectrical logic machine. Kalin feels that intelligence presupposes a\ncertain minimum of _a priori_ knowledge: the wired-in learning of the\ncomputer or the instincts or inherited qualities of animals. This of\ncourse echoes the thoughts of Kant who deplored the notion as similar to\nall the books and papers in a library somehow arranging themselves\nproperly on the shelves and in filing cabinets.\n\nIndeed, the whole idea of finding human intelligence mirrored in the\nelectronic innards of the computer has been flatly denounced at some\nscientific symposiums. Computers given an intelligence test at the\nUniversity of Michigan \u201cflunked,\u201d according to researchers. Another\ncharge is that the reaction of the brain\u2019s neuron depends on its history\nand thus cannot be compared with the computer. However, other\nresearchers seem to have anticipated this weakness and are working on\nelectronic or electrochemical neurons that also are conditioned by their\ninput. Despite criticism, the bionics work proceeds on a broad front.\n\nMore recently a machine called Cybertron has been developed by the\nRaytheon Company. This more sophisticated machine is being trained to\nrecognize sonar sounds, using the corrective technique. If Cybertron\nerrs, the teacher pushes a \u201cgoof\u201d button. When the machine is fully\ndeveloped, Raytheon feels it will be able to recognize all typical\nAmerican word sounds, using its 192 learning elements, and to type them\nout.\n\nComputers generally do \u201clogical\u201d operations. Many human problems do not\nseem to be logical, and can be solved only by experience, as the\nmathematician G\u00f6del demonstrated some years ago. Since Cybertron solves\nsuch \u201calogical\u201d problems, its builders prefer not to call it a computer,\nbut rather a self-organizing data-processor that adapts to its\nenvironment. Among the variety of tasks that Cybertron could perform are\nthe grading of produce and the recognition of radar signals. Raytheon\nforesees wide application for Cybertron as a master learner with\napprentice machines incapable of learning but able to \u201cpick the brains\u201d\nof Cybertron and thus do similar tasks.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory_\n\n  With the letter C in its field of view, Perceptron\u2019s photocells at top\n    center are activated. Simultaneously, response units in panel at\n    right identify the letter correctly.\n]\n\nThe assembly of machines like Perceptron and Cybertron requires elements\nthat simulate the brain\u2019s neuron. One such component which has evolved\nfrom bionics research is the Artron, or artificial neuron. Inside the\nArtron are logic gates and inhibit gates. By means of reward or\npunishment, the Artron learns to operate a \u201cstatistical switch\u201d and send\nimpulses to other Artrons or to a readout. There are two interesting\nparallels here besides the operation of a simulated neural net. One is\nthe statistical approach to decisions and learning. The late John von\nNeumann theorized that the brain\u2019s actions might be statistical, or\nbased on probability. Second, the designers of Artron see a similarity\nin its operation and Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection.\n\nAnother new component in the bionics approach is the \u201cneuristor.\u201d This\nsemiconductor diode simulates the axon, the nerve fiber that connects\nwith the neuron. Another device is the \u201cmemistor,\u201d unique in that it\nuses electrochemical phenomena to function as a memory unit. A different\nkind of artificial neuron called MIND is made up of magnetic cores.\n\nThere is another plus factor in this duplication of what we think is the\nsystem used by the brain. While one neuron may not be as reliable as a\nvacuum tube or transistor, the complete brain is millions of times more\ndependable than any of its single parts. This happy end result is just\nthe reverse of what man has come up with in his complex computer\nsystems. For instance, individual parts in the Minuteman missile must\nhave a reliability factor of 99.9993% so that the system will have a\nfair chance of working properly. Duplication of the brain\u2019s network may\nwell lead to electronic systems that are many times more reliable than\nany of their individual parts.\n\nBionics is apparently a fruitful approach, both for benefiting computer\ntechnology and for learning more about the human brain. As an example,\nconsider the fact that work with the Perceptron indicated that\npunishment was more effective in the learning process than punishment\nand reward together. This of course does not say that such a method\nwould work best with a human subject, but if separate tests with human\nbeings proved a similar result, it might then be safe to infer some\nsimilarity between the human and computer brain.\n\nOne of the biggest roadblocks to implementation of a humanlike neural\nnet is economic. Since there are some 10 billion neurons in the brain,\nand early electronic neurons consisted of several components including\ntransistors which are a bargain at $2 each, building such a computer\nmight double our national debt. Bionics workers have been thinking\ndreamily in terms of something like one cent per artificial neuron. This\nis a ridiculously low figure, but even at that a one-tenth brainpower\ncomputer with only a billion penny neurons would cost $10 million for\nthose components alone!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory_\n\n  Random wiring network between the Mark I Perceptron\u2019s 400 photocell\n    sensors and the machine\u2019s association units.... The Mark I has ten\n    sensory output connections to each of its 512 association units.\n]\n\nNot yet whipped, researchers are now thinking in terms of mass-producing\nlattices of thin metal, in effect many thousands of elements in a\nmicroscopic space, and propagating electrochemical waves rather than an\nelectrical current through them.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Raytheon Co._\n\n  When Cybertron doesn\u2019t catch on to a new lesson, engineers push the\n    goof button to punish the machine. When it learns correctly it is\n    allowed to continue its studies with no interruption, thus it\n    constantly improves its skill.\n]\n\nOther ideas include getting down to the molecular level for components.\nIf this is achieved it will be a downhill pull, for even the human\nneuron consists of many molecules. Farfetched as these ideas seem,\npackaging densities of 100 billion per cubic foot are being talked of as\nforeseeable in less than ten years. This is only about ten times as\nbulky as the goal, the human brain, and when it is achieved the computer\nwill be entitled to a big head.\n\n\n                      _The Computer as a Thinker_\n\nAbout the time Johnny was having all his trouble reading, a computer\nnamed JOHNNIAC was given the basic theorems needed, and then asked to\nprove the propositional calculus in the _Principia Mathematica_, a task\ncertainly over the heads of most of us. The computer waded through the\njob with no particular strain, and even turned in one proof more elegant\nthan human brains had found before. When the same problems were given to\nan engineer unfamiliar with that branch of mathematics, his verbalized\nproblem-solving technique paralleled that of JOHNNIAC. Asked if he had\nbeen thinking, the engineer said he \u201csurely thought so!\u201d\n\nIn his interesting department in _Scientific American_, mathematical\ngamester Martin Gardner describes a simple set of punched cards for\nsolving the type of logic problem discussed earlier in this chapter.\nUsing these cards and a simple digital type of manipulation, we happily\nlearn that Camille surely could. The problem is a simple, three-premise\ntype in two-valued logic and can be solved by any self-respecting\ndigital computer in a split second. A few demonstrations like this give\na rather disconcerting insight into our brain\u2019s limitations and build\nmore respect for the computer\u2019s intelligence.\n\nWhen we hear of expensive computers apparently frittering away their\nvaluable time playing games we may well wonder how come. But games, it\nturns out, are an ideal testing ground for problem-solving ability and\nhence intelligence. Back in 1957, computer experts Simon and Newell\npredicted that in ten years the chess champion of the world would be a\ncomputer. Master players most likely laughed up their sleeves, and thus\nfar the electronic machine has done no better than play a routine game\nagainst a human amateur. This, of course, is not a mean achievement.\nWise heads are supposed to have responded to the prediction with \u201cSo\nwhat?\u201d\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Photo at left from _Organization of the Cerebral Cortex_, by D. A\n    Sholl, J. Wiley and Sons. Right, _General Electric Research\n    Laboratory_\n\n  Photo at right shows a \u201ccrossed-film cryotron\u201d shift register\u2014an\n    advanced computer element. The separation of active crossovers shown\n    is comparable to the separation of nerve cells in the section of cat\n    brain shown at left.\n]\n\nAlex Bernstein of IBM worked out a program for the 704 computer in which\nthe machine looks ahead four moves before each of its plays. Even this\nlimited look ahead requires 2,800 calculations, and the 704 takes eight\nminutes deliberating. Occasionally it makes a move the experts rate as\nmasterful.\n\nChess is a far more complex game even than it appears to those of us on\nthe sidelines. In an average game there are forty moves and each has\nabout thirty possibilities. So far this sounds innocuous, but\nmathematics shows that there are thus 10^{120} possible moves in any one\ngame. This number is a 1 followed by 120 zeros, and to underline its\nsize it has been estimated that even if a million games a second were\nplayed, the possibilities would not be exhausted in our lifetime!\n\nObviously human chess wizards do not investigate all possible moves.\nInstead they use heuristic reasoning, or hunch playing, to cut corners.\nThe JOHNNIAC computer is investigating such approaches to\ncomputer-playing chess, in a movement away from rigorously programmed\nroutines or \u201calgorithms.\u201d Algorithms are formulas or equations such as\nthe quadratic equation used in finding roots. If indeed the computer\ndoes dethrone the human chess champ by 1967, it will be exceedingly hard\nto argue that the machine is not thinking.\n\nThe word \u201cheuristic\u201d comes from the Greek _heuriskein_, meaning to\ndiscover or invent. An example of what it is and how important it is can\nbe seen in the recent disproving of a famous conjecture made by the\nmathematician Euler some 180 years ago. Euler was interested in the\nproperties of so-called \u201cmagic squares\u201d in which letters are arranged\nvertically and horizontally. While it is possible to arrange the letters\n_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_ in such a square so that all are present in\neach row and in different order, Euler didn\u2019t think such was the case\nwith a square having six units on a side. He tried it, visualizing\nofficers of different rank arranged in rows. Convinced that it would not\nwork, he extended his educated guess to squares having units of ten,\nfourteen, and other even numbers not divisible by four. He didn\u2019t\nactually prove his conjecture, because the amount of paperwork makes it\npractically impossible.\n\nIn 1901 a mathematician did try all the possible configurations of the\nsquare of six units and found that Euler was indeed correct. It was\nassumed that ten was impossible too, until 1958 when three American\nmathematicians spoiled Euler\u2019s theory by finding workable magic squares\nhaving ten units per side. They did not do this by exhausting all the\npossibilities, for such a chore would have been humanly impossible. In\nfact, a computer labored for 100 hours and completed only a tiny\nfraction of the job. The square-seekers concluded that it would take\neven the high-speed computer upwards of a century to do the job, so\ninstead they used hunches or inspired guesses, working out a heuristic\nfor the task. The point of importance is that not only man, but the\ncomputer as well, despite its fantastic speed, must learn to use\nheuristic reasoning rather than blindly plowing through all possible\nsolutions. There are just too many numbers!\n\nComputers play other games too, from tick-tack-toe and Nim, which it\nplays flawlessly, to Go and checkers. Dr. Arthur Samuel of IBM has\ntaught the 704 computer to play checkers well enough to beat him\nregularly, though Dr. Samuel, scientist that he is, admits he is not a\ngreat checker-player. He has used two types of learning in the program:\n\u201crote\u201d and \u201cgeneralization.\u201d So far these have been used separately,\nwhile human players use both types of learning in a game.\n\nAmerican scientists visiting Russia recently reported that the Russians,\nlike some of us, were amazed to hear that computer time was allotted to\nthe mere playing of games. The real goal in all this game-playing is to\nlearn how to do other more important things. Gaming is being applied to\nwar strategy and to business management. Corporation executives are\nplaying games with computers that simulate the operation of their firms,\nboth to improve methods and to learn about themselves and their\nemployees. A General Problem-Solver computer is being developed too; one\nwhich can solve problems like the cannibals and the missionaries and\nthen do mathematical equations and other types of thinking. As was\npointed out, when the computer\u2019s method of solving a problem is compared\nwith the protocol used by a person (by having him think aloud as he goes\nthrough the problem) it is seen that both use pretty much the same\ntricks and short cuts.\n\nAs the computer keeps closing the gap, we can push the goal back by\nredefining our terms. This is much like dangling a carrot on a stick,\nand with the computer doggedly taking the part of the donkey, it is a\npretty good technological flail. By making the true test of intelligence\nsomething like artistic creativity, we can rule out the machine unless\nit can write poetry, compose music, or paint a picture. So far the\ncomputer has done the first two, and the last poses no particular\nproblem, though debugging the machine might be a messy operation. True,\nthe machine\u2019s poetry is only about beatnik level:\n\n\n                                CHILDREN\n\n           Sob suddenly, the bongos are moving.\n           Or could we find that tall child?\n           And dividing honestly was like praying badly,\n           And while the boy is obese, all blast could climb.\n           First you become oblong,\n           To weep is unctious, to move is poor.\n\nThis masterpiece, produced by a computer in the Librascope Laboratory\nfor Automata Research, is not as obscure as an Eliot or a Nostradamus.\nComputer music has not yet brought audiences to their feet in Carnegie\nHall. The machine\u2019s detractors may well claim that it has produced\nnothing truly great; nothing worthy of an Einstein or Keats or Vermeer.\nBut then, how many of us people have?\n\nThere is yet another way we can ban the computer from membership in our\nhuman society. While human beings occasionally think they are machines,\nand Dr. Bruno Bettelheim has documented a case history of \u201cJoey\u201d who was\nso convinced that he was a machine that he had to keep himself plugged\nin to stay alive, no machine has yet demonstrated that it is consciously\naware of itself, as human beings are.\n\nMachines are, hopefully, objective. Consciousness seems to be subjective\nin the extreme; indeed, some feel that it is a thing one of us cannot\nhope to convey as intelligence to another and thus has no scientific\nimportance. It is also noted that the thinking and learning processes\ncan be carried out with no need for consciousness of what we are doing.\nAn example given is that of the cyclist who learns, without being\n\u201caware\u201d of the fact, that to turn his machine left he must first make a\nslight swing to the right in order to keep from falling outward during\nhis left turn. This observation in itself is not final proof of the\npudding, of course, unless we are aiming only to make a mechanical\nbike-rider, but many of our other actions are carried out more or less\nmechanically without calling attention to themselves. Just as certainly,\nhowever, the thing called consciousness plays a vital role in human\nthinking. Perhaps the machine must learn to do this before it can be\ntruly creative.\n\nAlthough we have described some fairly \u201cexotic\u201d devices, it should be\nremembered that the computers in use outside of the laboratory today are\nfairly old-fashioned second-generation models. They have progressed from\nvacuum tubes or mechanical relays to \u201csolid-state\u201d components. When\nArtrons and neuristors and memistors and other more sophisticated parts\nare standard, we can look for a vast increase in the brain power of\ncomputers.\n\nThe Gilfillan radar ground-controlled-approach system for aircraft that\n\u201csees\u201d the plane on the radar scope, computes the proper path for it to\nfollow, and then selects the right voice commands from a stored-tape\nmemory seems to be thinking and acting already. The addition of eyes and\nears plus limbs and locomotion to the computer, foreseen now in the\nphotocell eyes of Perceptron, the ears of Cybertron, and dexterity of\nMobot and Hand, will move the computer from mere brain to robot.\n\nSome people profess to worry about what will happen when the computer\nitself realizes that it is thinking, calling to mind the apocryphal\nstory of the machine that was asked if there was a God. After brief\ncogitation, it said, \u201c_Now_ there is.\u201d To offset such a chilling\npossibility, it is comforting to recall the post-office electronic brain\nthat mistook the Christmas seals on packages for foreign stamps, and the\nArmy computer that ordered millions of dollars worth of supplies that\nweren\u2019t needed. Or perhaps it isn\u2019t comforting, at that!\n\nThe question of whether or not a computer actually thinks is still a\ncontroversy, though not as much so as it was a few years ago. The\ncomputer looks and acts as if it is thinking, but the true scientist\nprefers to reserve judgment in the spirit of one shown a black sheep\nsome distance away. \u201c_This_ side is black,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut let\u2019s\ninvestigate further.\u201d\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    \u201c_For forms of government let fools contest,\n    That which is best administered is best._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014Pope\n\n\n\n\n                        7: Uncle Sam\u2019s Computers\n\n\nThe modern electronic version of the computer is about fifteen years\nold, and like most teen-agers, it is a precocious child. To list all the\napplications in which it has made a place for itself would take several\npages and an inclusive listing from Airlines to Zoology. There are\nhundreds of different types, priced from less than one hundred dollars\nto more than ten millions. The latter are so expensive that outright\npurchase is not usually possible for users. Rental or leasing\narrangements are therefore available; and there are a growing number of\ncomputer centers to which the customer can take or send his work and\nhave it done. There are also do-it-yourself computer facilities, much\nlike those for laundry, dry cleaning, and so forth, as well as\ninstallations in trailers that move from place to place. Most require a\nsource of conventional electric power, but there are some portable\nmodels that operate on batteries.\n\nScanning the list of jobs the computer now does, it would seem\nimpossible to classify the varied tasks. Since many machines are\nversatile, general-purpose types, it is even more difficult to\ndefinitely categorize the computer. Dr. John R. Pierce, an expert at the\nBell Telephone Laboratories, describes some of the chores done by a\ndigital computer in a typical session at Bell:\n\nCheck parts of a computer program used in connection with machine\nmethods for processing manufacturing information.\n\nProcess and analyze data on telephone transmission which have been\ntransmitted to the laboratories by teletypewriter and automatically\npunched on cards for computer processing.\n\nSolve a partial differential equation.\n\nCompute details of the earth\u2019s magnetic field.\n\nCheck part of a program used to handle programming cards.\n\nFit curves to data by translating numerical information into graphs.\n\nLocate an error in a program designed to process psychological data.\n\nThese \u201csimple\u201d problems required but three minutes of the computer\u2019s\ntime. A larger task, something like solving 350 mathematical logic\ntheorems from _Principia Mathematica_, takes a bit longer\u2014eight and a\nhalf minutes, to be exact.\n\nDespite this versatility, it is generally possible to break the\ncomputer\u2019s capabilities down into broad classifications. First we can\nsay that it does either simple data-processing, or scientific\ncomputations. Each of these can then be further subdivided ad infinitum.\nExamples will be seen as we describe uses of computers on the following\npages. Since the government was the first user of computers, beginning\nback in 1890 with Hollerith\u2019s punched-card machines, we would do well to\nsee what other work it has put the computer to in the years that have\nelapsed.\n\n\n                      _The Computer in Washington_\n\nAn inventory of electronic computers installed in the Federal Government\nby the end of 1961 totaled 800, with 200 more on order. These figures\nare exclusive of those for tactical and classified use by the Department\nof Defense. Some 45,000 people are engaged in computer operations in the\ngovernment, and a total expenditure of about $1.5 billion is estimated.\nAn indication of the importance accorded the computer by Washington is\nthe Interagency Data Processing Committee, concerned with questions of\nsharing of computers in geographic areas, setting up of a \u201clibrary\u201d of\napplications, and assurance of continued computer operation in the event\nof attack or other emergency. Users of computers, in addition to the\nDepartment of Defense, are the Atomic Energy Commission, Department of\nCommerce, National Aeronautics and Space Agency, Federal Aviation\nAgency, Post Office Department, and others for a total of 43 agencies.\nThe Peace Corps, for example, recently announced that it would acquire a\ncomputer for use in its work.\n\nRed tape is not the only output from Washington, D.C. Not long ago the\nHoover Commission estimated that our Federal Government also produces 25\n_billion_ pieces of paper each year! Someone else converted this already\nimpressive statistic into the more startling information that placed end\nto end these papers would reach the moon four times\u2014in triplicate, of\ncourse! Data-processing, then, the handling of information, would seem\nto be the major part of the computer\u2019s work for Uncle Sam.\n\nThe Census Bureau was the first government user of the computer, and it\ncontinues to handle its work in this way. In 1951 the government\nprocured a UNIVAC I to take over this onerous chore from its\npredecessors. Beginning with the 1950 census, the computer has been in\noperation practically twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. In its\nfirst ten years it performed more than 510 billion mathematical\noperations in keeping pace with our exploding population. We are\nproducing more than paperwork, it seems. The 1950 census required four\nyears to process. With newer computers the 1960 count will take only\nhalf as long despite the population explosion.\n\nInformation-handling computers make possible another important phase of\nthe government\u2019s work. In 1936, machines began to process Social\nSecurity records, which are becoming a monumental pile of paperwork\nthemselves with close to 100 million accounts that must be kept up to\ndate. Social Security numbers recently turned up in government computers\nhandling another job\u2014that of income-tax bookkeeping.\n\nThe U.S. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Mortimer Caplin, put a pilot\nsystem of computer accounting of tax records into operation in January\nof 1962 in the Atlanta region. In 1963, the Philadelphia Center will\nfollow suit, and by 1966 all income-tax accounting will whiz through\ntape reels into computers. The figures on tax greenbacks laid end to end\nare not available, but it is known that 400 miles of magnetic tape will\nbe needed to hold all the records.\n\nThe new system will make it tough on the income-tax chiseler. Caplin\npoints out that not only the withholding-tax information from the\nemployer, and forms from the employee, but also dividend statements and\nother supplementary income information will funnel automatically into\nJohn Doe\u2019s portion of the tape. If John is moonlighting, holding down a\nsecond job he might forget to mention, the computer will spot it and\ncharge a tax on it. The apprehended tax-dodger may well call the\ncomputer an infernal revenue machine.\n\nThere are of course many other ways the computer is helping out in the\ncomplex problems of government, both Federal and local. The computer has\nalready figured in national elections, making predictions well in\nadvance as to the outcome. Now the machines are being used in the actual\nvoting procedure. In 1952 an IBM computer predicted Eisenhower\u2019s victory\nwithin two hours after the first polls closed. In the early days of\ncomputer predictions, the men using them were overly cautious and afraid\nto accept the machine\u2019s word. Techniques and confidence have improved\nwith practice, and in 1960 IBM\u2019s RAMAC predicted victory for Kennedy at\n8:12 P.M. election night.\n\nTo make accurate predictions, the computer is given information from\npreceding elections. In 1960 it was fed the results of the 1956, 1952,\n1948, and 1928 (because of the religious considerations) elections.\nForecasters were able to ask the computer such questions as, \u201cHow is\nNixon doing compared with Eisenhower\u2019s showing in 1952?\u201d \u201cHow is Kennedy\ndoing compared with Al Smith back in 1928?\u201d \u201cIs labor voting as a bloc?\u201d\nand \u201cHow solid is the South?\u201d The computer is now an accepted part of\nnetwork equipment for election reporting. ABC used the Remington Rand\nUNIVAC; CBS, IBM RAMAC and other machines; and NBC the RCA 501.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  Computers are used to predict the results of elections.\n]\n\nIn addition to forecasting results, computers are beginning to do other\nelection work. Los Angeles County experimented with a computer method of\ncounting votes in 1960. Greene County, Ohio, used punched cards for\nballots for 50,000 voters in a pioneering computer voting system. The\ncards were processed in a UNIVAC computer at Dayton Air Force Depot. A\nbolder suggestion is that of political scientist R. M. Goldman of\nMichigan State University: actual voting by telephone-operated computer!\n\nTo solve another problem area in voting, the use of computers was\nrecently proposed at a state congressional hearing in Boston.\nRedistricting, the bugaboo that led to \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d might well be\ndone by \u201cunbiased\u201d computers which would arrive at an optimum\nredistricting plan. These unbiased results would be \u201cbeyond politics and\nin the best interests of the voters and the State,\u201d according to the\ncomputer expert who proposed the plan.\n\nMoving from voting to a more complicated problem, that of urban renewal,\nthe University of Washington is conducting a survey under federal grant\non the extent of deterioration and the causes of decay in Spokane\nresidential, commercial, and industrial areas. The IBM 709 computer\nmakes possible an accurate and extensive survey expected to shed light\non areas of arrested development, and on the amount of tax revenue lost\nbecause of existing blight.\n\n\n                        _Electronic Legal Eagle_\n\nSome writers see the clearest evidence of the victory of the computer\u2014if\nindeed we admit to there ever having been any real battle\u2014in the\nadmission by the legal profession that it must begin to chart the legal\nseas of the computer age.\n\nIn 1961 the American Law Institute and the American Bar Association,\nfeeling that the computer will cast its \u201cautomated shadow on every phase\nof society,\u201d conducted a joint three-day seminar in Washington, D.C.\nTitled \u201cLegal Problems in the Use of Electronic Data Processing in\nBusiness, Industry and Law,\u201d the seminar discussed \u201cfunction and\noperation of computers and their impact on tort, tax, corporation,\nlabor, contract, banking, sales, antitrust, patent and copyright law, as\nwell as on the law of evidence and trial practice.\u201d\n\nLawyer Roy Freed of the Philadelphia Bar, in a booklet called \u201cA\nLawyer\u2019s Guide Through the Computer Maze,\u201d describes the working of the\nmachine and then poses some challenging legal questions.\n\nWhat duty does the company acting as a computer service organization\nhave to preserve the confidential nature of the data it processes for\nits customers?\n\nCan business records placed on magnetic tape be used in evidence, or\nmust the original records be preserved?\n\nHow long can corporate management lag behind others in their industry in\nadopting machine data-processing systems before they expose themselves\nto a mismanagement charge?\n\nTo what extent should the manufacturer of a complex product that has a\npotential for causing harm try to minimize his liability as a maker by\nanticipating design defects through simulated operation on the computer?\n\nOther legal experts asked other questions. If an electronically\nprocessed check is bounced erroneously, who is responsible? If a\nnoncomputerized railroad has a train wreck, can the road be sued on the\npremise that the accident would not have occurred with modern traffic\ncontrols? Or if the reverse occurs, can an anticomputer claimant win a\nsuit against the machine?\n\nApplications of the computer in patent law may lead to more thorough\nsearch in addition to higher speed. This could well clear another\nbottleneck by issuing fewer and faster patents. But copyright violation\nproblems lie in the possibility of making copies of tapes or other media\nsuitable for the computer\u2019s use. The altering or falsification of\ncomputer data also poses a tricky legal problem; there is already a\nprecedent in the Wall Street man who juggled the punched cards on the\ncomputer to his own advantage.\n\nPerhaps there was one question none of the lawyers present had the\ncourage to bring up: what if the day comes when the court itself is a\ncomputer, and the case is presented to it as a stack of cards, or a\nprepunched or magnetized tape? Such a mechanized justice was fancifully\ndepicted on a television thriller by Ray Bradbury.\n\n\n                          _Computers in Khaki_\n\nDespite the low IQ it has been accused of, it was inevitable that the\ncomputer be drafted. In the 40\u2019s we were desperate. Included in\ngovernment use of computers are military research, development, and\ntactical and strategic methods. World War II was a different kind of\nwar, a complicated, electronic war that required advanced methods of\noperation. At Eastertime in 1942, IBM answered an urgent call from\nWashington and gathered all available data-processing machines for use\nby the military. Punched cards kept track of allotments, insurance, and\nthe logistics of running a war. Mobile computing machines operated close\nto the front lines, and were important enough that a captured German\nofficer was carrying urgent orders to bring in one of these units.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Motorola, Inc., Military Electronics Division_\n\n  Technician checks circuitry of airborne digital computer.\n]\n\nBesides the mundane effort of mere data-processing, wartime computers\ndid important cloak-and-dagger work as well. A report came in from\nAllied intelligence that the Germans were working on a frightening new\ndevelopment\u2014an electrically powered cannon. If it were successful we\nwould need some kind of counterweapon. But the dike was leaking in a\nhundred other places too, and there was not time or equipment to do\neverything it seemed we might have to do. The answer was to feed some\ncomplex mathematics to an IBM computer called the Automatic Sequence\nControlled Calculator\u2014mathematics describing the new cannon. The\ncomputer cogitated briefly and decided that the Germans were on the\nwrong track; that the gun would not work. We therefore ignored the\nthreat, letting the Germans waste their valuable time going down the\nblind alley, and turned our efforts elsewhere.\n\nWe have said that World War II was a different kind of war. One new\ndevelopment to bear out this difference was called \u201cOperations\nResearch\u201d\u2014the reduction of any program to mathematical formulas and the\ninvestigation of these formulas rather than a conventional, intuitive\napproach. The technique was pioneered in England, spread to the United\nStates, and is now one of the most powerful tools not only of the\nmilitary but also of government and business. The computer has made\noperations research a more powerful technique by permitting the analysis\nof thousands or millions of possibilities in hours instead of lifetimes.\n\nBack in the days of bows and arrows, the soldier had no need for a\ncomputer. Even the rifleman required little more than a simple sight and\nmaybe a bit of Kentucky windage. With the coming of long-range\nartillery, computers became desirable, and now we have moved into an age\nof warfare that would be impossible without high-speed computing\nmachines.\n\nIn 1948 IBM introduced a computer known as SSEC for Selective Sequence\nElectronic Calculator. This machine was put to work on a problem for the\nLos Alamos Atomic Energy Laboratory, a problem called \u201cHippo.\u201d Hippo was\nas unwieldy as its name, requiring some nine million involved\nmathematical operations that would have taken about 1,500 man-years of\nskilled time. That many mathematicians or that much time was not\navailable, of course, and SSEC clicked through the job in 150 hours by\nitself. Another computer, the MANIAC, designed by John von Neumann, is\ncredited with beating the Russians to the punch with the hydrogen bomb.\n\nAs an outgrowth of operations research, the simulation of war games has\nbecome an important part of military work. A number of firms, including\nSystem Development Corporation, Technical Operations, Inc., and others,\ndevote much of their time to \u201cplaying games\u201d to work out the optimum\nstrategy and tactics for war in case we find it necessary again.\n\nIt is perhaps not paradoxical that war be considered a game. As William\nCowper said, \u201cWar\u2019s a game, which were their subjects wise, Kings would\nnot play at.\u201d The game of chess, conversely, stems from war and its\ntactics. Indeed, the term checkmate, for victory, comes from the Persian\nwords _shah mat_, the king is dead.\n\nThrough the years many war games have been developed, games which\neliminate the physical conflict but preserve the intellectual\nmaneuvering necessary for waging \u201cwar.\u201d John von Neumann was one of the\nmore recent to turn his great genius to this subject in the development\nof his \u201cminimax\u201d theory. This is an outline of a situation in which\nconsequences of decisions depend on the actions of an opponent. We have\nseen that the computer, though not yet world champion, can play chess;\nthe minimax theory is more grist for its electronic mill.\n\nTech-ops operates the Combat Operations Research Group for the U.S.\nContinental Army Command at Fort Monroe, Virginia. Among the games\nplayed here with computers are SYNTAC, in which field-experienced\nofficers evaluate new weapons and tactics, and AUTOTAG, a computer\nsimulation of tank-antitank combat. Other projects of this firm include\nair battle simulations, ship loading and other logistics problems,\nfallout studies, and defense against missile attacks. The beauty of such\nschemes is that we will not make the mistake of the Germans with their\nelectric cannon. When the computer blinks \u201cTilt\u201d or an equivalent, the\nengineers may have red faces, but no huge amount of time or money will\nhave been spent before they sigh, \u201cBack to the old drawing board!\u201d\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Aeronutronic Division, Ford Motor Co._\n\n  ARTOC (Army Tactical Operations Central) uses computer techniques for\n    battlefield display and communications to aid field commanders.\n]\n\nAt Picatinny Arsenal, computers evaluate ammunition by simulating as\nmany as a thousand battles per item. Design and management studies for\nprojects like Nike-Zeus and Davy Crockett are also conducted at\nPicatinny. A mobile computer, called MOBIDIC, is designed for field\ncombat use and has been moved in three 30-foot trailers to location with\nthe Seventh Army in Europe. There it handles requisitions for rockets,\nguided missiles, electronic equipment, and other items. MOBIDIC is just\npart of the Army\u2019s FIELDATA family of computers that includes\nhelicopter-transported equipment to provide field commanders with fast\nand accurate data on which to base their risk decisions. Another concept\nis ARTOC, for Army Tactical Operations Central, an inflatable command\npost in which computers receive and process information for display on\nlarge screens. This is a project of Aeronutronic.\n\nIn 1961 an IBM 7090 computer was installed at Ispra, Italy, for use by\nthe European Atomic Energy Commission (EURATOM). The computer would have\nas its duties the cataloging of technical information on atomic energy,\nthe translation of technical publications, and use in basic research on\nsolutions of Boltzmann equations and other advanced physics used in\natomic work. In this country, the National Science Foundation has\nacknowledged the importance of the computer in scientific investigation\nby underwriting costs for such equipment for research centers in need of\nthem.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  Command post of SAGE, the most complex computer application to date.\n]\n\n\n                              _In the Air_\n\nBeyond the realm of war gaming, the computer also forms the heart of the\nhardware that such simulation and studies develop. SAGE is an example of\nthis, a complex warning system that protects our country from attack.\nThe acronym SAGE is a more dignified and impressive name than the words\nit stands for\u2014Semi-Automatic Ground Environment, an environment that by\n1965 will have cost $61 billion!\n\nSage is not a single installation, but a vast complex of centers feeding\ninformation from Ballistic Missile Early Warning Site radar and airborne\nradar, from ships, Texas towers, and ground-based radar, and from\nweather stations into a central control. This control sends the proper\nsignals to defensive rockets, missiles, and aircraft for action against\nan invader. It does this with one hand, while with the other it keeps\ntabs on normal military and commercial air traffic.\n\nThe System Development Corporation designed and IBM built the SAGE\ncomputer, a computer already old-fashioned since it uses vacuum tubes\ninstead of the newer transistor devices. Despite this shortcoming, it\ndoes a fantastic job of tracking all the aircraft and missiles in its\nken, labeling them for speed, heading, altitude, as well as the vital\ninformation of friend or foe, and continuously plans a defense. Since it\ncan monitor civilian traffic as well, SAGE may one day take over control\nof that too. Thus the money spent will yield a bonus in addition to the\nprotection SAGE has already afforded in its military role.\n\nThe Air Force uses airborne computers by the thousands. Indeed, the need\nfor small lightweight computers for applications in aircraft led to\nearly work in the miniaturization of components that made possible tiny\ncomputers for missile and space use. Small digital computers were built\nfor \u201cdrone\u201d aircraft navigation; now more advanced computers provide\n\u201cair data,\u201d air-speed, altitude, flight attitude, pressure, and other\ninformation.\n\nOther Air Force computers, used in BMEWS radar, take the place of human\nobservers. These smart computers can recognize radar tracks that are\npotential missile trajectories, discriminate among these tracks to\nselect hostile trajectories, and project them to impact points and\ntimes. Called MIPS, for Missile Impact Predictor Set, the computer takes\nover from its human forerunner who just can\u2019t seem to perform the\n200,000 operations a second required to do the job.\n\nAnother space-tracking computer called SPADATS has been installed at\nNORAD Combat Operations Center at Colorado Springs. This computer has\nthe assignment of around-the-clock cataloging of all man-made objects in\nspace, a sizable and growing task. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, the Air\nForce maintains an EDP, or Electronic Data Processing project with a\nmore earth-bound job of cataloging. Started back in 1957, this project\nhas as its primary task the efficient allocation of manpower for the\nglobal Strategic Air Command team.\n\nAt nearby Edwards Air Force Base, an IBM 7090 computer is helping to\ndevelop the Dyna-Soar manned space glider. This computer is also doing\nwork for the X-15 program, and research on fuels, lunar probes, rocket\nnozzles, and nose cones. At Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, a new\nsystem of keeping track of jet engine parts, so that they go back on the\nproper engine, uses a recorder \u201cgun\u201d wired to a central control\ncomputer. Engine parts are metal tagged with coded letters which the\nrecorder \u201creads\u201d and transmits to the computer for filing.\n\nComputers play a big part in the \u201clargest and most sophisticated\nlogistic data and message communications system in the world.\u201d Delivered\nto the Air Force in January of 1962, \u201cComlognet\u201d connects 450 different\nair bases and other installations. This system started out modestly,\nhandling about 10 million punched cards a day, and is heralded as only a\nforerunner of an automatic system which will some day take care of the\ncomplete interflow of data among widely separated military and civilian\nlocations.\n\nBesides being part of complex navigation and bombing systems, computers\nhelp the Air Force to score the results of practice bombing missions.\nComputers control the launching of Sidewinder missiles from aircraft and\nalso permit accurate \u201ctoss-bombing\u201d of nuclear payloads from fighter\nbombers. These computers do all the mathematics and let the pilot\napproach his target from any direction, at any speed and altitude. The\nnew Skybolt ballistic missile, launched from the B-52 bomber, has its\nown guidance computer, which is actually a digital differential\nanalyzer, a hybrid device like that described in an earlier chapter. One\nof the largest single computers in the Air Force is that called Finder.\nUsing 70,000 transistors, it does analytical work on electronic\ncountermeasures.\n\nToday there are some 110,000 aircraft flying the skies in this country,\nabout double the number ten years ago. Not only the quantity but also\nthe speed of aircraft has increased, and the job of the aircraft\ncontroller has become a nightmare. With the lives of air travelers in\nhis hands, this overworked FAA employee has until recently used the same\nequipment that served in the days of 180 miles-per-hour piston-engine\ntransports.\n\nWe have discussed some examples of the computer as a director of air\ntraffic; the automatic ground-controlled-approach system that lands\nplanes in bad weather without human help is one, the mighty SAGE defense\nsystem is another. SAGE may one day take over commercial air traffic: in\nthe meantime, the Federal Aviation Agency relies heavily on smaller\ncomputers in locations all over the country.\n\nOriginally, general-purpose business computers were put to work\nprocessing the vast quantities of data needed to keep traffic flowing\nalong the airways. New, special designs, including those of the\nLibrascope Division of General Precision, Inc., are being added as they\nbecome available. Remington Rand UNIVAC is also working on the problem,\nand UNIVAC equipment has been tested on Strategic Air Command\nround-robin flights. It has posted as many as eighty in-flight Axes for\none mission, a feat that the unaided human controller can only gasp at.\n\nObviously, control of aircraft cannot be turned over pell-mell from\nhuman to computer. The FAA is proceeding cautiously, and a recent report\nfrom an industry fact-finding board recommended a \u201cProject Beacon\u201d\napproach which will continue to rely heavily on radar plus human\ncontrollers. But when the problems of communication between man and\nmachine are worked out, no human being can keep track of so many\naircraft so accurately, or compute alterations in course to prevent\ncollision and ensure an optimum use of air space as can the computer.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                              _On the Sea_\n\nThe Navy uses computers too. At the David Taylor Test Basin in Maryland,\na UNIVAC LARC is busy doing design work on ship hulls. Other computers\nmounted in completed Navy vessels perform navigation and gun-ranging\nfunctions. At New London, Connecticut, a Minneapolis-Honeywell computer\nsimulates full scale naval battles. Radar and sonar screens in mock\nsubmarine command posts show the maneuvering of many ships in realistic\nsimulations. Polaris submarines depend on special computers to launch\ntheir missiles, and the missiles themselves mount tiny computers that\nnavigate Polaris to its target. Another computer task was the \u201csea\ntesting\u201d of the nuclear submarine \u201cSea Wolf\u201d before it was launched!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Photo courtesy of _Litton Systems, Inc._\n\n  Airborne computer-indicator system in Hawkeye naval aircraft. This\n    equipment performs task of surveillance, tracking, command and\n    control.\n]\n\nComputers are being used by the Navy in a project that has tremendous\napplications not only for military application but for civilian use as\nwell. Mark Twain to the contrary, a lot of people have tried to do\nsomething about the weather, among them an Englishman named Richardson.\nBack in 1922 he came up with the idea of predicting the weather for a\ngood-sized chunk of England. Basically his ambitious scheme was sound.\nDrawing on weather stations for the data, he determined to produce a\n24-hour forecast.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Richardson, the English, and the world in general,\nthe mathematics required was so complicated that he labored for three\nmonths on that first prediction. By then it had lost much of its\nvalue\u2014and it was also wrong! The only solution that Richardson could\nthink of was to enlist the aid of about 60,000 helpers who would be\npacked into a huge stadium. Each of these people would be given data\nupon which to perform some mathematical operation, and then pass on to\nthe next person in line. Pages would transfer results from one section\nof the stadium to another, and a \u201cconductor,\u201d armed with a megaphone\nundoubtedly along with his baton, would \u201cdirect\u201d the weather symphony,\nor perhaps cacaphony. As he lifted his baton, the helpers were to\ncalculate like crazy, when he lowered it they would pass the result\nalong. What Richardson had invented, of course, was the first\nlarge-scale computer, a serial computer with human components. For a\nnumber of reasons, this colossal machine was never completed. It was\nobviously much easier to simply damn the weatherman.\n\nActually, Richardson had stumbled onto something big. He had brought\ninto being the idea of \u201cnumerical weather prediction.\u201d It is known that\nweather is caused by the movement of air and variations in its pressure.\nBasically it is simple, knowing pressure conditions yesterday and today,\nto project a line or extrapolate the conditions for tomorrow. If we know\nthe conditions tomorrow, we can then predict or forecast the\ntemperature, precipitation, and winds.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _U.S. Navy_\n\n  Weather map prepared and printed out by computer gives data in\n    graphical form. Enlarged view of weather \u201cpicture\u201d (above) shows how\n    it is formed by printed digits representing the pressure at\n    reporting stations.\n]\n\nThere was even the mathematics to make this possible in Richardson\u2019s\nday: the so-called \u201cprimitive equations\u201d of the pioneer mathematician\nEuler. These are six partial differential equations involving velocity,\npressure, density, temperature, and so on. But though the principle is\nsimple, the practical application is hopelessly involved\u2014unless you have\na stadium filled with 60,000 willing mathematicians or a fast computer\nof some other type.\n\nIn 1950 the stage was finally set for the implementation of numerical\nweather prediction. First, electronic computers were available. Second,\nand importantly, mathematician C. G. Rossby had worked some magic with\nthe original primitive equations and reduced them to a single neat\nequation with only four terms. The new tool is called the Rossby\nequation. Meteorologists and mathematicians at Princeton\u2019s Institute for\nAdvanced Study decided to combine the Rossby equation, the MANIAC\ncomputer, and some money available from the Office of Naval Research.\nThe result was JNWPU, Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit, later to\nbecome NANWEP, for Navy Numerical Weather Problems Group. It is too bad\nthat pioneer Richardson did not live to see the exploitation of his\ndream.\n\nWhat NANWEP does is to take the meteorological data from some 3,000\nreporting stations, compare them with those existing yesterday, and\nprint out a weather map for the Northern Hemisphere for tomorrow.\nBecause there are so many more stations reporting than the handful that\nRichardson used, the number of computations has risen to the\nastronomical total of about 300,000,000. Despite this, a Control Data\nCorporation 1604 digital computer does the job in a good bit less time\nthan the three months it took Richardson. NANWEP prints out its weather\nmaps 40 minutes from the time all data are in.\n\nTeletype reports come in from the thousands of weather stations; these\nare punched on tape and fed to the 1604. Since the information includes\ngeographical position in addition to meteorological data, the computer\nprints out numbers that form a map of weather coming up. Although the\nmeteorologist adds some clarifying lines by connecting points of equal\npressure, the \u201craw\u201d map with its distinctive shaded areas is meaningful\neven to the layman.\n\nFurther refinements are in the offing. As many as 10,000 weather\nstations may eventually report to the central computer, which may also\nlearn to accept the teletype information directly with no need for the\nintermediate step of punching a tape. Although it will be a long time\nbefore a positive forecast, exact in every detail, is possible, NANWEP\nalready has lifted weather prediction from the educated guesswork of the\nolder meteorologists to truly scientific forecasting.\n\nIt turns out that numerical weather prediction brings with it some\nbonuses. NANWEP can predict the action of ocean waves three days in\nadvance, in addition to its regular wind, temperature, and precipitation\ninformation. So it is now being put to work preparing optimum routes for\nships. Here\u2019s the way it would work. A ship sailing from California to\nJapan requests the best routes for the voyage. Initially the computer is\ngiven the ship\u2019s characteristics and told how it will perform in various\nsea conditions. It then integrates this information with the predicted\nsea conditions for the first day\u2019s leg, and plots several different\ncourses. Distances the ship would travel on each of these courses are\nplotted, and a curve is drawn to connect them. Now the computer repeats\nthe process for the next day, so that each of the tentative courses\nbranches out with its own alternates. The process is repeated for each\nof the five days of the voyage. Then the computer works backward,\npicking the best route for the entire voyage, and gives the course to be\nfollowed for optimum time. If that isn\u2019t sufficiently informative for\nthe captain, he can request and receive not one but three courses: one\nfor the fastest trip regardless of sea condition, another for the\nfastest trip with waves of only a certain height, and finally a course\nfor the fastest trip through calm water! The advantages of such a\nservice are immediately obvious and give a hint at many other\napplications of the technique to air travel, truck transport, and so on.\n\nNANWEP is ground-based, of course. There are also airborne weather\ncomputers like those of the U.S. Weather Bureau\u2019s National Severe Storm\nResearch Aircraft Project. The Weather Bureau has jumped its computer\nbudget from $1.5 to $2.5 million to extend this and other projects. The\ncompact airborne computers ride along in DC-6 and B-57 aircraft to\nmonitor hurricanes off Florida and tornadoes in the Great Plains area.\nThe computers gather forty different kinds of information and convert it\nto digital form at thousands of characters a second. Such monitoring of\nviolent weather by means of computers suggests an intriguing use of the\nmachine. Man has long considered the prospect of going the step beyond\nweather recording and prediction to actually changing or even creating\nhis own weather. He has done a few rather startling things of this kind,\nadmittedly on a small scale but with tremendous implications.\nCloud-seeding experiments are samples, as attempts both to induce\nprecipitation and to create or destroy storms. These experiments, though\ninconclusive, have led to results\u2014including precipitation of lawsuits\nand ill feeling. Meteorologists attempted to divert a hurricane along\nthe Atlantic coast line once, apparently with results. But the storm\nswerved too far and the weathermen incurred the justifiable wrath of\nthose living in the area affected. Why not simulate such an experiment\nin the computer? Besides being safer, it is also far cheaper. In the\nlong run, we may do something about the weather at that.\n\n\n                          _Computers in Space_\n\nThere are many points in history when seemingly fortuitous happenings\ntake place. The invention of the printing press appears to have occurred\nat a fork in the road as literature flowered. The discovery of gasoline\nand the automobile went hand in hand. So it is with the electronic\ncomputer and the spacecraft. Is the computer here because it was needed\nfor such an application, or did it actually cause the advent of space\nflight? Our conclusions must depend on our belief or disbelief in such\nthings as causality. A realistic view might be merely to applaud and\nappreciate the confluence of two important streams of thought to make a\nriver that will one day flow to the other planets and finally out of the\nsolar system entirely.\n\nPutting even something so unsophisticated as a brick into orbit would\nrequire the plotting of an exact trajectory handily done only by a\ncomputer. Sending the Mercury capsule aloft obviously requires a more\nrefined aiming system, and its re-entry into the atmosphere demands a\nnicety of calculation measured in a fraction of a degree. The same is\ntrue for the Russian achievements in sending a space vehicle around the\nmoon, and manned capsules in prolonged orbit. Such navigation can be\nplanned and carried out only by the sophisticated mathematics of a\ncomputer. Dr. Wernher von Braun has said that any effective\nspace-vehicle firing program would be impossible without computers and\ncomputing techniques.\n\nNot long ago, the mariner could leisurely brace himself on the deck of\nhis vessel and take a noon sight with his sextant. It mattered little if\nit took him some time to work out the computations; his ship traveled at\nonly a few knots and in only two dimensions. Today the space capsule or\nmissile moves as far in a single minute as a ship might in an entire\nday, and it moves not across the practically flat surface of the sea but\nthrough three-dimensional space in which that third degree of freedom is\nof vital importance. Not only must the navigation be done with fantastic\nprecision, it must be done in \u201creal time\u201d to be of any value. This is\ntrue whether the mathematics is being done by a Mercury capsule or one\nof our antimissile missiles. Just as Richardson\u2019s weather prediction\nthree months after the fact was of little use, the trajectory of an\ninvading missile will avail us nothing if it takes us thirty minutes to\ncompute. The problem by then, for the survivors, will be one of fallout\nand not blast.\n\nFor this reason a computer is aboard practically every space vehicle\nthat leaves the earth. The Atlas and Titan, the Minuteman and Polaris,\nall are controlled by tiny digital computers in their innards,\nsupplemented by more complex machines on the ground. These ground\ncomputers calculate the trajectory, then monitor the missile to correct\nits course if necessary. Complex as these functions seem, they are\nchildishly simple by comparison with the kind of calculations that are\nnecessary for lunar or planetary flight.\n\nA mathematician who knew his astronomy could work out the figures\nnecessary to launch a space craft on its flight to Venus, but he would\nhave to start some time before launching day. In fact, it would take\nforty generations of mathematicians to do the job. The trip itself would\nconsume about four months. At the Jet Propulsion Laboratories of the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, this 800-year project is planned and\nflown in thirty seconds by an IBM 7090 computer. For example, the\ncomputer tells us that if we had blasted off bright and early on August\n17, 1962, we could make it to the Clouded Planet at 10:09 A.M., December\n9. The curved trip through space would cover 32,687,000 miles.\n\nThe computer, then, not only can perform in real time but can even\nshrink time. The Venus trip is simulated daily at the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratories, and tapes stored in the computer cabinets also bear the\nnames Moon, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, and so on. When the day comes to make\nthe actual voyage, the odds are good that because of what scientists\nhave learned from the computer the trip will go as smoothly as all the\nsimulations. Rather than the planetary voyages, which are still some\ntime off, lunar soft landings will be among the first to demonstrate the\naccuracy of simulations now being made by General Dynamics, whose\nAtlas-Centaur will put the lunar rover Surveyor on the moon shortly.\nApollo, the three-man lunar spaceship, won\u2019t be far behind.\n\nNot long ago a computer was put to work to see if it could pare down the\ncosts of the Atlas and Thor rocket engines. We have to have such\ndefensive weapons, but the cheaper we can make them the more we can\nafford. The economy program worked, reducing costs more than a third.\n\n\n                               _Summary_\n\nThe computer is on the Washington payroll to stay, and it may well move\nup the hierarchical ladder there. It was not a comedian but an M.I.T.\nprofessor who recently suggested that the computer will replace the\nbureaucrat. Contending that the computer is inherently more flexible\nthan the bureaucrat, Professor John McCarthy told an Institute of Radio\nEngineers meeting that the machines will not regiment us. \u201cOn the\ncontrary, I think we can expect a great deal more politeness from\nmachines than we have gotten from humans,\u201d he said. His views were\ndebated by other panelists, but the gauntlet seems to have been flung.\nWith a party affiliation, the computer may well run for president\nsomeday!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Lichty, \u00a9 _Field Enterprises, Inc._\n\n  \u201cIt IS human, men!...

Business is faced with the same problems as government, plus\nothers perhaps, and can use the same techniques in planning, producing,\nmerchandising, and keeping track of its products. To General Electric\ngoes the distinction of first installing the large-scale electronic\ncomputer for its business-data processing. This was done quite recently,\nin 1954. Commenting on the milestone, the _Harvard Business Review_ said\nin part:\n\nThe revolution starts this summer at General Electric Company\u2019s new\nAppliance Park near Louisville, Kentucky. The management planning behind\nthe acquisition of the first UNIVAC to be used in business may\neventually be recorded by historians as the foundation of the second\nindustrial revolution; just as Jacquard\u2019s automatic loom in 1801 or\nFrederick W. Taylor\u2019s studies of the principles of scientific management\na hundred years later marked turning points in business history.\n\nIt is early yet for comment from historians, but the growth of the\nbusiness computers from the pioneer UNIVAC bears out the theme of the\n_Harvard Business Review_ suggestion. In 1961 there were 6,000 large\nelectronic computers in use; General Electric alone has more than 100.\nOne big reason for this is the fact that government is not alone in its\noutput of paperwork. It has been estimated that one-sixth of our Gross\nNational Product, or about $85 billion, is devoted to paper-handling. In\nthe time it takes to read this chapter, for example, Americans are\nwriting 4 million checks, and this is only a small part of the paperwork\ninvolved in the banking business.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _General Electric Co., Computer Dept._\n\n  First National Bank of Arizona personnel operate sorters during\n    initial operation of a new GE-210 computer-controlled\n    data-processing system. The sorters process bank checks at the rate\n    of 750 per minute as printer (foreground) prints bank statements at\n    900 lines per minute.\n]\n\nWholesale banks have been called fiscal intelligence agencies, doing\nbusiness by the truckload, and measuring the morning mail by the ton.\nYet this information is dealt with not only in volume, but in precise\nand accurate detail. If a client asks about the rating of a customer who\nhas just ordered several million dollars worth of goods, the bank may be\ncalled on to furnish this information in a very short time, even though\nthe customer resides halfway around the world.\n\nSince they deal in figures, it is logical that banks were among the\nfirst businesses to be computerized. Many of us are aware of those\nstylized numbers now on the bottom of most of our checks, and vaguely\nconscious that through some mysterious juggling by computers called ERMA\nand other such names banks balance our accounts at electronic speed.\n\nInsurance companies were next in line as computer candidates. Like\nbanking, insurance is believed to have been available to Babylonian\nmerchants thousands of years ago. In those days there were fewer people,\nand probably claims were fewer; the abacus was the only computer needed\nto keep pace. But since insurance was introduced on the North American\ncontinent, coincidentally in the same state, Pennsylvania, as banking,\nit has been threatened with drowning in a sea of its own policies.\n\nThe computer is ideally suited for doing the work of the insurance\nbusiness. There is no question today that the computer has taken over\nfrom the insurance clerk. One firm installed computers in 1953 and since\nthen has doubled its accounts and tripled dollar volume, without hiring\nthe 250 additional people who normally would have been required for such\nan increase. Eight outlying offices have been closed, yet service is\nbetter and faster, agents\u2019 commissions are paid twice a month instead of\nonly once, and actuarial computations that once took six months are now\ndone in a week.\n\nA computerized world is of course not without its problems. The computer\nsystem is so efficient, in fact, that the same outcry is going up from\nlabor as was heard in the days of the first industrial revolution. It\nhas been said with some truth that automation upgrades jobs, and not the\nworkers themselves. The change-over from quill pen to pushbutton console\nwill take some time and cause some pain, but in the end our gain will be\nas great a stride as we have made since the days of the introduction of\nthe first factories with their more efficient production methods. Surely\nthe business worker already has been freed from the tedium of adding\ncolumns of figures and much filing, and given pleasanter work in\nexchange.\n\n\n                         _The Shopper\u2019s Friend_\n\nAfter banking and insurance, which businesses yield to the lure of\nhigh-speed automatic data-processing? Department stores are dabbling,\nand supermarkets too are beginning to use the computer. The A & P stores\nare studying such a system, as is the Liggett Drug Company. At first the\ncomputer looked attractive as an inventory and ordering tool; now it is\nheaded in the direction of automating the actual shopping operation.\n\nIn Paris, a retail grocer made merchandising history by displaying more\nthan 3,000 different items in a floor space of only 230 square feet. The\ntrick is in a punched-card system that automatically registers and\nprices any item the buyer selects. At the check stand the card is run\nthrough a computer which figures the bill and orders the groceries,\nwhich are automatically selected from the warehouse and delivered in a\ncart to the purchaser at the door!\n\nA similar automatic supermart system is being pushed by Solartron\u2014John\nBrown, Ltd., in England. The computerized scheme works much like the\nFrench one. The shopper inserts a card in the slot beside the item she\nwants and a punch marks it in alpha-numeric code for item and price. If\nmore than one item is desired the card is reinserted. With each punch,\nthe machine slices off a bit of the edge of the card so that it slides\ndeeper into the slot next time. At the cashier\u2019s station, the card is\nplaced in a computer. Fifteen seconds after she has paid for them, the\nshopper is delivered her groceries. Besides the saving in time for the\nshopper, there is a saving for the grocer in floor space and also the\nelimination of the loss through shoplifting. About the only thing that\nmight seem to be against the new system is the psychology of the large\ndisplay, which motivation researchers tell us stimulates volume buying.\n\nWith this factor in mind, an official of Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc.,\nhas suggested retaining the large stocks on display, but coding them\nwith fluorescent paint of certain wavelengths to correspond to price.\nThe shopper fills her cart even as in the conventional store, but at the\nmechanized checkstand an electronic eye on the computer scans and prices\nthe items while they are being automatically packaged. The doubting\nThomases say of this system that the packager will probably put the eggs\non the bottom, along with the tomatoes and ice cream!\n\nThe advertising journal _Commercial Art_ comments sadly on this accepted\nfact of automation in the market place:\n\nThe checkout clerk is doomed, that last survivor of human warmth in most\nof today\u2019s supermarkets. His eventual executioner will be the electronic\ncomputer, of course. Pilot systems using computers for automatic\ncheckouts are already drawing a bead on the jovial little man in the\ngreen smock. Eventually even he will disappear from the faceless canyons\nof our sleek supermarkets.\n\nBut the writer finds a ray of hope in the conclusion of his editorial.\n\nSkilfully designed packages can strike an emotional chord in the\nconsumer, can create strong brand preferences even in the absence of\nproduct differences. Supermarkets can give the appearance of being a\nfriendly, \u201chuman\u201d place to shop even if the only humans visible are the\ncustomers.\n\nTo make more complete the rout of conventional merchandising by the\ncomputer-oriented system is the plan to automate even the trading stamp.\nAmerican Premium Systems, Inc., a Texas firm, is developing a plan in\nwhich the customer receives a coded plastic card instead of a stamp\nbook. When he makes a purchase, a card is punched with the number of\ncredits he has earned. By means of a centralized computer, an IBM 1401\nin this instance, records are kept continuously, and when the customer\nhas accrued 1,500 points he receives a premium automatically. The\nobvious advantage here is to the customer, who is spared the messy task\nof licking thousands of evil-tasting multicolored stamps, and the danger\nof losing the book before redemption. But the storekeeper profits too.\nHe does not risk the loss or theft of stamps, nor does he buy stamps for\npeople who are not going to save them. The complete system will call for\nan IBM 7074 and represents an outlay of about $3 million to service some\n6 million customer accounts.\n\nBefore leaving the area of merchandising, it might be well to mention\ninventory management in general and the effect of the computer upon it.\nApplying what is known as \u201cconceptual order analysis,\u201d one marketer who\nis using computers in his business talks of \u201cwarehousing without bricks\nor mortar.\u201d With a confidence born of actual testing, his firm expects\none day to have _no_ inventory except that on his production lines or in\ntransit to a customer. This revolutionary idea is based on practically\ninstantaneous inventorying, production ordering, and delivery\nscheduling. While the warehouse without bricks or mortar is not yet a\nfact, research discloses many manufacturers who have already cut their\nstanding inventories, from small amounts to as much as 50 per cent,\nwhile maintaining customer service levels. This was done using what by\nnow are \u201cstandard\u201d electronic information-handling methods. The\nimplication here is of the computer not merely as a data-handler, but as\na business organizer and planner as well.\n\n\n                        _Electronic Ticker Tape_\n\nThe stock market lends itself to the use of high-speed data-processing,\neven though a Wall Street man achieved notoriety some time back as the\nfirst embezzler to use computer techniques. Admittedly it is harder to\ntrack down the hand in the till when it pushes buttons and leaves no\ntelltale fingerprints or handwriting, but computerization continues\ndespite this possible drawback. The same firm has added digital\ncomputers to one of its offices for faster service. The American Stock\nExchange installed $3 million worth of new processing equipment to\nprovide instantaneous automatic reports on open, high, low, close, bid,\nasked, and volume-to-the-moment figures.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, representatives of\n    Thomson & McKinnon and IBM discuss a model of the computing system\n    which will speed transactions from the offices of the brokerage\n    houses in 41 cities to the New York and American stock exchanges.\n]\n\nThe stock market\u2019s need for the computer lies in the usual two factors:\ntremendous paperwork and increasing pressure for speed. Trading of stock\namounts to about three-fourths of a billion shares in a year, and\noccasionally 3 million shares a day change hands. A major brokerage\nhouse has confirmations to handle on thousands of trades, dividends to\ncredit to nearly half a million active accounts, and security position\nand cash balances to compute for each customer. The increasing amount of\nbusiness, plus the demand for more speed and accuracy, make the computer\nthe only solution.\n\nSimply reporting the results of the day\u2019s marketing in the newspapers is\na monumental task. The Associated Press is installing a system based on\nan IBM 1620 computer, in which ticker information will also be given in\nthe computer for sorting, comparison, tabulation, and storage. At the\ncorrect time, the machine will print out the format for publication in\nthe press at the rate of 4,500 words a minute. With a memory of 20\nmillion characters and a capacity for 600,000 logical decisions each\nminute, the computer keeps up with stock information practically as fast\nas it is received, and even a late ticker will not mean a missed\nnewspaper deadline. Associated Press expects to be able to transmit the\nstock-market results to its papers within fifteen seconds after the\nticker closes. Not just in the United States but in Japan as well, the\ncomputer is invading the stock market. The abacus is out, and now the\nexchange in Tokyo is using an advanced UNIVAC solid-state computer to\nprocess transactions.\n\n\n                         _Versatile Executive_\n\nIt is this high-volume capacity, speed, and accuracy that makes the\ncomputer a welcome new employee in most business operations. An example\nis the Johnson\u2019s Wax system linking its facilities for rapid management\nreaction to changing conditions. Headquarters is linked to twenty three\nwarehouses and sales offices, and today\u2019s work is based on yesterday\u2019s\ninventory instead of last month\u2019s.\n\nComputers schedule hotel reservations, and handle accounts payable and\nreceivable for the hotel industry. Auto-parking, now a $500 million a\nyear business, leans ever more heavily on computers for ticket-issuing,\ncar-counting, traffic direction, charge-figuring, and collection. The\nfreeway too has its computers, though there have been minor setbacks\nlike that on the New Jersey Turnpike where an automatic toll-card\ndispenser was mistaken by slow-thinking people for a collector and its\nworking was jammed with coins and battered by abuse when no change was\nforthcoming! Man will take some educating as the machine finds wider\nemployment.\n\nThe computer has been seen in the publishing business primarily as a\ntool for searching lists and printing addresses. Now it is beginning to\ntake over more important duties such as typesetting. The new daily\n_Arizona Journal_ is the first newspaper to make use of this technique.\n\nFrom use in other businesses, the computer has grown to fostering a\nbusiness of its own. An example is in the production of payroll checks\nby specialty firms, and safeguarding against bad checks with such\nservices as Telecredit, a computer-run system that spots bad checks upon\ninterrogation from its member stores.\n\nIn Waterbury, Connecticut, a computer helps home-buyers and realtors by\nlisting all available homes in the area. Three reports are produced: a\ntotal listing, a listing by style, and a listing by price. Bell\nTelephone in New York uses a computer system to deliver its 9 million\ndirectories to subscribers in the city and suburbs. The rapid system\npermits changing of delivery orders even while the books are at the\nprinters. A computer method of making sausage recipes is now available\nto all packers. Remington Rand developed this application at its UNIVAC\nCenter on the campus of Southern Methodist University.\n\n\n                            _Communication_\n\nCommunication is a vital part of all business, and the digital computer\nfinds another application here. A technique known as adaptive control\nwas recently presented at a symposium by scientists from IBM.\nSpecial-purpose computers integrated into communication networks would\nmake possible the \u201ctime-sharing\u201d of channels and cut costs per message\nsharply. Another digital computer, an inexpensive \u201cdecision threshold\u201d\ndevice, is being pushed as a means of reducing errors in the\ntransmission of messages. These logical uses of the computer were\npresaged in the 30\u2019s when Shannon wrote his pioneering circuit-logic\npaper, and in the late 40\u2019s with his work on information theory.\n\nTV Station KNXT in Los Angeles uses a digital computer to control the\ncomplicated switching necessary during station breaks. This electronic\njuggling of live shows, commercials, and network programming is called\nTASCON, for Television Automatic Sequence Control. It can be programmed\nhours before use, and then needs only the push of the button instead of\nfrantic manual switching that occasionally throws the human operator.\n\nNot just the mechanics of transmitting the commercials on TV, but even\nthe billing and other accounting functions are a major computer project.\nTo handle close to $700 million a year in payments, an IBM 7090 computer\nis being used. There are more than 5,000 TV stations in the country,\nwith billings dependent on a complicated structure of 180 different\nrates. As a result, there is an undesirable lag in payment. Putting\nrecords on tape and feeding them to the computer is expected to clear up\nthe trouble and provide a bonus in the form of advising stations on\ndiscount rates for programming on a current basis.\n\nThe computer isn\u2019t content with skirting the edges of the advertising\ngame, of course. A heated battle is going on now in this industry over\nthe growing use of the computer to plan campaigns and actually evaluate\nads, a task held by some to be the exclusive domain of the human adman\nwith his high creative ability. The Industrial Advertising Research\nInstitute triggered the fight by using a computer to study 1,130\nadvertisements appearing in the industrial journal _Machine Design_ and\nselect the best black-and-white and the best color ads.\n\nWhile diehards snorted ridicule, the computer made its choices. IARI\nthen compared its selections with those made by two of the largest and\nmost experienced rating firms. On color ads, the computer scored 66 per\ncent, rating two out of three ads practically the same as the human\nselectors. With black-and-white it did even better, scoring 71 per cent.\nIts detractors, assuming of course that the human raters were\ninfallible, gloated that the computer was a flop, that it could pick\nonly the average ads accurately and fell down on excellent and poor\nones.\n\nThe agency of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn thought otherwise and is\nusing the computer in its advertising. As a tool for media selection and\nscheduling, BBDO likened the computer to a power shovel instead of a\nspade. The new method makes it possible to compare thousands of\ncombinations a second. Another firm, the Simulmatics Corporation, agrees\nwith BBDO. The computer, it says, will permit advertising campaigns far\nmore effective than those waged at present, since the most efficient\ncampaign may be too complex to be devised without artificial aid. The\nkey to the Simulmatics system is the \u201cmedia mix model\u201d in which a\nhypothetical campaign can be tried out in advance in the computer.\n\nYoung & Rubicam differs hotly with computer advocates. A spokesman\nleveled a low blow at the computer, suggesting that it will have\ndifficulties forming motivational research based on Freudian analyses!\nThe firm says no way has yet been found to transpose \u201cViennese\nfatuities\u201d into Arabic numerals. It deplores the turning of a\nmedia-planner into a rubber stamp as media selection becomes an\nautomatic reiteration which \u201cthose with an abacus could pipe to a stale\nand sterile tune.\u201d The battle rages, but the outcome seems to be a\nforegone conclusion. Either the computer will sway Madison Avenue from\nViennese fatuities, or it will learn about sex.\n\n\n                               _Industry_\n\nWe have discussed the computer in business; perhaps it would be well to\nstress that this includes industry as well. The computer not only\nfunctions in the bank and brokerage house, insurance office, and\nsupermart, but also is found increasingly in jobs with oil refineries,\nchemical plants, surveying teams, knitting mills (a likely application\nwhen we remember Jacquard), and steel mills. As automation takes over\nfactories, it brings the computer with it to plan and operate the new\nproduction methods. Transportation too is making good use of the\ncomputer. Freight-handling in the United States, Canada, England, and\nthe U.S.S.R. is using machine techniques.\n\nOur high-speed airplanes are already more aimed than flown, and less and\nless seen and seen from. Mach-3 aircraft are on the drawing boards now,\naircraft that will fly at three times the speed of sound or about 2,000\nmiles per hour. An airliner taking off from London must already be\ncleared to land in New York. So authorities on both sides of the ocean\nare concerned. In England, giant computers like the Ferranti Apollo and\nothers are on order. There is talk in that country too of integrating\nmilitary and commercial aviation into one traffic control system. In the\nnext ten years the sky population may double again, in addition to\nflying faster, further crowding the airlanes and particularly the space\nadjacent to airports. The only solution to this aerial traffic jam lies\nin the electronic computer.\n\nNot as spectacular as air traffic control, but important nonetheless, is\nthe job of planning the route an airliner will fly. United Air Lines\nuses a Bendix G-15 to select flight plans for its big DC-8\u2019s. In a\nmanner similar to the NANWEP course-planning described for surface\nvessels, the computer examines a number of possible routes for the big\ntransports, considering distance flown, wind, temperature, weight and\nfuel requirements, and time schedules.\n\nThis flight-planning was originally done by manual computation and\nrequired an hour to work out details for only one possible flight plan.\nThe computer method was demanded because of the increased speed of the\nbig jets and their sensitivities to weather conditions en route. The\ncomputer examines a number of tentative plans in minutes and selects the\none which will make the optimum use of winds aloft, temperatures,\nweather, and so on. If weather changes en route require it, the pilot\ncan call the planning center no matter where he is and request that the\ncomputer work out a new flight plan.\n\nOnce the optimum flight plan has been figured, an electronic computer in\nthe aircraft itself may one day assure that the desired flight path is\nactually flown. The ASN-24 computer, developed by Librascope,\nIncorporated, and the Air Force, weighs only thirty-one pounds, yet\nperforms more than 20 million computation steps in a six-hour flight.\nThe electronic navigator, with information from Doppler equipment and\nother navigation aids, evaluates which is the best \u201cfix,\u201d weighing for\nexample the relative accuracies of a Loran fix and a dead-reckoning fix.\nThe computer even shoots celestial fixes and plots the results!\nObviously faster than its human monitor, the electronic navigation\ncomputer solves navigation problems with an error as small as one part\nin 32 million.\n\nA broader use of the computer in aircraft is proposed by the Convair\nDivision of General Dynamics. Because today\u2019s airplane is far more\ncomplicated than those ten years ago, and those ten years hence will\nextend this trend, the firm feels that checkout of the aircraft will\nrequire electronic computers. While adding about 3 per cent to the total\ncost of the plane, such equipment could perform a variety of functions\nincluding maintenance analysis and would add an hour a day to the\nprofit-making flight time.\n\nThere would be no profit for the airlines with the best flight planning\nand in-flight control in the world if there were no passengers aboard;\nthe \u201ctraffic problem\u201d extends from the sky to the ticket counter. For\nthis reason most airlines have already recruited the computer for\nanother important job\u2014that of ticket reservation clerk. An example,\nrecently installed by United Airlines, is the \u201cInstamatic,\u201d a giant,\nfar-flung system weighing 150 tons and requiring 12,000 miles of\ncircuits. Instamatic cost $16 million and can handle 540,000\nreservations in a single day. So complex is the computer system that it\nrequires 40,000 printed-circuit boards, 500,000 transistors, and\n2,000,000 ferrite memory cores. But it gets the job done, and any one of\n3,000 agents all over the country can confirm space on any flight,\nanytime, within seconds!\n\nThere are other systems used by competing lines, systems called Sabre,\nTeleflite, and so on. But Remington Rand UNIVAC has proposed an over-all\nsystem that will make any of them look like a child\u2019s do-it-yourself\nwalkie-talkie. The UNIVAC plan is for a single interline reservation\nsystem, used by all twenty-four domestic airlines. Called AID, for\nAirline Interline Development, the new scheme would cost the airlines\nonly 12 cents per message, and could be tied in with foreign carriers\nfor international bookings.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Remington Rand UNIVAC_\n\n  Console for airlines reservation system permits pushbutton booking of\n    space.\n]\n\nPresent methods of reservations among airlines require from less than a\nminute for easy bookings to several hours for the tough ones. The AID\nsystem uses a dial phone, with direct lines to a central computer in\nChicago. The response to the dialed request is an immediate voice\nanswer. If space is available, the computer also stores all the needed\ninformation for the reservation and transmits a teletype message to the\nboarding point of the proper airline.\n\nTo go back another step, the aircraft on which the computer confirms\nseat space was most likely built with the help of another computer. A\ntypical production system is that used by Lockheed in its Marietta,\nGeorgia, plant. There an IBM 305 RAMAC computer keeps track of 45,000\nparts orders continuously. The result is better and faster operation,\nand a saving to Lockheed of $3,500 a month. In California, Lockheed is\nusing a computerized data acquisition system called EDGE, for Electronic\nData Gathering Equipment, that feeds production information directly\ninto a computer memory for analysis and action orders. Remote reporting\nstations can be operated by production-line workers and will relay\nproduction data to the central computer. Although the Lockheed EDGE\nsystem will cost more than $600,000 a year, officials feel that it will\nsave the company three times that at the outset, and perhaps more when\nwider use is made of its potential. An interesting feature is the tying\ntogether of Lockheed\u2019s widely separated plants at Sunnyvale, Palmdale,\nand Van Nuys, California.\n\nNorth American Aviation links its complex of plants in the Los Angeles\narea by microwave, even bouncing beams of data from reflectors atop Oat\nMountain where there is no direct line-of-sight path between the\ndifferent locations. Douglas Aircraft maintains a data link between\nCalifornia and Charlotte, North Carolina, to permit use of computers\nover a distance of 2,400 miles.\n\nThe airlines are also using computer inventory systems to control their\nstock of spare parts. Material costs represent 60 per cent of airline\nrevenue and are rising; some larger carriers have investments of as much\nas $75 million in spare parts. It takes the computer to control the flow\nof repairable parts through the shop efficiently, schedule the removal\nof those requiring periodic checks, spot high-use items, and so on.\n\nAs an example of the complexity a large airline faces in its\nmaintenance, TWA stocks 8,000 different replaceable items. When such\nparts are needed, they must be on hand _where_ they are needed, but\noverstocking can lead to financial ruin. To match increasing\ncompetition, airlines find it necessary to resort to the laws of\nprobability and other sophisticated statistical techniques in stocking\nparts. Fed such equations, the computer can match ten to twelve\nman-years of work in three hours, and mean the difference between an\noversupply of parts in New York with outages in Los Angeles, and\nproperly balanced stocks.\n\nThe ramifications of the computer in the airplane industry are\nfar-reaching. For example, Boeing has recorded the lessons it learned on\nits Bomarc missile program in computers so that it can retain and apply\nthem on its Minuteman and Dyna-Soar programs. The computer will thus\nkeep track of men and their projects and warn them of previous mistakes.\nModern management techniques such as PERT and PEP, favored by the\ngovernment, make good use of the computer.\n\nThe McDonnell Aircraft Corporation is primarily a builder of planes and\nspace vehicles, but it has found itself in the computer business too as\na data-processing center. Installing computers for its own engineering\nand business uses, McDonnell soon began selling computer time in off\nhours to banks and other businesses. It now has a computer valuation of\nabout $10 million and operates around the clock.\n\n\n                        _The Designing Computer_\n\nIt seems strange that the computer was a bookkeeper and clerk for years\nbefore anyone seriously considered that it might be an engineer as well,\nyet the men who themselves designed the computer were loath to use it in\ntheir other work. Part of this resistance stems from the high premium\nplaced on the creativity of research and design work. The engineer uses\nscience in his work, to be sure, but he professes to use it as an\nartist, or with the personal touch of, say, a brewmaster. There is\nanother possible reason for the lag in computer use by the men who\nshould appreciate its ability the most. In the early days of the\ncomputer, it clacked away all week figuring payrolls, and perhaps\nwriting checks. That\u2019s what it was ordered for, and that\u2019s where the\nmoney was\u2014in the businessman\u2019s application of the computer.\n\nTo be sure, the military was using the computer for other purposes, but\nthe average scientist or engineer not employed by Uncle Sam had access\nto an electronic computer only on Sunday, if at all, when the big\nmachine had done its primary work and could take a breathing spell. To\nfurther compound excuses for the foot-dragging engineer, there was a\ndifference in needs in payroll computation and scientific mathematical\ncalculation. Commercial computers are designed for a high rate of input\nand output, with a relatively slow arithmetic going on inside. The\nengineer, on the other hand, might need only several minutes of computer\ntime, but it could take him a couple of days to put the problem into a\nform the machine could digest.\n\nSlowly, however, enough engineers fought the battle of translation and\nforewent Sunday pursuits like church, picnics, and golf to learn\nhaltingly how to use the electronic monster. It took courage, in\naddition to sacrifice, because the computer was pooh-poohed by some\nsharp scientific brains as an _idiot savant_ at best. Behind the inertia\nthere could have been a touch of concern too\u2014concern that the machine\njust might not be as stupid as everybody kept saying it was.\n\nHeavy industry made use of the machines. The steel plants, petroleum and\nchemical plants, and even the designers of highways were among the early\nusers of computer techniques. There was of course good reason for this\nphenomenon. Faced with problems involving many variables and requiring\nstatistical and probabilistic approaches, these people could make the\nbest use of machines designed for repetitive computations. The refiner\nwith a new plant in mind could simulate it in the computer and get an\nidea of how, or if, it would work before building his pilot plant. Today\nthe notion of dispensing with even the pilot plant is getting serious\nconsideration.\n\nOne program used by a gasoline producer analyzed thirty-seven variables\nand thirty-seven restrictions, a matrix that could never be evaluated by\nordinary methods. Textile fiber research is another example, with thread\ntests run on dozens of samples and averaged statistically for valid\nconclusions. B. F. Goodrich put the computer to work in its laboratories\nat such tasks as multiple-regression studies of past production of\nprocesses like polymerization and the running of a batch of new material\non the computer.\n\nThese applications were accomplishing a two-fold benefit. First, years\nwere being telescoped into weeks or even days; second, _complete_\ninvestigation rather than sketchy sampling was possible. Optimum\nsolutions took the place of the guesswork once necessary because of the\nlack of sufficient brainpower to run down all the possibilities. Still\nthere were scientists and designers in other fields who shook their\nheads loftily and said, \u201cNot for me, thanks.\u201d The computer was but a\ndiligent clerk, they held, relieving the engineer of some onerous\nchores. It could do nothing really creative; that must be left to man\nand his brain.\n\nBy now many industrial firms had purchased or rented computers for the\ntechnical people so that they would not have to fight for a place in\nline at the payroll computer. Civil engineering agencies, perhaps a\nhundred strong, used computers to design bridges and plan and lay out\nhighways. Designers at the Tudor Engineering Company of San Francisco\nput its Bendix G-15D to work planning the highway that Contra Costa\nCounty will need in 1980. Almost all of our fifty states now use\ncomputers in their highway departments. In 1960, Georgia solved more\nthan a thousand highway bridge design problems in its computers. Besides\ndoing the work faster and cheaper, the computer produces a safer\nproduct. For example, if substandard materials are programmed in, the\ncomputer will print out a warning or even stop working altogether so\nthat the error can be corrected.\n\nSteel companies, like Jones & Laughlin, use computers not only to run\nproduction mills, but also as research tools. Three hours of operation\nof a new furnace can be simulated in the computer in thirty seconds.\nTracing the steel back to its ore, the computer is used again. The\nBureau of Mines has used the machines for several years; they are\nhelpful in problems ranging from open-pit operation, grades of ore,\ndrill-core data logging, reserve calculations, and process control.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _General Electric Co., Computer Dept._\n\n  Computer operation of Jones & Laughlin steel mill.\n]\n\nGradually, then, the resistance was worn down. Grudgingly at first, and\naccepting the computer only as an assiduous moron, engineers in other\nfields put it to work. Complex machine operations like gear-shaping were\nplanned and carried out by computers that even punched out tapes for\ncontrolling the production tools. Optics designers switched from desk\ncalculators to electronic computers. Mechanical engineers in jobs from\nultrasonic vibrators to tractor design became users of computers. Mass\nspectrometry, heat-exchanger design, and waterworks design joined the\njobs the computer could do.\n\nThe computer had figured in plotting trajectories for missiles, and in\nthe production of aircraft; engineers found it could design them too.\nBack in 1945, an analysis of twenty-one different flight conditions at\neach of twelve stations of an airplane fuselage took 33 days and cost\nmore than $17,000. Today, by using a high-speed computer instead of a\ndesk calculator, the analysis is completed in a day and a half, at a\ncost of $200!\n\nThe last of the diehards seemed to be the electronics people themselves.\nA survey conducted by a technical journal in the field showed that in\n1960 many designers were not using computers in their work. Admitting\nthat the computer was a whiz just about everywhere else, the electronics\nengineer still could say, \u201cThe machine is great on paperwork, but I do\n_creative_ work. The computer can\u2019t help me.\u201d Other reasons were that\ncomputers were expensive, took much time to program, and were helpful\nonly with major design problems. Fortunately, all designers do not feel\nthat way, and progress is being made to put the computer to work in the\nelectronics field. It is helping in the design of components (Bendix\nsaves ten man-hours in computing a tenth-order polynomial and associated\ndata) and of networks (Lenkurt Electric saves close to 250 engineering\nhours a week in filter network design). Bell Telephone uses the computer\napproach in circuit analysis, and Westinghouse in the design of radar\ncircuitry. It is interesting that as we move up the design scale, closer\nto what the engineer once considered the domain of human creativity, the\ncomputer still is of great value. In systems design it is harder at the\noutset to pin down the saving in time and the improvement in the system\n(the latter is perhaps hard to admit!) but firms using computers report\nsavings in this field too.\n\nOne interesting job given the computer was that of designing the\nmagnetic ink characters to be used in its own \u201creading\u201d applications.\nThis project, conducted by Stanford Research Institute, is typical of\nthe questions we have begun to ask the computer about its needs and ways\nto improve it. A larger scale application of this idea is that of\nletting the computer design itself. Bell Telephone Laboratories\ndeveloped such a system, called BLADES, for Bell Laboratories Automatic\nDesign System, to design a computer used in the Nike-Zeus antimissile\ndefense system.\n\nA wag once noted that the computer would one day give birth to an\nelectronic baby. His prophecy came true perhaps quicker than he\nanticipated, but there is one basic difference in that the progeny is\nnot necessarily a smaller machine. The giant LARC, for instance, was\ndesigned by lesser computers. As A. M. Turing has pointed out, it is\ntheoretically possible for a simple computer to produce a more complex\none. This idea is borne out in nature, of course, and man is somewhat\nadvanced over the amoeba. Thus the implication in the computer-designed\ncomputer is far more than merely the time and money saved, although this\nwas certainly a considerable amount. The BLADES system in twenty-five\nminutes produced information for building a subassembly, a job that\nrequired four weeks of manual computation.\n\nNotable improvements in the general-purpose computer are doing much to\nfurther its use as a technical tool. Present machines do jobs as varied\nas the following: personnel records, inventorying, pattern\ndetermination, missile system checkout, power-plant control, system\nsimulation, navigation, ballistic trajectory computations, and so on.\nSpecial computers are also provided now for the engineer; and among\nthese is the Stromberg-Carlson S-C 4020 microfilm recorder. Engineering\nspecifications are put into the computer and the machine can then\nproduce on request mechanical drawings as required by the engineer. Data\nstored in the memory is displayed on a Charactron tube. There is little\nresistance to this type of computer, since the engineer can say it is\ndoing work below his level of ability! Of course, the draftsman may take\na dim view of computers that can do mechanical drawing.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Bell Telephone Laboratories_\n\n  Engineer checks design information for first computer built from\n    complete information furnished by another computer. Shown is a\n    subassembly of the computer, which will be used in the Army\u2019s\n    Nike-Zeus antimissile defense system.\n]\n\nAfter a rather hard to explain slow start, then, the computer is now\nwell established as a scientific and engineering tool. Blue-sky schemes\ndescribe systems in which the engineer simply discusses his problem with\nthe machine, giving specifications and the desired piece of equipment.\nThe machine talks back, rejecting certain proposed inputs and suggesting\nalternatives, and finally comes up with the finished design for the\nengineer\u2019s approval. If he laughs overly loud at this possibility, the\nengineer may be trying to cover up his real feelings. At any rate the\ncomputer has added a thinking cap to its wardrobe of eyeshade and work\ngloves.\n\n\n                            _Digital Doctor_\n\nMedical electronics is a fairly well-known new field of science, but the\npart being played in medicine by the computer is surprising to those of\nus not close to this work. Indicative of the use of the computer by\nmedical scientists is a study of infant death rates being conducted by\nthe American Medical Research Foundation. Under the direction of Dr.\nSydney Kane, this research uses a UNIVAC computer and in 1961 had\nalready processed information on 50,000 births in ninety participating\nhospitals. Punched-card data include the mother\u2019s age, maternal\ncomplications, type of delivery, anesthetics used, and other pertinent\ninformation. Dr. Kane believes that analysis by the computer of this\ninformation may determine causes of deaths, after-birth pathological\nconditions, and incapacity of babies to reach viability. A reduction in\ninfant mortality of perhaps 12,000 to 14,000 annually is believed\npossible as a result of the studies.\n\nAnother killer of mankind, cancer, is being battled by the computer.\nResearchers at the University of Philadelphia, supported in part by the\nAmerican Cancer Society, are programming electronic computers to act as\ncancer cells! The complexity of the problem is seen in the fact that\nseveral man-years of work and 500 hours of computer programming have\nbarely scratched the surface of the problem. A third of a million\nmolecules make up the genes in a human cell, and the actions of these\ntiny components take place many times faster than even the high-speed\ncomputer can operate. Despite the problems, some answers to tough\nchemical questions about the cancer cells are being found by using the\ncomputer, which is of course thousands of times faster than manual\ncomputation.\n\nIf you were discharged from a hospital in 1962, there is a chance that\nyour records are being analyzed by a computer at Ann Arbor, Michigan as\npart of the work of the Commission on Professional and Hospital\nActivity. Information on 2-1/2 million patients from thirty-four states\nwill be processed by a Honeywell 400 computer to evaluate diagnostic and\nhospital care and to compare the performance of the various\ninstitutions.\n\nIn the first phase of a computerized medical literature analysis and\nretrieval system for the National Library of Medicine, the U.S. Public\nHealth Service contracted with General Electric for a system called\nMEDLARS, MEDical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System. MEDLARS will\nprocess several hundred thousand pieces of medical information each\nyear. New York University\u2019s College of Engineering has formed a\nbiomedical computing section to provide computer service for medical\nresearchers. Using an IBM 650 and a Control Data Corporation 1604, the\ncomputer section has already done important work, including prediction\nof coronary diseases in men under forty.\n\nThe success of computers in these small-scale applications to the\nproblems of medicine has prompted the urging of a national biomedical\ncomputer system. It is estimated that as yet only about 5 per cent of\nmedical research projects are using computer techniques, but that within\nten years the figure will jump to between 50 and 75 per cent.\n\nAn intriguing possibility is the use of the computer as a diagnostic\ntool. Small office machines, costing perhaps only $50, have been\nsuggested, not by quacks or science-fiction writers, but by scientists\nlike Vladimir Zworykin of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research.\nZworykin is the man who fathered the iconoscope and kinescope that made\ntelevision possible. The simple diagnostic computer he proposes would\nuse information compiled by a large electronic computer which might\neventually catalog the symptoms of as many as 10,000 diseases. Using an\nRCA 501 computer, a pilot project of this technique has already gathered\nsymptoms of 100 hematological diseases.\n\nAnother use of the computer is in the HIPO system. Despite its\nfrightening acronymic name, this is merely a plan for the automated\ndispensing of the right medicine at the right time to the right patient,\nthus speeding recoveries and preventing the occasional tragic results of\nwrong dosage. More exotic is a computer called the Heikolator which is\ndesigned to substitute for the human brain in transmitting messages to\nparalyzed limbs that could otherwise not function.\n\nThe simulation of body parts by the computer for study is already taking\nplace. Some researchers treat the flow of blood through arteries as\nsimilar to the flow of water through a rubber tube, analyze these\nphysical actions, and use them in computer simulation of the human\nsystem. The Air Force uses a computer to simulate the physical chemistry\nof the entire respiratory and circulatory systems, a task that keeps\ntrack of no less than fifty-three interdependent variables.\n\nDr. Kinsey of the Kresge Eye Institute in Detroit is directing computer\nwork concerning the physiology of the eye. According to Kinsey it was\nimpossible previously to approximate the actual composition of cell\nsubstances secreted from the blood into the eye. Even those whose eyes\nno longer serve them are being benefited by computer research. The\nBattelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, uses an IBM computer to\ndevelop reading devices for the blind. These complicated readers use a\ndigital computer to convert patterns of printed letters into musical\ntones. Further sophistication could lead to an output of verbalized\nwords. Interestingly, it is thought that the research will also yield\napplications of use in banking, postal service, and other commercial\nfields.\n\nRussia is also aware of the importance of the computer in the medical\nfield. A neurophysiologist reported after a trip to Russia that the\nSoviet Union is training its brightest medical students in the use of\nthe computer. Such a philosophy is agreed to by medical spokesmen in\nthis country who state that no other field can make better use of the\ncomputer\u2019s abilities. Among advanced Russian work with computers in the\nbiomedical field is a study of the effects on human perception of\nchanges in sound and color.\n\nVisionary ideas like those of radio transmitters implanted in patients\nto beam messages to a central computer for continuous monitoring and\ndiagnosis are beginning to take on the appearance of distinct\npossibilities. Some are beginning to wonder if after it has learned a\ngood bedside manner, the computer may even ask for a scalpel and a TV\nseries.\n\n\n                                _Music_\n\nThe computer has proved itself qualified in a number of fields and\nprofessions, but what of the more artistic ones? Not long ago RCA\ndemonstrated an electronic computer as an aid to the musical composer.\nBased on random probability, this machine is no tongue-in-cheek gadget\nbut has already produced its own compositions based on the style of\nStephen Foster. Instead of throwing up their hands in shocked horror,\nmodern composers like Aaron Copland welcome the music \u201csynthesizer\u201d with\nopen arms. Bemoaning only the price of such a computer\u2014about\n$150,000\u2014Copland looks to the day when the composer will feed in a few\nrough ideas and have the machine produce a fully orchestrated piece. The\norchestration, incidentally, will include sounds no present instruments\ncan produce. \u201cImagine what will happen when every combination of\neighty-eight keys is played,\u201d Copland suggests. Many traditionalists\nprofess to shudder at the thought of a machine producing music, but\nmathematical compositions are no novelty. Even random music was\n\u201ccomposed\u201d by Mozart, whose \u201cA Musical Dice Game\u201d is chance music with a\nparticularly descriptive title, and Dr. John Pierce of Bell Laboratories\nhas extended such work.\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Taken from \u201c_Illiac Suite_,\u201d by L. A. Hiller\n    and L. M. Isaacson, copyrighted 1957, by\n    _Theodore Presser Co._ Used by permission.\n\n  Random chromatic music produced by ILLIAC computer\n  resembles the compositions of some extreme modern composers.\n]\n\n\nIn 1955, Lejaren A. Hiller, Jr., and L. M. Isaacson began to program the\nILLIAC computer at the University of Illinois to compose music. The\ncomputer actually published its work, including \u201cIlliac Suite for String\nQuartet,\u201d Copyright 1957, New Music Editions, done in the style of\nPalestrina. All music lies somewhere between the complete randomness of,\nsay, the hissing of electrons in vacuum tubes and the orderliness of a\nsustained tone. No less a master than Stravinsky has called composition\n\u201cthe great technique of selection,\u201d and the computer can be taught to\nselect in about any degree we desire. Hiller describes the process, in\nwhich the machine is given fourteen notes representing two octaves of\nthe C-major scale, and restricted to \u201cfirst-species counterpoint.\u201d By\nmeans of this screening technique, the computer \u201ccomposed\u201d by a\ntrial-and-error procedure that may be analogous to that of the human\nmusician. Each note was examined against the criteria assigned; if it\npassed, it was stored in memory; if not, another was tried. If after\nfifty trials no right note was found, the \u201ccomposition\u201d was abandoned,\nmuch as might be done by a human composer who has written himself into a\ncorner, and a new start was made. In an hour of such work, ILLIAC\nproduced several hundred short melodies\u2014a gold mine for a Tin Pan Alley\ntunesmith! It was then told to produce two-voice counterpoint for the\nbasic melodies. \u201cIlliac Suite\u201d is compared, by its programmers at least,\nwith the modern music of Bartok.\n\nPurists whose sensibilities are offended by the very notion of computer\nmusic point out that music is subjective\u2014a means of conveying emotion\nfrom the heart of the composer to that of the listener. Be that as it\nmay, the composition itself is objective and can be rigorously analyzed\nmathematically, before or after the fact. From a technical standpoint\nthere seems to be only one question about this new music\u2014who composed\nit, the programmer or the computer?\n\nAn interesting sidelight to computer music is its use to test the\nacoustics of as yet unbuilt auditoriums. Bell Telephone Laboratories has\ndevised such a machine in its Acoustical and Visual Research Department.\nThe specifications of the new auditorium are fed into the computer,\nfollowed by music recorded on tape. The computer\u2019s output is then this\nmusic as it will sound in the new hall. Critical experts listen and\ndecide if the auditorium acoustics are all right, or if some redesign is\nin order.\n\n\n                         _The Machine at Play_\n\nThe computer\u2019s game-playing ability in chess and other games has been\ndescribed. It is getting into the act in other fields, spectator sports\nas well. Baseball calls on the computer to plan season strategy and\npredict winners. When Roger Maris began his home-run string, an IBM 1401\npredicted that he had 55 chances in 100 of beating Ruth\u2019s record.\nWorkers at M.I.T. have developed a computer program that answers\nquestions like \u201cDid the Red Sox ever win six games in a row?\u201d and \u201cDid\nevery American League team play at least once in each park in every\nmonth?\u201d\n\nAn IBM RAMAC computer is handling the management of New York\u2019s Aqueduct\nrace track, and promises to do a better job than the human bosses, thus\nsaving money for the owners and the State of New York Tax Commission.\nThe Fifteenth Annual Powderpuff Derby, the all-women transcontinental\nair race, was scored by a Royal Precision LGP-30 computer, and sports\ncar enthusiasts have built their own \u201crally\u201d computers to gauge their\nprogress. The Winter Olympics at Innsbruck, Austria, will be scored by\nIBM\u2019s RAMAC, and even bowling gets an assist from the computer in the\nform of a scoring device added to the automatic pin-setter, bad news to\nscorekeepers who fudge to boost their points.\n\nAn IBM 704 has proved a handy tool for blackjack players with a system\nfor winning 99 per cent of the time, and rumor has it that a Los Angeles\nmanufacturer plans to market a computer weighing only two pounds and\ncosting $5, for horse-players.\n\nShowing that the computer can be programmed with tact is the\ndemonstrator that answers a man\u2019s age correctly if he answers ten\nquestions but announces only that a woman is over twenty-one. Proof that\nthe computer has invaded just about every occupation there is comes to\nlight in the news that a Frankfurt travel agency uses a computer called\nZuse L23 as an agent. The traveler simply fills out a six-question form,\nand in a few seconds Zuse picks the ideal vacation from a choice of 500.\nComputers, it seems, are already telling us where to go.\n\n\n                           _Business Outlook_\n\nThe computer revolution promises to reach clear to the top of the\nbusiness structure, rather than find its level somewhere in middle\nmanagement. The book, _Management Games_ lists more than 30,000 business\nexecutives who have taken part in electronic computer management \u201cgames\u201d\nin some hundred different versions. The first widely used such game was\ndeveloped in 1956 by the American Management Association. While such\ngames are for educational purposes, their logical extension is the\nactual conduct of business by a programmed computer.\n\nIn his book, _Industrial Dynamics_, Dr. J. W. Forrester points out that\na high-speed digital computer can be used in analyzing as many as 2,000\nvariables such as costs, wages, sales, and employment. This is obviously\nso far beyond human capability that the advantage of computer analysis\nbecomes evident. A corollary benefit is the speed inherent in the\ncomputer which makes it possible to test a new policy or manufacturing\nprogram in hours right in the computer, rather than waiting for months\nor years of actual implementation and possible failure. For these\nreasons another expert has predicted that most businesses will be using\ncomputer simulations of their organizations by 1966. Regardless of the\ntimetable, it is clear that the computer has jumped into business with\nboth its binary digits and will become an increasingly powerful factor.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Lichty, \u00a9 _Field Enterprises, Inc._\n\n  \u201cOur new \u2018brain\u2019 recognizes the human factor, doctor!... After feeding\n    it the symptoms, it gives the diagnosis and treatment.... But YOU\n    set the fee!\u201d\n]\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\u201c_Men have become the tools of their tools._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014Thoreau\n\n\n\n\n                     9: The Computer and Automation\n\n\nIn his movie, _City Lights_, Charlie Chaplin long ago portrayed the\nterrible plight of the workman in the modern factory. Now that the\nmachine is about to take over completely and relieve man of this\nmachinelike existence, it is perhaps time for Charlie to make another\nmovie pointing up this new injustice of civilization or machine\u2019s\ninhumanity to man. It seems to be damned if it does and damned if it\ndoesn\u2019t.\n\nFor some strange reason, few of us become alarmed at the news of a\ncomputer solving complex mathematics, translating a book, or processing\nmillions of checks daily, but the idea of a computer controlling a\nfactory stimulates union reprisals, editorials in the press against\nautomation, and much general breast-beating and soul-searching.\nPerversely we do not seem to mind the computer\u2019s thinking as much as we\ndo its overt action.\n\nIt is well to keep sight of the fact that automation is no new\nrevolution, but the latest development in the garden variety of\nindustrial revolution that began a couple of centuries ago in England:\n\nMechanization was the first step in that revolution, mechanization being\nthe application of power to supplement the muscles of men. Mass\nproduction came along as the second step at the turn of this century. It\nwas simply an organization of mechanized production for faster, more\nefficient output.\n\nAutomation is the latest logical extension of the two earlier steps,\nmade possible by rapid information handling and control. Recent layoffs\nin industry triggered demonstrations, including television programs,\nthat would indicate we suspect automation of having a rather cold heart.\nThe computer is the heart of automation.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Remington Rand UNIVAC_\n\n  Control operations require \u201creal-time\u201d computers that perform\n    calculations and make necessary decisions practically\n    instantaneously.\n]\n\nNone of these steps is as clear-cut or separate as it may seem without\nsome digging into history and an analysis of what we find. For example,\nwhile we generally consider that the loom was simply mechanized during\nthe dawn of industrial revolution, the seeds of computer control were\nsown by Jacquard with punched-card programming of the needles in his\nloom. Neither is it sufficient to say that the present spectacle of\nautomated pushbutton machines producing many commodities is no different\nfrom the introduction of mass-produced tractors. Tractors, after all,\ndisplaced horses; the computer-controlled factory is displacing men who\ndon\u2019t always want to be put out to pasture.\n\nAutomation is radically changing our lives. It is to be hoped that\nintelligent and humane planning will facilitate an orderly adjustment to\nthis change. Certainly workers now toil in safer and pleasanter\nsurroundings. It is reported that smashed toes and feet, hernia, eye\ntrouble, and similar occupational accidents have all but disappeared in\nautomated automobile plants. Unfortunately other occupational hazards\nare reportedly taking the place of these, and the psychological trauma\ninduced by removal of direct contact with his craft has given more than\none worker stomach ulcers. Let us investigate this transfer of contact\nfrom man to computer-controlled machine.\n\nA paper presented at the First Congress of the International Federation\nof Automatic Control, held in Moscow in 1960, uses as its introductory\nsentence, \u201cAutomatic control always involves computing.\u201d The writer then\npoints out that historically the computing device was analog in nature\nand tied so closely with the measuring and control elements as to be\nindistinguishable as an actual computer. In more recent history,\nhowever, the trend has been to separate the computer. With this trend is\nanother important change, that of using the digital computer in\nautomatic control.\n\nOne of the first papers to describe this separate computer function is\n\u201cInstrument Engineering, Its Growth and Its Promise,\u201d by Brown,\nCampbell, and Marcy, published in 1949. \u201cNaturally,\u201d the authors state,\n\u201ca computer will be used to control the process.\u201d Not a shop foreman or\nan engineer, but a computer. Watt\u2019s \u201cflyball\u201d governor pioneered the\nfield; more recent and more obvious examples of control by computers\ninclude ships guided by \u201cIron Mike\u201d and airplanes flown by the automatic\npilot. These were analog devices, and the first use of a digital\ncomputer as a control was in 1952, quite recently in our history. This\nairborne digital control computer was built by Hughes and was called\n\u201cDigitac.\u201d\n\nSince most industries have been in existence for many years, far\nantedating aviation, electronics, and the modern computer, the general\nincorporation of such control has been difficult both because of the\nphysical problem of altering existing machines and the mental phenomenon\nof inertia. Factory management understandably is slow to adopt a\nrevolutionary technique, and most control systems now in use in industry\nare still analog in nature. However, where new plants are built from the\nground up for computer control, the results are impressive. Designed by\nUnited Engineering, the Great Lakes 80-inch hot strip mill automatically\nprocesses 25-ton slabs of steel. More than 1,000 variables are\ncontrolled, and 200 analog signals and 100 digital computer-generated\nsignals are used in the process. The steel sheets are shot out of the\nrolls at some 45 miles an hour, or about 66 feet a second! A human\nsupervisor would have a difficult job just watching the several hundred\nsignals related to thickness, temperature, quality, and so on, much less\ntrying to think what to do if he noticed something out of\nspecifications. This would be roughly analogous to an editor trying to\nproofread a newspaper as it flashes by on the press and making\ncorrections back in the linotype room before any typographical errors\nwere printed. The new computer-controlled mill has an output of about\n450,000 tons a month, twice that of the next largest in operation.\n\nAmerican control experts who attended the Moscow conference brought back\nthe information that Russian effort in computer control is greater than\nthat in the United States, and that the Russians are more aware of what\nwe are doing in the field than we are of their progress. Their\nimplementation of modern computer control may be made easier because\ntheir industries are newer and do not represent such a long-established\nand expensive investment in hard-to-modify existing equipment.\n\nBasically, at least, computer control is simple and can be compared to\nthe feedback principle that describes many physical systems including\nthe workings of our own bodies. In practice, the computer can be put in\ncharge of producing something, and by sampling the output of its work\ncan constantly make corrections or improvements that are desired. This\nis of course an extreme simplification, and the control engineer speaks\nof \u201con-line\u201d operation, of adaptive systems that adjust to a changing\nenvironment, of predictive control, and so on. One vital requirement of\nthe computer involved in a control process, obviously, is that it cannot\ntake its time about its computations. The control computer is definitely\noperating \u201con the line\u201d; that is, in real time, or perhaps even looking\nahead by a certain amount so that it can not only keep up with\nproduction but also predict forthcoming changes and make corrections in\ntime to be of use.\n\nThe human process controller is stuck with methods like those of the\ncook who mixes up his recipe with a spoonful of this, and three pinches\nof that, sniffs or tastes the batter subjectively, and may end up with a\nmasterpiece or a flop. Computer control processes the same batter\nthrough the pipes at a thousand gallons a minute and catches\ninfinitesimal variations in time to correct them before the hotcakes are\nbaked. In effect it makes hindsight into foresight by compressing time\nfar more than man could hope to do.\n\nEarly applications of the computer in industrial processes were simply\nthose of data \u201cloggers,\u201d or monitors. It was still up to the human\noperator to interpret what the computer observed and recorded, and to\nthrow the switch, close the valve, or push the panic button as the case\ndemanded. Actual computer control, the \u201cclosing of the loop\u201d as the\nengineers call it, is the logical next step. This replaces the human\noperator, or at least relegates him to the role of monitor.\n\nThe Great Lakes hot-rolling steel mill has been mentioned as an example\nof complete computer control. In Hayange, France, the first European\ncompletely automated steel-beam mill is slated to go into operation late\nin 1962. The Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation in this country uses a\ndigital computer system to control continuous annealing in its\nAliquippa, Pennsylvania, plant, and is evaluating an RCA\ncomputer-controlled tin-plating line operating at 3,000 feet a minute.\nNewer computer-control applications in the offing include sintering and\nother metal production operations.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Minneapolis-Honeywell_\n\n  Boston ice cream makers, H. P. Hood & Sons, use computer to make\n    pushbutton ice cream. Analog computer thinks out recipes, punches\n    them on cards to operate valves.\n]\n\nTo those of us who consume it, ice cream may not seem a likely candidate\nfor computer control. However, the firm of H. P. Hood & Sons uses\ncomputer control in its blending operation, finding it 20,000 times as\nfast, and more accurate than when handled by human operators, since\ncomputer controls hold mixes within one-tenth of 1 per cent accuracy.\nAutomation is a significant breakthrough in this industry, whose history\ngoes back 110 years, and in baking, which is a little older. The Sara\nLee bakeries use the computer too in assembling the ingredients for\ntheir goodies. To bake such cakes, Mother will have to get herself a\ncomputer.\n\nMinneapolis-Honeywell furnished the computer for the ice-cream control;\nthis same company delivered a system for the Celanese Corporation of\nAmerica\u2019s multimillion dollar acetyl manufacturing plant at Bay City,\nTexas. The new plant produces a petrochemical used in plastics, paint,\nsynthetic rubber, dye, fibers, and other products. Going \u201con-stream\u201d in\n1962, the Celanese plant will produce half a billion pounds of chemicals\nannually.\n\nRussia has been mentioned as active in industrial computer control. A\ncase in point is the soda plant at Slavyansk in the Donets Basin, which\nwas recently test-operated for a continuous period of 48 hours by\ncomputer. An unusual feature of this test was that the computer was in\nKiev, almost 400 miles away. A wire link between the two cities\npermitted monitoring and control of the plant from Kiev in what the\nRussians claim as the first remote automatic operation of such a plant.\n\nOther Soviet achievements include two large-scale automatically\ncontrolled installations. In oil-field operation at Tataria, gas and oil\noutputs from many wells are monitored and controlled from a central\nstation, dropping the work force required from 600 to 100. The other\ninstallation controls irrigation servicing 9,000 acres. A desktop\ncontrol handles the pumping of water from the Syr Darya River through\nunderground pipes, and distribution to Uzbekistan cotton fields. The\nRussians have also designed an automatic distillation unit for the\nHungarians. With an annual capacity of a million tons, the unit was\ninstalled in the large Szoeny refinery and scheduled for operation by\n1962.\n\nRefineries in the United States are also employing automatic controls in\ntheir operations. Phillips Petroleum installed a digital computer\ncontrol system in its Sweeney, Texas, plant to achieve maximum\nefficiency in its thermal cracking process. In the first step of an\nexperimental program, Phillips, working with Autonetics computer\nengineers, used a digital computer to plan optimum furnace operation. An\ninitial 10 per cent improvement was achieved in this way, and a further\n6 per cent gain resulted when a digital computer was installed on-line\nto operate the cracking furnace.\n\nThe Standard Oil Company of California is using an IBM 7090 in San\nFrancisco to control its catalytic or \u201ccat\u201d cracking plant in El\nSegundo, some 450 miles away. The need for computer speed and accuracy\nis shown by the conditions under which the cracking plant must operate\ncontinuously with no shutdowns except for repair. Each day, two million\ngallons of petroleum is mixed in the cracker with the catalyst, a\nmetallic clay. The mixing takes place at incandescent heat of 1,000\u00b0 F.,\nand the resulting inferno faces operators with more than a hundred\nchanging factors to keep track of, a job feasible only with computer\nhelp.\n\nAnother use of computer control in the petroleum industry is that of\nautomatic gasoline blending, as done by the Gulf Oil Corporation. A\ncompletely electronic system is in operation at Santa Fe Springs,\nCalifornia. The system automatically delivers the prescribed quantities\nof gasoline for the desired blend. In case of error or malfunction of\nequipment, the control alerts the human supervisor with warning lights\nand an audible alarm. If he does not take proper action the control\nsystem automatically shuts itself off.\n\nFrom the time the war-inspired industry of synthetic rubber production\nbegan in 1940 until very recently, it has been almost entirely a manual\noperation. Then in 1961 Goodyear Tire & Rubber introduced computer\ncontrol into the process at its Plioflex plant in Houston, Texas.\nGoodyear expects the new system to increase its \u201cthroughput\u201d and also to\nimprove the quality of the product through tighter, smoother control of\nthe complicated operation. Other chemical processors using computer\ncontrol in their plants include Dow Chemical, DuPont, Monsanto, Union\nCarbide, Sun Oil, and The Texas Company.\n\nAdept at controlling the flow of material through pipes, the computer\ncan also control the flow of electricity through wires. An example of\nthis application is the use of digital computers in electric-utility\nload-control stations. A typical installation is that of the\nPhiladelphia Electric Company in Philadelphia, the first to be\ninstalled. Serving 3-1/2 million customers, the utility relies on a\nMinneapolis-Honeywell computer to control automatically and continuously\nthe big turbine generators that supply electric power for the large\nindustrial area. The memory of the computer stores data about the\ngenerators, transmission-line losses, operating costs, and so on.\nBesides controlling the production of power for most economy, the\ncomputer in its spare time performs billing operations for exchange of\npower carried on with Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection\nand Delaware Power & Light Company and Atlantic City Electric Company.\n\nOther utilities using computer control are the Riverside Power Station\nof the Gulf States Utilities Company, Southern California Edison, and\nthe Louisiana Power & Light Company\u2019s Little Gypsy station in New\nOrleans.\n\nAnother industry that makes use of a continuous flow of material is now\nbeing fitted for computer control, and as a result papermakers may soon\nhave a better product to sell. IBM has delivered a 1710 computer to\nPotlach Forests, Inc., in Idaho for control of a paperboard machine 500\nfeet long. Papermaking up to now has been more art than science because\nof the difficulty of controlling recipes. With the computer, Potlach\nexpects to make better paper, have less reject material, and spend less\ntime in changing from one product run to another.\n\nShowing that automatic control can work just about anywhere, the English\nfirm of Cliffe Hill Granite Company in Markfield, Leicestershire,\ncontrols its grading and batching of granite aggregate from a central\nlocation. Besides rock-crushers, cement plants like Riverside Cement\nCompany use computer control in the United States.\n\nThus far most of the computer control operations we have discussed are\nin the continuous-processing fields of chemicals or other uniform\nmaterials. The computer is making headway in the machine shop too,\nalthough its work is less likely of notice there since the control panel\nis less impressive than the large machine tool it is directing. Aptly\ncalled APT, for Automatically Programmed Tools, the new technique is the\nbrainchild of M.I.T. engineer Douglas Ross. Automatic control eliminates\nthe need for drill jigs and other special setup tools and results in\ncheaper, faster, and more accurate machine work.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  Controlled by instructions generated by IBM\u2019s AUTOPROMPT, a Pratt &\n    Whitney Numeric-Keller continuous-path milling machine shapes a raw\n    aluminum block (upper left) into the saddle-shaped piece shown at\n    right. The surface is a portion of a geometric shape called a\n    hyperbolic paraboloid.\n]\n\nA coded tape, generated by a computer, controls the milling machine,\ndrill press, or shaper more accurately than the human machinist could.\nIn effect, the computer studies a blueprint and punches out instructions\non tape that tell the machine what it is to do, how much of it, and for\nhow long. Huge shaping and contouring machines munch chunks of metal\nfrom blanks to form them into complex three-dimensional shapes.\nRemington Rand UNIVAC and IBM are among the companies producing\ncomputers for this purpose. The trend is to simpler, more flexible\ncontrol so that even small shops can avail themselves of the new\ntechnique. In a typical example of the savings possible with \u201cnumerical\u201d\ntape control, these were the comparative costs:\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Control Engineering_\n\n  Operation of computer-controlled freight yard in England.\n]\n\n                                _Conventional_      _Tape\n                                             Control_\n\n                   Tooling            $755        $45\n\n                   Setup time      15 min.    15 min.\n\n                   Work time       15 min.    11 min.\n\n                   Cost per          $2.96      $1.81\n                   part\n\nBeyond the automated single- or multipurpose tool is the completely\ncomputer-controlled assembly line. Complete automation of products like\nautomobiles may be some distance off, but there is nothing basically\nunworkable about the idea. Simpler things will be made first, and to\npromote thinking along these lines, Westinghouse set up an automatic\nassembly line for paperweights. An operator typed the initials of\nmanufacturing department managers on a computer, which transferred the\ninstructions to a milling machine. The machine cut the initials in\naluminum blocks which were then automatically finished, painted, and\npackaged for shipment as completed paperweights.\n\nAnother firm, Daystrom, Inc., is designing a computer control system for\nassembly lines which will adjust itself for the \u201cbest\u201d product as an\noutput. President Tom Jones described the principle in which the\ncomputer will begin production, then move valves, switches, or other\ncontrols a small amount. Measuring the finished product, it will decide\nif the change is in the right direction, and proceed accordingly. Once\nit finds the optimum point, it will lock in this position and settle\ndown to business.\n\nAn excellent example of the computerized assembly line is the Western\nElectric Company carbon resistor production line at its Winston-Salem\nplant. A digital computer with a 4,096-word memory is used for the\nprogramming, setup, and feedback control of the eleven-station line. It\ncan accept a month\u2019s scheduling requirements for deposited carbon\nhigh-quality resistors in four power ratings and almost any desired\nresistance values. Production rate is 1,200 units per hour.\n\nThe computer keeps track of the resistors as they are fabricated,\nrejecting those out of specification and adjusting the process controls\nas necessary. Operations include heating, deposition of carbon, contact\nsputtering, welding, grooving, and inspecting.\n\n\n                              _The Robots_\n\nMost of these automated factory operations are doing men\u2019s work, but it\nis only when we see the robot in the shape of ourselves that cold chills\ninvade our spines. Children\u2019s Christmas toys lately have included\nmechanical men who stride or roll across the floor and speak, act, and\neven \u201cthink\u201d in more or less humanoid fashion, some of them hurling\nweapons in a rather frightening manner. There is an industrial robot in\noperation today which may recall the dread of Frankenstein, though its\nmost worried watchers are perhaps union officials. Called Unimate, this\nfactory worker has a single arm equipped with wrist and hand. It can\nmove horizontally through 220 degrees, and vertically for 60 degrees,\nand extend its arm from 3 feet to 7 feet at the rate of 2-1/2 feet a\nsecond. Without a stepladder, it can reach from the floor to a point\nnearly 9 feet above it. Unimate can pick up 75 pounds, and its 4-inch\nfingers can clamp together on an iron bar or a tool with a force of up\nto 300 pounds.\n\nThe robot weighs close to a ton and a half, but can be moved from job to\njob on a fork-lift truck. Its designers have turned up a hundred\ndifferent jobs that Unimate could do, including material loading,\npackaging, welding, spray painting, assembly work, and so on. The robot\nhas a memory and can retain the 16,000 \u201cbits\u201d of information necessary\nfor 200 operations. To teach it a new task, it is only necessary to\n\u201chelp\u201d it manually through each step one time. Unimate can be instructed\nto wait for an external signal during its task, such as the opening of a\npress or a furnace door.\n\nAdvantages of a robot are many and obvious. Pretty girls passing by will\nnot distract it, nor will it require time for lunch or coffee breaks, or\ntrips to the washroom. If necessary it will work around the clock\nwithout asking for double power for overtime. High temperatures, noxious\ngases, flying sparks, or dangerous liquids will not be a severe hazard,\nand Unimate never gets tired or forgets what it is doing.\n\nBut Unimate has some drawbacks that are just as obvious. It can\u2019t tell\none color from another, and thus might paint parts the wrong color and\nnever know the difference. It is not readily movable, and not very\nflexible either. It costs $25,000, and will need about $1,300 in\nmaintenance a year. Some industry spokesmen say that this is far too\nmuch, and Unimate has a long way to go before it puts any people out of\nwork. Others say it is a step in the right direction, and this is\nprobably a fair evaluation.\n\nApparently United States Industries, Inc., whose AutoTutor teaching\nmachines are pacing the field, has made another step in the right\ndirection with its \u201cTransfeRobot 200.\u201d This mechanical assembly-line\nworker is an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d item, and currently in use by about fifty\nmanufacturers. TransfeRobot uses its own electronic brain, coupled with\na variety of magnetic, mechanical, or even pneumatic fingers to pick up,\nposition, insert, remove, and do other necessary operations on small\nparts.\n\nBesides these capabilities, TransfeRobot controls secondary operations\nsuch as drilling, embossing, stamping, welding, and sealing. It is now\nbusy building things like clocks, typewriters, automobile steering\nassemblies, and electrical parts. No one-job worker, it can be\nre-programmed for other operations when a new product is needed, or\nquickly switched to another assembly line if necessary. Billed as a new\nhand for industry, TransfeRobot obviously has its foot in the door\nalready. United States Industries estimates current yearly sales of its\nsmall automation equipment at about $3 million.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Massachusetts Institute of Technology_\n\n  Dr. Heinrich Ernst, Swiss graduate student at MIT, watches his\n    computer-controlled \u201chand\u201d pick up a block and drop it in the box.\n]\n\nThe robots in \u010capek\u2019s play _R.U.R._ looked like their human makers, but\nscientist Claude Shannon is more realistic. \u201cThese robots will probably\nbe something squarish and on wheels, so they can move around and not\nhurt anybody and not get hurt themselves. They won\u2019t look like the\ntin-can mechanical men in comic strips. But you\u2019ll want them about\nman-size, so their hands will come out at table-top or assembly-line\nlevel.\u201d Since Professor Shannon is the man who sparked the\nimplementation of symbolic logic in computers, his ideas are not\ncrackpot, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Hand project\nis a good start toward a real robot. Dr. Heinrich Ernst, a young Swiss,\ndeveloped Hand with help from Shannon. Controlled by a digital computer,\nthe hand moves about and exercises judgment as it encounters objects.\nSuch research will make true robots of the remotely manipulated machines\nwe have become familiar with in nuclear power experiments, underwater\nexploration, and so forth. Hughes Aircraft\u2019s \u201cMobot\u201d is a good example,\nand it is obvious that the robot\u2019s bones, muscles, and nerves are\navailable. All they need is the brain to match.\n\nWhile we wait fearfully for more robots which look the way we think\nrobots should, the machine quietly takes over controlling more and more\neven bigger projects. The computer does a variety of tasks, from the\nsimple one of cutting rolling-mill stock into optimum lengths to\nminimize waste, to that of running an electronic freight yard in which\ncars are classified and made up automatically. The computer in this\napplication not only measures the car and weighs it, but also computes\nits rollability. Using radar as its eyes, the computer gauges the speed\nand distance between cars as they are being made up and regulates their\nspeed to prevent damaging bumps. To the chagrin of veteran human\nswitchmen, the computer system has proved it can \u201chump\u201d cars\u2014send them\ncoasting to a standing car for coupling\u2014without the occasional\nresounding crash caused by excessive speed.\n\nAbout all that is holding up similarly automated subway trains in the\nUnited States is approval from the union. Soviet Russia claims she\nalready has computer-run subways and even ships. The latter application\ntook place on the oil tanker _Engineer Pustoshkin_ plying the Caspian\nSea. The main complaint of the director of this research work, P.\nStrumpe, is that ships are not yet designed for computer control and\nwill change for the better when their designers realize the error of\ntheir ways.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Hughes Aircraft Company_\n\n  Mobot Mark II, carrying a Geiger counter in its \u201chands,\u201d demonstrates\n    how it can substitute for men in dangerously radiated areas.\n]\n\nMinneapolis-Honeywell in this country is working toward the complete\nautomation of buildings, pointing out that they are as much machines as\nstructures. A 33-story skyscraper in Houston will use a central computer\nto check 400 points automatically and continuously. Temperature and\nhumidity will be monitored, as well as doors and windows. Presence of\nsmoke and fire will be automatically detected, and all mechanical\nequipment will be monitored and controlled. Equipped with cost figures,\nthe central computer will literally \u201crun\u201d the building for optimum\nefficiency and economy. Harvard University has a central control for\nseventy-six campus buildings, and in Denver work is being done toward a\ncentral control for a number of large buildings. It is fitting that\nautomation of buildings be carried on, since historically it was in the\nhome that self-control of machines was pioneered with automatic control\nof furnaces with thermostats.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Robodyne Division, U.S. Industries, Inc._\n\n  TransfeRobot assembly-line worker installs clockwork parts with speed\n    and precision.\n]\n\nIn this country our traffic is crying for some kind of control, and New\nYork is already using punched-card programming to control part of the\ncity\u2019s traffic. The Federal administration is studying a bold proposal\nfrom RCA, Bendix, General Motors, and Westinghouse for an automatically\ncontrolled highway. The reason? Traffic is getting to be too much for\nthe human brain to deal with. A better one has to be found, and the\ncomputer is applying for the job.\n\nThe coming of automation has been likened to a tidal wave. It is useless\nto shovel against it, and the job would seem to be to find suitable life\npreservers to keep us afloat as it sweeps in over the world. One\napproach is that of a nonprofit foundation to study the impact of\nautomation on workers. This group, a joint United States Industries,\nInc., and International Association of Machinists organization, has\nalready come up with a scheme for collecting \u201cdues\u201d from the machines,\nin annual amounts of from $25 to $1,000, depending on the work output of\nthe machine.\n\nA key project of the foundation is a study of effective retraining of\nworkers to fit them for jobs in the new, computerized factory. Such\nstudies may well have to be extended from the assembly line to the\nwhite-collar worker and executive as well. The computer can wear many\ndifferent kinds of hats!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n         Teaching Machine Age\n    Lilyn E. Carlton in _Saturday Review_\n\n    \u201c_In the good old-fashioned school days,\n     Days of the golden rule,\n     Teacher said, \u2018Good morning, class,\u2019\n     And so she started school._\n\n     _Alas! How different things are now,\n     The school day can\u2019t begin\n     Till someone finds the socket\n     And plugs the teacher in._\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                       10: The Academic Computer\n\n\n     It was inevitable that the computer invade, or perhaps \u201cinfiltrate\u201d\nis the better word, our education system. Mark I and ENIAC were\nuniversity-born and -bred, and early research work was done by many\ninstitutions using computers. A logical development was to teach formal\ncourses in using the computer. While application of the machine in\nmathematical and scientific work came first, its application to business\nand to the training of executives for such use of the computer was soon\nrecognized. As an example, one of two computers installed by U.C.L.A. in\n1957 was for use exclusively in training engineering executives as well\nas undergraduates in engineering economy.\n\nEarly courses were aimed at those already in industry, in an attempt to\ncatch them up with the technology of computer-oriented systems in\nbusiness and science. As special courses, many of these carried a high\ntuition fee. Next came the teaching of professors and deans of\nengineering institutions in techniques of computer education for\nundergraduates. Today the computer is being taught to many students in\nmany schools. New York University has a $3 million computer at its\nCourant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, being used by students in\nbasic and applied research on projects ranging from the design of\nbridges to the analysis of voting patterns in Congress.\n\nM.I.T. recently added a digital computer to teach its students the\noperation of electronic data-processing equipment. Another computer is\nused in more sophisticated work including speech analysis, study of\nbioelectrical signals, and the simulation of automata as in the \u201cHand\u201d\nproject. At the computing center of the University of Michigan a second\ngeneration of computers is being installed. Students in some one hundred\ndifferent courses use these computers, programming them with a language\ndeveloped at the University and called MAD, for Michigan Algorithm\nDecoder. These are typical examples of perhaps two hundred schools using\ncomputers.\n\nThat knowledge of computer techniques is essential for the engineering\ngraduate is evident in the fact that of a recent class of such students\nat Purdue, 1,600 used the computer during the term. Less known is the\nintegration of computer courses in secondary education. The Royal McBee\nCorporation teaches a special course on the computer to youngsters at\nStaples High in Westport, Connecticut. At the end of the first four-week\nsession it was found that the students, fifteen to seventeen years old,\nhad learned faster than adults. At New York\u2019s St. Vincent Ferrer\nCatholic High School, 400 girls participated in a similar project\nconducted by Royal McBee. Other high schools are following suit, and\ncomputers are expected to appear in significant numbers in high schools\nbefore the end of 1962. Textbooks on computers, written for high-school\nstudents, are available. As an example of the ability of young people in\nthis field, David Malin of Walter Johnson High School in Rockville,\nMaryland, read his own paper on the use of computers to simulate human\nthought processes to science experts attending the 1961 Eastern Joint\nComputer Conference held in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe use of the computer in the classroom encompasses not only colleges\nand high schools, but extends even to prisons. Twenty inmates of a\nPennsylvania state institution attended a pilot program teaching\ncomputer techniques with a UNIVAC machine.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Datamation_\n\n  Seventeen-year-old David Malin who presented a paper on computers at\n    the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in 1961.\n]\n\nThe United States is not alone in placing importance on the computer in\nschools. Our Department of Commerce has published details of Russian\nwork in this direction, noting that it began in 1955 and places high\npriority on the training of specialists in computer research, machine\ntranslation, automation, and so on. The Department of Commerce feels\nthat these courses, taught at the graduate, undergraduate, and even\nhigh-school level, are of high quality.\n\n\n                          _Teaching Machines_\n\nThus far we have talked of the computer only as a tool to be studied and\nnot as an aid to learning in itself. In just a few years, however, the\n\u201cteaching machine\u201d has become familiar in the press and controversial\nfrom a number of standpoints, including those of being a \u201cdehumanizer\u201d\nof the process of teaching and a threat to the apple business!\n\nActually, the computer has functioned for some time outside the\nclassroom as a teaching machine. Early applications of analog computers\nas flight simulators were true \u201cteaching machines\u201d although perhaps the\nact was not as obvious as classroom use of a computer to teach the three\nR\u2019s. Even today, there are those who insist that such use of the\ncomputer by the military or industry offers more potential than an\nacademic teaching machine. Assembly workers have been taught by\nprogrammed audiovisual machines such as Hughes Aircraft\u2019s Videosonic\ntrainer, and the government has taught many technicians by computer\ntechniques. A shrewd observer, however, noting that the computer is\ncalled stupid, bluntly points out that any untaught student is in the\nsame category, and that perhaps it takes one to teach one.\n\nA strong motivation for looking to the machine as a public teaching tool\nis the desperation occasioned by the growing shortage of teachers. If\nthe teaching machine could take over even some of the more simple chores\nof the classroom, early advocates said, it would be worth the effort.\n\nFormal study of machine methods of teaching have a history of forty\nyears or more. In the 20\u2019s, Sydney Pressey designed and built automatic\nteaching\u2014or more precisely, testing\u2014machines at Ohio State University.\nThese were simply multiple-choice questions so mechanized as to be\nanswered by the push of a button rather than with a pencil mark. A right\nanswer advanced the machine to the next question, while an error\nrequired the student to try again. Pressey wisely realized the value in\nhis machines; the student could proceed at his own pace, and his\nlearning was also stimulated by immediate recognition of achievement. To\nfurther enforce this learning, some of the teaching machines dispensed\ncandy for a correct answer. Using this criterion, it would seem that\nbrighter students could be recognized by their weight.\n\nUnfortunately, Pressey\u2019s teaching machines did not make a very big\nsplash in the academic world, because of a combination of factors. The\nmachines themselves had limitations in that they did not present\nmaterial to be learned but were more of the nature of _a posteriori_\ntesting devices. Too, educators were loath to adopt the mechanized\nteachers for a variety of reasons, including skepticism, inertia,\neconomics, and others. However, machine scoring of multiple-choice tests\nmarked with special current-conducting pencils became commonplace.\n\nAnother researcher, B. F. Skinner, commenced work on a different kind of\nteaching machine thirty years ago at Harvard. Basically his method\nconsists of giving the subject small bits\u2014not computer \u201cbits,\u201d but the\ncoincidence is interesting\u2014of learning at a time, and reinforcing these\nbits strongly and immediately. Skinner insists that actual \u201crecall\u201d of\ninformation is more important than multiple-choice \u201crecognition,\u201d and he\nasks for an answer rather than a choice. Called \u201coperant reinforcement,\u201d\nthe technique has been used not only on man, but on apes, monkeys, rats,\ndogs, and surprisingly, pigeons.\n\nDuring World War II, Dr. Skinner conducted \u201cProject Pigeon\u201d for the\nmilitary. In this unusual training program, the feathered students were\ntaught to peck at certain targets in return for which they received food\nas a reward. This combination of apt pupils and advanced teaching\nmethods produced pigeons who could play ping-pong. This was in the early\ndays of missile guidance, and the pigeons next went into training as a\nhoming system for these new weapons! To make guidance more reliable, not\none but three pigeons were to be carried in the nose of the device.\nLenses in the missile projected an image before each pigeon, who\ndutifully pecked at his \u201ctarget.\u201d If the target was in the center of the\ncross hairs, the missile would continue on its course; if off to one\nside, the pecking would actuate corrective maneuvers. As Project\n\u201cOrcon,\u201d for Organic Control, this work was carried on for some time\nafter the end of the war. Fortunately for the birds, however, more\nsophisticated, inorganic guidance systems were developed.\n\nThe implications of the pigeon studies in time led to a new teaching\nmethod for human beings. Shortly after Skinner released a paper on his\nwork in operant reinforcement with the pigeons, many workers in the\nteaching field began to move in this direction. For several years\nSkinner and James Holland have been using machines of this type to teach\nsome sections of a course in human behavior to students at Radcliffe and\nHarvard. Rheem Califone manufactures the DIDAK machine to Skinner\u2019s\nspecifications.\n\nTo the reasons advanced by those who see teacher shortages looming,\nSkinner adds the argument that a machine can often teach better. Too\nmuch time, he feels, has been spent on details that are not basic to the\nproblem. Better salaries for teachers, more teachers, and more schools\ndo not in themselves improve the actual teaching. Operant reinforcement,\nSkinner contends, _does_ get at the root of the problem and, in addition\nto relieving the teacher of a heavy burden, the teaching machine\nachieves better results in some phases of teaching. It also solves\nanother problem that plagues the educator today. It is well known that\nnot all of us can learn at the same rate. Since it is economically and\nculturally impossible except in rare cases to teach children in groups\nof equal ability, a compromise speed must be established. This is fine\nfor the \u201caverage\u201d child, of whom there may actually be none in the\nclassroom; it penalizes the fast student, and the slow student perhaps\neven more. The teaching machine, its proponents feel, takes care of this\ndifficulty and lets each proceed at his own rate. Since speed in itself\nis no sure indicator of intelligence, the slow child, left to learn as\nhe can, may reach heights not before dreamed possible for him.\n\nMany educators agree that automated teaching is past due. James D. Finn,\nProfessor of Education at the University of Southern California,\ndeplores the lack of modern technology in teaching. \u201cTechnology during\nthe period from 1900 to 1950 only washed lightly on the shores of\ninstruction,\u201d he says. \u201cThe cake of custom proved to be too tough and\nthe mass production state, at least 100 years behind industry, was not\nentered except here and there on little isolated islands.\u201d\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Educational Science Division,_\n\n  _U.S. Industries, Inc._\n\n  AutoTutor teaching machine has programs for teaching many subjects.\n]\n\nThese little isolated islands are now getting bigger and closer\ntogether. The Air Force has for some time trained technicians at Keesler\nField with U.S. Industries AutoTutor machines, and also uses them at the\nWright Air Development Center. The Post Office Department has purchased\nfifty-five U.S. Industries\u2019 Digiflex trainers. Following this lead,\npublic education is beginning to use teaching machines. San Francisco\nhas an electronic computer version that not only teaches, tests, and\ncoaches, but even sounds an alarm if the student tries to \u201cgoof off\u201d on\nany of the problems. The designers of the machine selected a sure-fire\nintellectual acronym, PLATO, for Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching\nOperations. The System Development Corporation, the operations firm that\ndesigned the SAGE computer, calls its computer-controlled classroom\nteacher simply CLASS. This machine uses a Bendix G-15 computer to teach\ntwenty youngsters at a time.\n\nTo show the awareness of the publishers of texts and other educational\nmaterial, firms like Book of Knowledge, Encyclopedia Britannica Films,\nand TMI Grolier are in the \u201cteaching machine\u201d business, and the\nMcGraw-Hill Book Company and Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc., have teamed\nto produce computerized teaching machines and the programs for them.\nOther publishers using \u201cprogramming\u201d techniques in their books include\nHarcourt-Brace with its 2600 series (for 2,600 programmed steps the\nstudent must negotiate), Prentice-Hall, and D. C. Heath. Entirely new\nfirms like Learning, Incorporated, are now producing \u201cprograms\u201d on many\nsubjects for teaching machines.\n\nSubjects available in teaching machine form include algebra,\nmathematics, trigonometry, slide rule fundamentals, electronics,\ncalculus, analytical geometry, plane geometry, probability theory,\nelectricity, Russian, German, Spanish, Hebrew, spelling, music\nfundamentals, management science, and even Goren\u2019s bridge for beginners.\n\nWhile many of these teaching machines are simply textbooks programmed\nfor faster learning, the conversion of such material into\ncomputer-handled presentation is merely one of economics. For example, a\nDoubleday TutorText book costs only a few dollars; an automatic\nAutoTutor Mark II costs $1,250 because of its complex searching facility\nthat requires several thousand branching responses. However, the\nAutoTutor is faster and more effective and will operate twenty-four\nhours a day if necessary. With sufficient demand the machine may be the\ncheaper in the long run.\n\nThe System Development Corporation feels that its general concept of\nautomated group education will be feasible in the near future despite\nthe high cost of advanced electronic digital computers. It cites pilot\nstudies being conducted by the State of California on data-processing\nfor a number of schools through a central facility. Using this same\napproach, a single central computer could serve several schools with\nauxiliary lower-priced equipment. Even a moderately large computer used\nin this way could teach a thousand or more students simultaneously and\n_individually_, the Corporation feels. After school hours, the computer\ncan handle administrative tasks.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _System Development Corp._\n\n  The CLASS facility incorporates an administrative area, hallway,\n    combined observation and counseling area, and a large classroom area\n    divided by a folding wall.\n]\n\nIn the CLASS system developed by the System Development Corporation, the\n\u201cbranching\u201d concept is used. In a typical lesson program, if the student\nimmediately answers that America was discovered by Christopher Columbus,\nhe will be told he is correct and will then be branched to the next\nitem. If he answers Leif Ericson, the computer takes time out to\nenlighten the pupil on that score. Next, it reinforces the correct date\nin the student\u2019s mind before asking another question. Although it would\nseem that a lucky student could progress through the programmed lesson\non guesswork alone, the inexorable laws of probability rule this out. He\ncannot complete the lesson until he has soaked up all the information it\nis intended to impart. He can do this without an error, in a very short\ntime, or he can learn by the trial-and-error process, whichever is\nbetter suited to his speed and mental ability.\n\nMaking up the program for the teaching machine is a difficult task and\nrequires the services of technical expert, psychologist, and programmer.\nAn English-like language is used in preparing a CLASS program for the\ncomputer. Put on magnetic tape, the program goes into the memory of the\ncomputer and is called out by proper responses from the student as he\nprogresses through the lesson.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _System Development Corp._\n\n  Students in CLASS are learning French in a group mode of automated\n    instruction.\n]\n\nComplex as the programming is, entries from the student\u2019s control are\nprocessed into the computer in about one-tenth of a second, and an\nanswer is flashed back in about the same amount of time. Remember that\nthe CLASS computer is handling twenty students at a time, and that in\naddition to teaching it is keeping a complete record of how the student\nfared at each step of the lesson.\n\nIt is obvious that the binary or yes-no logic of the computer ties in\nwith the concept put forth by Skinner and others of presenting small\nbits of information at a time. We can use the game of 20 Questions as a\ngood analogy. Even getting only simple yes-no answers, skilled players\ncan elicit an amazing amount of information in often far less than the\npermitted number of questions. Thus even complex subjects can be broken\ndown into simple questions answerable by discrete choices from the\nstudent.\n\nThe automated group education system of the System Development\nCorporation is made up of the following components: a digital computer\nto control and select the material presented and to analyze responses, a\nmagnetic tape storage unit, a typewriter for printing out data analysis,\na slide projector and screen for presenting educational materials, and\nindividual desks with keyboards for the students\u2019 responses.\n\nWe have pointed out that even though it is possible to break down\neducational material into multiple-choice or yes-no answers to which are\nassigned intrinsic values, the ideal system permits answers on a linear\nscale. In other words, instead of picking what he considers the most\nnearly correct, a student writes his own answer. Some experts feel that\nthe advances being made in optical scanning, or \u201creading\u201d techniques for\ncomputers, will result in linear programming of the teaching machines\nwithin the next ten years. Such a development will do much to alleviate\nthe complaint that the machine exerts a rigid mechanizing effect on the\nteaching process.\n\nWhile fear of displacement motivates some teachers to distrust the\nmachine, an honest belief that the human touch is necessary in the\nschoolroom is also a large factor against acceptance. Yet these same\nwary teachers generally use flash cards, flip charts, and other\nmechanical aids with no qualms. The electronic computer is a logical\nextension of audiovisual techniques, and in time the teacher will come\nto accept it for what it is.\n\nThe human teacher will continue to be an indispensable element in\neducation, but he must recognize that as our technology becomes more\ncomplex he will need more and more help. In 1960 there were about 44\nmillion students in our classrooms, and about 135,000 too few teachers.\nBy 1965 it is estimated there will be 48 million students and 250,000\nteachers fewer than we need. Parallel with this development is the\nrapidly growing need for college graduates. One large industrial firm\nwhich employs 150,000 hires only 300 college graduates a year at\npresent, but will need 7,000 when it automates its plants. The pressure\nof need thus is forcing our educational system to make use of the most\nefficient means of educating our students.\n\nBeyond simply taking its place with other aids, however, the computer\nwill make great changes in our basic concepts of teaching, according to\nDr. Skinner. He asks the question \u201cAre the students who learn in spite\nof a confusing presentation of a subject better for the experience, or\nwere they better students at the outset?\u201d He advances this argument to\nsay that perhaps \u201ceasy\u201d learning is actually the best; that we would do\nwell to analyze the behavior called thinking and then produce it\naccording to these specifications. The traditional teacher finds the\nprospect alarming and questions the soundness of minimizing failure and\nmaximizing success.\n\nThere is not yet definite agreement by other psychologists with\nSkinner\u2019s contention that recall rather than recognition is the desired\nmethod. Neither is it sure that the negative reinforcement of a number\nof incorrect choices may result in remembering wrong answers. And of\ncourse the division between rote learning and creativity is an important\nconsideration. The answers may well lie in the computer, which when\nproperly programmed is about the most logical device we have available\nto us. Thus the machine may determine the best teaching methods and then\nuse them to teach us. Regardless of these as yet unanswered questions,\nhowever, the future of the teaching machine seems to be assured. One\nauthority has predicted that it will be a $100 million market by 1965.\n\nAn intriguing use of computer techniques in teaching is being\ninvestigated by Corrigan Communications, which scores students answering\nquestions on telecourses. This work is being done with a course in\nmedicine, and with the rapid growth of educational television the\nimplications of combining it and teaching machine techniques are of\ngreat importance.\n\nClassroom teaching is not the only educational application for the\nteaching machine. A computer-controlled library is an interesting\nthought, with the patron requesting information from a central computer\nand having it presented instantaneously on a viewing screen in front of\nhim. Such a system could conceivably have access to a national library\nhookup, constantly updated with new material. Such a service would also\nbe available for use during school study hall, or by the teacher during\nclass.\n\nVisitors to the World\u2019s Fair in Seattle previewed the computerized\ninformation center of the future. Called Library 21, it is considered a\nprototype of the next century\u2019s core libraries which will be linked to\nsmaller branches by communications networks. Many computers were\ndisplayed, tied in with teaching machines, language laboratories, and\ninformation from the Great Books, tailored to the individual\nquestioner\u2019s sex, personality, and mental level. Also shown was a photo\nprocess that reduces a 400-page book to the size of a postage stamp for\nstorage.\n\nWith this kind of progress, we can in the foreseeable future request and\nreceive up-to-date information of any kind of human knowledge\nanywhere\u2014in language we can understand. Another computer application\nsure to come is that of handling correspondence courses. The teaching of\nextension courses in the home, through television and some sort of\nresponse link, has been mentioned, and it is not impossible that the\nschool as a physical plant may one day no longer be necessary.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  This system supplies legal information in minutes, with insertion of\n    punched-card query (top). Using inquiry words, computer prints\n    citations of statutes (middle); then, on request, full text (below).\n]\n\nSince the computer itself does not \u201cteach,\u201d but merely acts as a\ngo-between for the man who prepared the lesson or program and the\nstudent who learns, it would seem that some of our teachers may become\nprogrammers. The System Development Corporation has broken the teaching\nmachine program into three phases: experimenting with the effects of\nmany variables on teaching machine effectiveness, developing a\nsimplified teaching machine, and finally, analyzing the educational\nsystem to find where and how the machine fits. Research is still in the\nfirst phase, that of experiment. But it is known that some programs\nproduced so far show better results than conventional teaching methods,\nand also that teaching machines can teach any subject involving factual\ninformation. Thus it is evident they will be useful in schools and also\nin industry and military training programs.\n\n\n                               _Language_\n\nIf man is to use the computer to teach himself, he must be able to\nconverse with it. In the early days of computers it was said with a good\ndeal of justification that the machine was not only stupid but decidedly\ninsular as well. In other words, man spoke to it in its own language or\nnot at all. A host of different languages, or \u201ccompilers\u201d as they are\noften called, were constructed and their originators beat the drums for\nthem. With tongues like ALGY, ALGOL, COBOL, FACT, FLOWMATIC, FORTRAN,\nINTERCOM, IT, JOVIAL, LOGLAN, MAD, PICE, and PROLAN, to name a few, the\ncomputer has become a tower of Babel, and a programmer\u2019s talents must\ninclude linguistics.\n\nOne language called ALGOL, for Algorithmic Oriented Language, had pretty\nsmooth sailing, since it consists of algebraic and arithmetic notation.\nOut of the welter of business languages a compromise Common Business\nOriented Language, or COBOL, evolved. What COBOL does for programming\ncomputer problems is best shown by comparing it with instructions once\ngiven the machine. The sample below is typical of early machine\nlanguage:\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  SUBTRACT QUANTITY-SOLD FROM BALANCE-ON-HAND. IF BALANCE-ON-HAND IS NOT\n    LESS THAN REORDER-LEVEL THEN GO TO BALANCE-OK ELSE COMPUTE\n    QUANTITY-TO-BUY = TOTAL-SALES-3-MOS/3.\n]\n\nRecommended by a task force for the Department of Defense, industry, and\nother branches of the government, COBOL nevertheless has had a tough\nfight for acceptance, and there is still argument and confusion on the\nlanguage scene. New tongues continue to proliferate, some given birth by\nALGOL and COBOL themselves. Examples of this generation are GECOM,\nBALGOL, and TABSOL. One worthy attempt at a sort of machine Esperanto is\ncalled a pun-inviting UNCOL, for Universal Computer-Oriented Language\nand seems to be a try for the computer\u2019s vote. One harried\nmachine-language user has suggested formation of an \u201cALGOLICS Anonymous\u201d\ngroup for others of his ilk, while another partisan accuses his\ncolleagues in Arizona of creating a new language while \u201cmaddened by the\nscent of saguaro blossoms.\u201d\n\nIt was recently stated that perhaps by the time a decision is ultimately\nreached as to which will be the general language, there will be no need\nof it because by then the computer will have learned to read and write,\nand perhaps to listen and to speak as well. Recent developments bear out\nthe contention.\n\nAlthough it has used intermediate techniques, the computer has proved it\ncan do a lot with our language in some of the tasks it has been given.\nAmong these is the preparation of a Bible concordance, listing principal\nwords, frequency of appearance, and where they are found. The computer\ntackled the same job on the poems of Matthew Arnold. For this chore,\nProfessor Stephen Maxfield Parrish of Cornell worked with three\ncolleagues and two technicians to program an IBM 704 data-processing\nsystem. In addition to compiling the list of more than 10,000 words used\nmost often by Arnold, the computer arranged them alphabetically and also\ncompiled an appendix listing the number of times each word appeared. To\ncomplete the job, the computer itself printed the 965-page volume. The\nDead Sea Scrolls and the works of St. Thomas Aquinas have also been\nturned over to the computer for preparation of analytical indexes and\nconcordances.\n\nAt Columbia University, graduate student James McDonough gave an IBM 650\nthe job of sleuthing the author of _The Iliad_ and _The Odyssey_. Since\nthe computer can detect metric-pattern differences otherwise practically\nundiscoverable, McDonough felt that the machine could prove if Homer had\nwritten both poems, or if he had help on either. Thus far he is sure the\nentire _Iliad_ is the work of one man, after computer analysis of its\n112,000 words. The project is part of his doctoral thesis. A recent\narticle in a technical journal used a title suggested by an RCA 501, and\nsuspicion is strong that the machines themselves are guilty of burning\nmidnight kilowatts to produce the acronyms that abound in the industry.\nThe computer is even beginning to prove its worth as an abstracter.\n\nOther literary jobs the computer has done include the production of a\nbook of fares for the International Air Transport Association. The\ncomputer compiled and then printed out this 420-page book which gives\nshortest operating distances between 1,600 cities of the world. Now\nnewspapers are beginning to use computers to do the work of typesetting.\nThese excursions into the written language of human beings, plus its\nexperience as a poet and in translation from language to language, have\nundoubtedly brought the computer a long way from its former\nprovincialism.\n\nAs pointed out, computer work with human language generally is not\naccomplished without intermediate steps. For example, in one of the\nconcordances mentioned, although the computer required only an hour to\nbreeze through the work, a programmer had spent weeks putting it in the\nproper shape. What is needed is a converter which will do the work\ndirectly, and this is exactly what firms like Digitronics supply to the\nindustry. This computer-age Berlitz school has produced converters for\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith for use in billing its\nstock-market customers, Wear-Ever as an order-taking machine, _Reader\u2019s\nDigest_ for mailing-list work, and Schering Corporation for rat-reaction\nstudies in drug research, to mention a few.\n\nThe importance of such converters is obvious. Prior to their use it was\nnecessary to type English manually into the correct code, a costly and\ntime-consuming business. Converters are not cheap, of course, but they\noperate so rapidly that they pay for themselves in short order. Merrill\nLynch\u2019s machine cost $120,000, but paid back two-thirds of that amount\nin savings the first year. There is another important implication in\nconverter operation. It can get computer language out of English\u2014or\nJapanese, or even Swahili if the need arises. A more recent Digitronics\u2019\nconverter handles information in English or Japanese.\n\nIf the computer has its language problems, man has them also, to the\n_n_th degree. There are about 3,000 tongues in use today; mercifully,\nscientific reports are published in only about 35 of these. Even so, at\nleast half the treatises published in the world cannot be read by half\nthe world\u2019s scientists. Unfortunately, UNESCO estimates that while 50\nper cent of Russian scientists read English, less than 1 per cent of\nUnited States scientists return the compliment! The ramifications of\nthese facts we will take up a little later on; for now it will be\nsufficient to consider the language barrier not only to science but also\nto culture and the international exchange of good will that can lead to\nand preserve peace. Esperanto, Io, and other tongues have been tried as\ncommon languages. One recent comer to the scientific scene is called\nInterlingua and seems to have considerable merit. It is used in\ninternational medical congresses, with text totaling 300,000 words in\nthe proceedings of one of these. But a truly universal language is, like\nprosperity, always just around the corner. Even the scientific\ncommunity, recognizing the many benefits that would accrue, can no more\nadopt Interlingua or another than it can settle on the metric system of\nmeasurement. Our integration problems are not those of race, color, and\ncreed only.\n\nBefore Sputnik our interest in foreign technical literature was not as\nkeen as it has been since. One immediate result of the satellite\nlaunching by the Russians was amendment of U.S. Public Law 480 to permit\nmoney from the sale of American farm equipment abroad to be used for\ntranslation of foreign technical literature. We are vitally concerned\nwith Russia, but have also arranged for thousands of pages of scientific\nliterature from Poland, Yugoslavia, and Israel. Communist China is\nbeginning to produce scientific reports too, and Japanese capability in\nsuch fields as electronics is evident in the fact that the revolutionary\n\u201ctunnel diode\u201d was invented by Esaki in Japan.\n\nIt is understandable that we should be concerned with the output of\nRussian literature, and much attention has been given to the\nRussian-English translator developed by IBM for the Air Force. It is\nestimated that the Russians publish a billion words a year, and that\nabout one-third of this output is technical in nature. Conventional\ntranslating techniques, in addition to being tedious for the\ntranslators, are hopelessly slow, retrieving only about 80 million words\na year. Thus we are falling behind twelve years each year! Outside of a\nmoratorium on writing, the only solution is faster translation.\n\nThe Air Force translator was a phenomenal achievement. Based on a\nphotoscopic memory\u2014a glass disc 10 inches in diameter capable of storing\n55,000 words of Russian-English dictionary in binary code\u2014the system\nused a \u201cone-to-one\u201d method of translation. The result initially was a\ntranslation at the rate of about 40 words per minute of Russian into an\noften terribly scrambled and confusing English. The speed was limited\nnot by the memory or the computer itself but by the input, which had to\nbe prepared on tape by a typist. Subsequently a scanning system capable\nof 2,400 words a minute upped the speed considerably.\n\nImpressive as the translator was, its impact was dulled after a short\ntime when it was found that a second \u201ctranslation\u201d was required of the\nresulting pidgin English, particularly when the content was highly\ntechnical. As a result, work is being done on more sophisticated\ntranslation techniques. Making use of predictive analysis, and \u201clexical\nbuffers\u201d which store all the words in a sentence for syntactical\nanalysis before final printout, scientists have improved the translation\na great deal. In effect, the computer studies the structure of the\nsentence, determining whether modifiers belong with subject or object,\nand checking for the most probable grammatical form of each word as\nindicated by other words in the sentence.\n\nThe advanced nature of this method of translation requires the help of\nlinguistics experts. Among these is Dr. Sydney Lamb of the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley who is developing a computer program for analysis\nof the structure of any language. One early result of this study was the\nrealization that not enough is actually known of language structure and\nthat we must backtrack and build a foundation before proceeding with\ncomputer translation techniques. Dr. Lamb\u2019s procedure is to feed English\ntext into the computer and let it search for situations in which a\ncertain word tends to be preceded or followed by other words or groups\nof words. The machine then tries to produce the grammatical structure,\nnot necessarily correctly. The researcher must help the machine by\ngiving it millions of words to analyze contextually.\n\nWhat the computer is doing in hours is reproducing the evolution of\nlanguage and grammar that not only took place over thousands of years,\nbut is subject to emotion, faulty logic, and other inaccuracies as well.\nAlso working on the translation problem are the National Bureau of\nStandards, the Army\u2019s Office of Research and Development, and others.\nThe Army expects to have a computer analysis in 1962 that will handle 95\nper cent of the sentences likely to be encountered in translating\nRussian into English, and to examine foreign technical literature at\nleast as far as the abstract stage.\n\nDifficult as the task seems, workers in the field are optimistic and\nfeel that it will be feasible to translate all languages, even the\nOriental, which seem to present the greatest syntactical barriers. An\nindication of success is the announcement by Machine Translations Inc.\nof a new technique making possible contextual translation at the rate of\n60,000 words an hour, a rate challenging the ability of even someone\ncoached in speed-reading! The remaining problem, that of doing the\nactual reading and evaluation after translation, has been brought up.\nThis considerable task too may be solved by the computer. The machines\nhave already displayed a limited ability to perform the task of\nabstracting, thus eliminating at the outset much material not relevant\nto the task at hand. Another bonus the computer may give us is the ideal\ninternational and technical language for composing reports and papers in\nthe first place. A logical question that comes up in the discussion of\nprinted language translation is that of another kind of translation,\nfrom verbal input to print, or vice versa. And finally from verbal\nRussian to verbal English. The speed limitation here, of course, is\nhuman ability to accept a verbal input or to deliver an output. Within\nthis framework, however, the computer is ready to demonstrate its great\ncapability.\n\nA recent article in _Scientific American_ asks in its first sentence if\na computer can think. The answer to this old chestnut, the authors say,\nis certainly yes. They then proceed to show that having passed this test\nthe computer must now learn to perceive, if it is to be considered a\ntruly intelligent machine. A computer that can read for itself, rather\nthan requiring human help, would seem to be perceptive and thus qualify\nas intelligent.\n\nEven early computers such as adding machines printed out their answers.\nAll the designers have to do is reverse this process so that printed\nhuman language is also the machine\u2019s input. One of the first successful\nimplementations of a printed input was the use of magnetic ink\ncharacters in the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) system\ndeveloped by General Electric. This technique called for the printing of\ninformation on checks with special magnetic inks. Processed through\nhigh-speed \u201creaders,\u201d the ink characters cause electrical currents the\ncomputer can interpret and translate into binary digits.\n\nClose on the heels of the magnetic ink readers came those that use the\nprinciple of optical scanning, analogous to the method man uses in\nreading. This breakthrough came in 1961, and was effected by several\ndifferent firms, such as Farrington Electronics, National Cash Register,\nPhilco, and others, including firms in Canada and England. We read a\npage of printed or written material with such ease that we do not\nrealize the complex way our brains perform this miracle, and the optical\nscanner that \u201creads\u201d for the computer requires a fantastically advanced\ntechnology.\n\nAs the material to be read comes into the field of the scanner, it is\nilluminated so that its image is distinct enough for the optical system\nto pick up and project onto a disc spinning at 10,000 revolutions per\nminute. In the disc are tiny slits which pass a certain amount of the\nreflected light onto a fixed plate containing more slits. Light which\nsucceeds in getting through this second series of slits activates a\nphotoelectric cell which converts the light into proportionate\nelectrical impulses. Because the scanned material is moving linearly and\nthe rotating disc is moving transversely to this motion, the character\nis scanned in two directions for recognition. Operating with great\nprecision and speed, the scanner reads at the rate of 240 characters a\nsecond.\n\nNational Cash Register claims a potential reading rate for its scanner\nof 11,000 characters per second, a value not reached in practice only\nbecause of the difficulty of mechanically handling documents at this\nspeed. Used in post-office mail sorting, billing, and other similar\nreading operations, optical scanners generally show a perfect score for\naccuracy. Badly printed characters are rejected, to be deciphered by a\nhuman supervisor.\n\nIt is the optical scanner that increased the speed of the\nRussian-English translating computer from 40 to 2,400 words per minute.\nIn post-office work, the Farrington scanner sorts mail at better than\n9,000 pieces an hour, rejecting all handwritten addresses. Since most\nmail\u201485 per cent, the Post Office Department estimates\u2014is typed or\nprinted, the electronic sorter relieves human sorters of most of their\ntask. Mail is automatically routed to proper bins or chutes as fast as\nit is read.\n\nThe electronic readers have not been without their problems. A drug firm\nin England had so much difficulty with one that it returned it to the\nmanufacturer. We have mentioned the one that was confused by Christmas\nseals it took for foreign postage stamps. And as yet it is difficult for\nmost machines to read anything but printed material.\n\nAn attempt to develop a machine with a more general reading ability, one\nwhich recognizes not only material in which exact criteria are met, but\neven rough approximations, uses the _gestalt_ or all-at-once pattern\nprinciple. Using a dilating circular scanning method, the \u201cline drawing\npattern recognizer\u201d may make it possible to read characters of varying\nsizes, handwritten material, and material not necessarily oriented in a\ncertain direction. A developmental model recognizes geometric figures\nregardless of size or rotation and can count the number of objects in\nits scope. Such experimental work incidentally yields much information\non just how the eye and brain perform the deceptively simply tasks of\nrecognition. Once 1970 had been thought a target date for machine\nrecognition of handwritten material, but researchers at Bell Telephone\nLaboratories have already announced such a device that reads cursive\nhuman writing with an accuracy of 90 per cent.\n\nThe computer, a backward child, learned to write long before it could\nread and does so at rates incomprehensible to those of us who type at\nthe blinding speed of 50 to 60 words a minute. A character-generator\ncalled VIDIAC comes close to keeping up with the brain of a high-speed\ndigital computer and has a potential speed of 250,000 characters, or\nabout 50,000 words, per _second_. It does this, incidentally, by means\nof good old binary, 1-0 technique. To add to its virtuosity, it has a\nrepertoire of some 300 characters. Researchers elsewhere are working on\nthe problems to be met in a machine for reading and printing out\n1,000,000 characters per second!\n\nNone of us can talk or listen at much over 250 words a minute, even\nthough we may convince ourselves we read several thousand words in that\nperiod of time. A simple test of ability to hear is to play a record or\ntape at double speed or faster. Our brains just won\u2019t take it. For\nhigh-speed applications, then, verbalized input or output for computers\nis interesting in theory only. However, there are occasions when it\nwould be nice to talk to the computer and have it talk back.\n\nIn the early, difficult days of computer development, say when Babbage\nwas working on his analytical engine, the designer probably often spoke\nto his machine. He would have been stunned to hear a response, of\ncourse, but today such a thing is becoming commonplace. IBM has a\ncomputer called \u201cShoebox,\u201d a term both descriptive of size and\nrefreshing in that is not formed of initial capitals from an ad writer\u2019s\nblurb. You can speak figures to Shoebox, tell it what you want done with\nthem, and it gets busy. This is admittedly a baby computer, and it has a\nvocabulary of just 16 words. But it takes only 31 transistors to achieve\nthat vocabulary, and jumping the number of transistors to a mere 2,000\nwould increase its word count to 1,000, which is the number required for\nBasic English.\n\nThe Russians are working in the field of speech recognition too, as are\nthe Japanese. The latter are developing an ambitious machine which will\nnot only accept voice instructions, but also answer in kind. To make a\ntrue speech synthetizer, the Japanese think they will need a computer\nabout 5,000 times as fast as any present-day type, so for a while it\nwould seem that we will struggle along with \u201ccanned\u201d words appropriately\nselected from tape memory.\n\nWe have mentioned the use of such a tape voice in the computerized\nground-controlled-approach landing system for aircraft, and the airline\nreservation system called Unicall in which a central computer answers a\ndialed request for space in less than three seconds\u2014not with flashing\nlights or a printed message but in a loud clear voice. It must pain the\ncomputer to answer at the snail-like human speed of 150 words a minute,\nso it salves its conscience by handling 2,100 inputs without getting\nflustered.\n\nThe writer\u2019s dream, a typewriter that has a microphone instead of keys\nand clacks away merrily while you talk into it, is a dream no longer.\nScientists at Japan\u2019s Kyoto University have developed a computer that\ndoes just this. An early experimental model could handle a hundred\nJapanese monosyllables, but once the breakthrough was made, the Japanese\nquickly pushed the design to the point where the \u201cSonotype\u201d can handle\nany language. At the same time, Bell Telephone Laboratories works on the\nproblem from the other end and has come up with a system for a\ntypewriter that talks. Not far behind these exotic uses of digital\ncomputer techniques are such things as automatic translation of\ntelephone or other conversations.\n\n\n                        _Information Retrieval_\n\nIt has been estimated that some 445 trillion words are spoken in each\n16-hour day by the world\u2019s inhabitants, making ours a noisy planet\nindeed. To bear out the \u201cnoisy\u201d connotation, someone else has reckoned\nthat only about 1 per cent of the sounds we make are real information.\nThe rest are extraneous, incidentally telling us the sex of the speaker,\nwhether or not he has a cold, the state of his upper plate, and so on.\nIt is perhaps a blessing that most of these trillions of words vanish\nalmost as soon as they are spoken. The printed word, however, isn\u2019t so\ntransient; it not only hangs around, but also piles up as well. The pile\nis ever deeper, technical writings alone being enough to fill seven\n24-volume encyclopedias each day, according to one source. As with our\nspeech, perhaps only 1 per cent of this outpouring of print is of real\nimportance, but this does not necessarily make what some have called the\nInformation Explosion any less difficult to cope with.\n\nThe letters IR once stood for infra-red; but in the last year or so they\nhave been appropriated by the words \u201cinformation retrieval,\u201d one of the\nbiggest bugaboos on the scientific horizon. It amounts to saving\nourselves from drowning in the fallout from typewriters all over the\nearth. There are those cool heads who decry the pushing of the panic\nbutton, professing to see no exponential increase in literature, but a\nsteady 8 per cent or so each year. The button-pushers see it\ndifferently, and they can document a pretty strong case. The technical\ncommunity is suffering an embarrassment of riches in the publications\nfield.\n\nWhile a doubling in the output of technical literature has taken the\nlast twelve years or so, the next such increase is expected in half that\ntime. Perhaps the strongest indication that IR is a big problem is the\nobvious fact that nobody really knows just how much has been, is being,\nor will be written. For instance, one authority claims technical\nmaterial is being amassed at the rate of 2,000 pages a minute, which\nwould result in far more than the seven sets of encyclopedias mentioned\nearlier. No one seems to know for sure how many technical journals there\nare in the world; it can be \u201cpinpointed\u201d somewhere between 50,000 and\n100,000. Selecting one set of figures at random, we learn that in 1960\nalone 1,300,000 different technical articles were published in 60,000\njournals. Of course there were also 60,000 books on technical subjects,\nplus many thousands of technical reports that did not make the formal\njournals, but still might contain the vital bit of information without\nwhich a breakthrough will be put off, or a war lost. Our research\nexpenses in the United States ran about $13 billion in 1960, and the\nguess is they will more than double by 1970. An important part of\nresearch should be done in the library, of course, lest our scientist\nspend his life re-inventing the wheel, as the saying goes.\n\nTo back up this saying are specific examples. For instance, a scientific\nproject costing $250,000 was completed a few days before an engineer\ncame across practically the identical work in a report in the library.\nThis was a Russian report incidentally, titled \u201cThe Application of\nBoolean Matrix Algebra to the Analysis and Synthesis of Relay Contact\nNetworks.\u201d In another, happier case, information retrieval saved Esso\nResearch & Engineering Co. a month of work and many thousands of dollars\nwhen an alert\u2014or lucky\u2014literature searcher came across a Swedish\nscientist\u2019s monograph detailing Esso\u2019s proposed exploration. Another\nliterature search obviated tests of more than a hundred chemical\ncompounds. Unfortunately not all researchers do or can search the\nliterature in all cases. There is even a tongue-in-cheek law which\ngoverns this phenomenon\u2014\u201cMooer\u2019s\u201d Law states, \u201cAn information system\nwill tend not to be used whenever it is more painful for a customer to\nhave information than for him not to have it.\u201d\n\nAs a result, it has been said that if a research project costs less than\n$100,000 it is cheaper to go ahead with it than to conduct a rigorous\nsearch of the literature. Tongue in cheek or not, this state of affairs\npoints up the need for a usable information retrieval system. _Fortune_\nmagazine reports that 10 per cent of research and development expense\ncould be saved by such a system, and 10 per cent in 1960, remember,\nwould have amounted to $1.3 billion. Thus the prediction that IR will be\na $100 million business in 1965 does not seem out of line.\n\nThe Center for Documentation at Western Reserve University spends about\n$6-1/2 simply in acquiring and storing a single article in its files. In\n1958 it could search only thirty abstracts of these articles in an hour\nand realized that more speed was vital if the Center was to be of value.\nAs a result, a GE 225 computer IR system was substituted. Now\nresearchers go through the entire store of literature\u2014about 50,000\ndocuments in 1960\u2014in thirty-five minutes, answering up to fifty\nquestions for \u201ccustomers.\u201d\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  The document file of this WALNUT information retrieval system contains\n    the equivalent of 3,000 books. A punched-card inquiry system locates\n    the desired filmstrip for viewing or photographic reproduction.\n]\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  This image converter of the WALNUT system optically reduces and\n    transfers microfilm to filmstrips for storage. Each strip contains\n    99 document images. As a document image is transferred from\n    microfilm to filmstrip, the image converter simultaneously assigns\n    image file addresses and punches these addresses into punched cards\n    controlling the conversion process.\n]\n\nThe key to information retrieval lies in efficient abstracting. It has\nbeen customary to let people do this task in the past because there was\nno other way of getting it done. Unfortunately, man does not do a\ncompletely objective job of either preparing or using the abstract, and\nthe result is a two-ended guessing game that wastes time and loses facts\nin the process. A machine abstracting system, devised by H. Peter Luhn\nof IBM, picks the words that appear most often and uses them as keys to\nreduce articles to usable, concise abstracts. A satisfactory solution\nseems near and will be a big step toward a completely computerized IR\nsystem.\n\nFor several years there has been a running battle between the computer\nIR enthusiast and the die-hard \u201clibrarian\u201d type who claims that\ninformation retrieval is not amenable to anything but the human touch.\nIt is true that adapting the computer to the task of information\nretrieval did not prove as simple as was hoped. But detractors are in\nmuch the same fix as the man with a shovel trying to build a dike\nagainst an angry rising sea, who scoffs at the scoop-shovel operator\nhaving trouble starting his engine. The wise thing to do is drop the\nshovel and help the machine. There will be a marriage of both types of\nretrieval, but Verner Clapp, president of the Washington, D.C., Council\non Library Resources, stated at an IR symposium that computers offer the\nbest chance of keeping up with the flood of information.\n\nOne sophisticated approach to IR uses symbolic logic, the forte of the\ndigital computer. In a typical _reductio ad logic_, the following\nrequest for information:\n\nAn article in English concerning aircraft or spacecraft, written neither\nbefore 1937 or after 1957; should deal with laboratory tests leading to\nconclusions on an adhesive used to bond metal to rubber or plastic; the\nadhesive must not become brittle with age, must not absorb plasticizer\nfrom the rubber adherent, and must have a peel-strength of 20 lbs/in; it\nmust have at least one of these properties\u2014no appreciable solution in\nfuel and no absorption of solvent.\n\nbecomes the logical statement:\n\nKKaVbcPdeCfg, and KAhiKKKNjNklSmn.\n\nArmed with this symbolic abbreviation, the computer can dig quickly into\nits memory file and come up with the sought-for article or articles.\n\nIt has been suggested that the abstracting technique be applied at the\nopposite end of the cycle with a vengeance amounting to birth control of\nnew articles. A Lockheed Electronics engineer proposes a technical\nlibrary that not only accepts new material, but also rejects any that is\n_not_ new. Here, of course, we may be skirting danger of the type risked\nby human birth control exponents\u2014that of unwittingly depriving the world\nof a president, or a powerful scientific finding. Perhaps the screening,\nthe function of \u201cgarbage disposal,\u201d as one blunt worker puts it, should\nbe left as an after-the-fact measure.\n\nDespite early setbacks, the computer is making progress in the job of\ninformation retrieval. Figures of a 300 per cent improvement in\nefficiency in this new application are cited over the last several\nyears. Operation HAYSTAQ, a Patent Office project in the chemical patent\nsection accounting for one-fifth of all patents, showed a 50 per cent\nimprovement in search speed and 100 per cent in accuracy as a result of\nusing automated methods. Desk-size computer systems with solid-state\ncircuits are being offered for information retrieval.\n\nThe number of scientific information centers in this country, starting\nwith one in 1830, reached 59 in 1940 and now stands at 144.\nSignificantly, of 2,000 scientists and engineers working at these\ncenters, 381 are computer people.\n\nSome representative information retrieval applications making good use\nof computer techniques are the selection of the seven astronauts for the\nMercury Project from thousands of jet pilots, Procter & Gamble\u2019s\nTechnical Information Service, demonstration of an electronic law\nlibrary to the American Bar Association, and Food Machinery and Chemical\nCorporation\u2019s Central Research Laboratory. The National Science\nFoundation, the National Bureau of Standards, and the U.S. Patent Office\nare among the government agencies in addition to the military services\nthat are interested in electronic information retrieval.\n\n\n                               _Summary_\n\nThe impact of the computer on education, language and communication, and\nthe handling of information is obviously already strongly felt. These\ninroads will be increased, and progress hastened in the years ahead of\nus. Perhaps of the greatest importance is the assigning to the machine\nfunctions closer to the roots of all these things. Rather than simply\nread or translate language, for example, the computer seems destined to\nimprove on it. The same applies to the process of teaching and to the\nstorage and retrieval of data. The electronic computer has shown that it\nis not a passive piece of equipment, but active and dynamic in nature.\nIt will soon be as much a part of the classroom and library as books;\none day it may take the place of books themselves.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  Lichty, \u00a9 _Field Enterprises, Inc._\n\n  \u201cHow come they spend over a million on our new school, Miss Finch, and\n    then forget to put in computer machines?\u201d\n]\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u201c_\u2019Tis one and the same Nature that rolls on her course, and whoever has\nsufficiently considered the present state of things might certainly\nconclude as to both the future and the past._\u201d\n\n                    \u2014Montaigne\n\n\n\n\n                           11: The Road Ahead\n\n\nIn Book One of _Les Miserables_, Cosette says, \u201cWould you realize what\nRevolution is, call it Progress; and would you realize what Progress is,\ncall it Tomorrow.\u201d Victor Hugo\u2019s definitions apply well to what has been\ntermed by some the computer revolution and by others simply the natural\nevolution of species. The computer has a past and a present,\ndifferentiated mainly by the slope of the line plotting progress against\ntime. Its future, which blurs somewhat with the present, will obviously\nbe characterized by a line approaching the vertical.\n\nThe intelligent machine has been postulated for years, first by the\nscientist, then by the science-fiction writer, and now again by the\nscientist. Norbert Wiener of cybernetics fame, Ashby and his homeostat,\nGrey Walter and his mechanical turtles, A. M. Turing, John von Neumann,\nand others, have recently been joined by men like Ramo, Samuel, Newell,\n_et al._, who, if not actually beating the drums for machine\nintelligence, do more than admit to the possibility. For each such pro\nthere are cons, of course, from sincere, intelligent authorities who in\neffect holler \u201cGet a horse!\u201d at those who say the computer is coming.\n\nThe Royal Society in England met its stiffest opposition from otherwise\nintelligent people who deplored naturalism in any form. Perhaps such\ndetractors are a necessary goad, a part of progress. At any rate,\nscience survived the Nicholas Gimcrack jibes of the Popes and Addisons\nand Swifts. Darwin was more right than Butler, though the latter\nprobably made more money from his work. Today, we find a parallel\nsituation in that there are those who refuse to accept the computer as\nan intelligent machine, though it is interesting to watch these\nobjectors regroup and draw another line the machine dare not go past.\n\nThe writers of science and pseudo-science have often been accused of\nfantasy and blue-sky dreams. A case in point in the electronics field is\nthe so-called \u201cjournalistor\u201d or marvelous successor to the transistor.\nSuch riding off in all directions with each new laboratory experiment\nmay be justified in that it prods the scientist who must keep up with\nthe press and his advertising department! This theory apparently works,\nand now it seems that the most startling and fantastic stories come not\nfrom writers, but from the scientists themselves.\n\nIn 1960 the Western Joint Computer Conference was held in San Francisco,\nand one session was devoted to the fanciful design and use of a computer\nwith the problem-solving capability of an intelligent man and the speed\nand capacity of a high-speed data-processor. It was proposed to use\n\u201ctunnel-effect tetrodes\u201d with a switching time of one ten-billionth of a\nsecond as the logic and storage elements. These would be fabricated of\nthin-film materials by electron beam micromachining, and 100 billion of\nthem could be packed into a cubic inch volume. With these tiny\ncomponents and new circuit modes a supercomputer could be built, stored\nwith information, and programmed to solve what one of the participants\ncalled the most difficult problem the human being faces today\u2014that of\nbargaining.\n\nThis computer has not yet been built; it won\u2019t be for some time. But\ndesign and fabrication are moving in that direction on a number of\nfronts. One of these fronts is that of hardware, the components used in\nbuilding up the computer circuitry. In a decade we moved from vacuum\ntubes to transistors to thin-film devices. Examples of shrinkage on a\ngross scale are shown in the use of a single ferrite core to replace\nsome twenty conventional (relatively speaking!) components.\n\nMemory circuits once were mechanical relays or tube circuits. Briefly\nthey were transistorized, and then ferrite cores. Magnetic thin-film\ncircuits have now been developed, making random-access storage almost as\ncompact as the sequential tape reel. As circuits grow smaller the major\nproblem is manipulating them, or even seeing them, and a sneeze can be\ndisastrous in today\u2019s electronics plant.\n\nOne early journalistor was the molecular circuit. Many scientists and\nengineers working in the field scoffed at or derided such a visionary\nscheme. But the industry has indeed progressed into the\nintegrated-circuit technology\u2014a sort of halfway point\u2014and is now on the\nfringe of actual functional block techniques in which the individual\ncomponents are not discernible. Electronic switching and other action at\nthe molecular level is close to reality, and hardheaded scientists now\nspeak calmly of using a homogeneous block of material as a memory,\nscanning its three dimensions with the speed of light to locate any one\nor more of billions of bits of data in a few inches of volume.\n\nWriting on the head of a pin was a prophetic bit of showmanship, and\npinhead-size computers will not necessarily have pinhead mentalities.\nThis progress toward a seemingly hopeless goal takes on an inexorable\nquality when the writings of von Neumann are compared with the state of\nthe art today. Starting out much faster but much larger than similar\nelements of the brain, computer components have been made even faster\nwhile simultaneously shrinking dramatically toward the dimensions\nnecessary to produce quantitative equivalence. It happens that these\ngoals work out well together, the one helping the other. Circuitry is\nnow at the point where speed is ultimately dependent on that limiter of\nall physical activity, the speed of light, or of electrons through a\nconductor. Only by putting elements closer together can speed be\nincreased; thus one quality is not achieved at the sacrifice of the\nother.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _International Business Machines Corp._\n\n  This experimental \u201cmemory plane\u201d consists of 135 cryotron devices\n    built up in a 19-layer \u201csandwich.\u201d Produced automatically, it is an\n    example of continued shrinking of computer elements.\n]\n\nAs an example of the progress being made toward speeding up computers,\nspeakers at the recent Winter General Meeting of the American Institute\nof Electrical Engineers described a coming generation of \u201cgigacycle\u201d\ncomputers now on the drawing boards. Present electronic machines operate\nat speeds in the megacycle range, with 50 million cycles per second\nrepresenting the most advanced state of the art. Giga means billion;\nthus the new round of computers will be some thousand times as fast as\nthose now operating.\n\nAmong the firms who plan such ultraspeed computers are RCA, IBM, and\nSperry Rand Corporation. To achieve such a great increase in speed\nrequires faster electronic switches. Transistors have been improved, and\nmore exotic devices such as tunnel diodes, thin-film cryotrons, magnetic\nthin-films, parametrons, and traveling-wave tubes are now coming into\nuse. Much of the development work is being supported by the U.S. Bureau\nof Ships. Operational gigacycle computers are expected within two years!\n\nNot just the brickmaker, but the architect too has been busy in the job\nof optimizing the computer. The science of bionics and the study of\nsymbolic logic lead to better ways of doing things. The computer itself\ncomes up with improvements for its next generation, making one part do\nthe work of five, and eliminating the need for whole sections of\ncircuitry. Most computers have a fixed \u201cclock\u201d; that is, they operate at\na certain cyclic rate. Now appearing on the scene are \u201casynchronous\u201d\ncomputers which don\u2019t stand around waiting when one job is done, as\ntheir predecessors did.\n\nOne advanced notion is the \u201cgrowing\u201d of complex electronic circuitry, in\nwhich a completed amplifier, or array of amplifiers, is pulled from the\ncrystal furnace much the way material for transistors is now grown.\nPooh-poohed at first as ridiculous, the notion has been tried\nexperimentally. Since a computer is basically a multiplicity of simple\nunits, the idea is not far off at that. It is conceivable that crystal\nstructure can be exploited to produce millions of molecules of the\nproper material properly aligned for the desired electronic action.\n\nWith this shrinking come the benefits of small size, low power\nconsumption, low cost, and perhaps lower maintenance. The computer will\nbe cheap enough for applications not now economically feasible. As this\nhappens, what will the computer do for us tomorrow?\n\nA figure of 7 per cent is estimated for the amount of paperwork the\ncomputer has taken over in the business world. Computer men are eyeing a\nmarket some five times that amount. It does not take a vivid imagination\nto decide that such a percentage is perhaps conservative in the extreme.\nComputer sales themselves promise to show a fourfold increase in the\nfive-year period from 1960 to 1965, and in the past predictions have\nbeen exceeded many times.\n\nAs population grows and business expands in physical size and\ncomplexity, it is obvious that the computer and its data-processing\nability will be called upon more and more. There is another factor, that\nof the internationalizing of business. Despite temporary setbacks of\nwar, protective tariffs, insular tendencies, and the like, in the long\nrun we will live in one integrated world shrunk by data links that can\nget information from here to there and back again so fast it will be\nlike conversing with someone across the room. Already planners are\ntalking worldwide computerized systems.\n\nAs a mathematical whiz, the computer will relieve us of our money\nworries. Coupled with the credit card, perhaps issued to us at birth, a\ncentral computer will permit us to make purchases anywhere in the world\nand to credit our account with wages and other income. If we try to\noverdraw, it may even flash a warning light as fast as we put the card\nin the slot! This project interests General Dynamics researchers.\n\nOf more importance than merely doing bookkeeping is the impact the\ncomputer will have on the planning and running of businesses. Although\nit is found in surveys that every person thinks computer application\nreaches to the level just below his in the management structure, pure\nlogic should ultimately win out over man\u2019s emotional frailties at all\nlevels. Operations research, implemented by the computer, will make for\nmore efficient businesses. Decisions will increasingly be made not by\nvice-presidents but by digital computers. At first we will have to\ngather the necessary information for these electronic oracles, but in\ntime they will take over this function themselves.\n\nBusiness is tied closely to education, and we have had a hint of the\nplace the computer will make for itself in education. The effect on our\nmotivation to learn of the little need for much learning will be\ninteresting. But then, is modern man a weaker being because he kills a\ntiger with a high-powered rifle instead of club or bare hands\u2014or has no\nneed to kill the tiger in the first place?\n\nAfter having proved itself as a patent searcher, the computer is sure to\nexcel as inventor. It will invade the artistic field; computers have\nalready produced pleasing patterns of light. Music has felt the effect\nof the computer; the trend will continue. Some day not far off the hi-fi\nenthusiast will turn on his set and hear original compositions one after\nthe other, turned out by the computer in as regular or random form as\nthe hearer chooses to set the controls. Each composition will bring the\nthrill of a new, fresh experience, unless we choose to go back in the\ncomputer\u2019s memory for the old music.\n\nThe computer will do far more in the home than dream up random music for\nlistening pleasure. The recorded telephone answerer will give way to one\nthat can speak for us, making appointments and so on, and remembering to\nbring us up to date when we get home. A small computer to plug in the\nwall may do other things like selecting menus and making food purchases\nfor next week, planning our vacations, and helping the youngsters with\ntheir homework. It is even suggested that the computer may provide us\nwith child-guidance help, plus psychological counsel for ourselves and\nmedical diagnoses for the entire family. The entire house might be\ncomputerized, able to run itself without human help\u2014even after people\nare gone, as in the grimly prophetic story by Ray Bradbury in which a\nneat self-controlled home is shown as the curtains part in the morning.\nA mechanical sweeper runs about gathering up dust, the air conditioning,\nlighting, and entertainment are automatic, all oblivious to the fact\nthat one side of the house is blackened from the blast of a bomb.\n\nPerhaps guarding against that eventuality is the most important job the\ncomputer can do. Applications of computing power to government have been\ngiven; and hints made of the sure path from simple tasks like the census\nand income tax, Peace Corps work, and so on to decision-making for the\npresident. Just as logic is put to work in optimizing business, it can\nbe used to plan and run a taut ship of state. At first such an\nelectronic cabinet member will be given all available information, which\nit will evaluate so as to be ready to make suggestions on policy or\nemergency action. There is more reason for it going beyond this status\nto become an active agent, than there is against. Government has already\nbecome so complex that perhaps a human brain, or a collection of them,\ncannot be depended on to make the best possible decision. As\ncommunications and transportation are speeded up, the problem is\ncompounded. Where once a commander-in-chief could weigh the situation\nfor days before he had to commit himself and his country to a final\nchoice, he may now be called upon to make such a far-reaching decision\nin minutes\u2014perhaps minutes from the time he is awakened from a sound\nsleep. The strongest opposition to this delegation of power is man\u2019s own\nvanity. No machine can govern, even if it can think, the politician\nexclaims. The soldier once felt the same way; but operations research\nhas given him more confidence in the machine, and SAGE and NORAD prove\nto him that survival depends on the speed and accuracy of the electronic\ncomputer.\n\nIncurable romanticism is found even among our scientific community. The\nNational Bureau of Standards describes a computer called ADAM, for\nAbsolutely Divine Automatic Machine. But the scientists also know that\nADAM, or man, needs help. Rather than consider the machine a tool, or\neven an extension of man\u2019s mind, some are now concerned with a kind of\nmarriage of man and machine in which each plays a significant part. Dr.\nSimon Ramo, executive vice president of Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc.,\nhas termed this mating of the minds \u201cintellectronics.\u201d The key to this\ncombination of man\u2019s intellect and that of electronics is closer rapport\nbetween the team members.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Department of Defense_\n\n  Computer use in defense is typified in this BIRDIE system of the\n    United States Army.\n]\n\nThe man-machine concept has grown into a science called, for the present\nat least, \u201csynnoetics,\u201d a coinage from the Greek words _syn_ and _noe_\nmeaning \u201cperceive\u201d and \u201ctogether.\u201d This science is defined as the\ntreating of the properties of composite systems, consisting of\nconfigurations of persons, mechanisms, plant or animal organisms, and\nautomata, whose main attribute is that their ability to invent, to\ncreate, and to reason\u2014their mental power\u2014is greater than the mental\npower of their components.\n\nWe get a not-too-fanciful look into the future in a paper by Dr. Louis\nFein presented in the summer 1961 issue of _American Scientist_, titled\n\u201cComputer-related Sciences (Synnoetics) at a University in 1975.\u201d Dr.\nFein is an authority on computers, as builder of RAYDAC in 1952, and as\nfounder and president of the Computer Control Company. The paper\nostensibly is being given to alumni some years hence by the university\npresident. Dr. Fein tells us that students in the Department of\nSynnoetics study the formal languages used in communication between the\nelements of a synnoetic system, operations research, game theory,\ninformation storage, organization and retrieval, and automatic\nprogramming. One important study is that of error, called Hamartiology,\nfrom the Greek word meaning \u201cto miss the mark.\u201d\n\nThe speaker tells us that this field was variously called cybernetics,\ninformation science, and finally computer-related science before being\nformally changed to the present synnoetics.

This program would evaluate the thousands of alternative\nsettlements and would recommend a small class of settlements each of\nwhich was nearly optimum for both sides. The automaton took only 30\nminutes to produce the new contract last year. It would have taken one\nyear to do this manually, and even then it would have been done less\nexhaustively. Agreeing on the program took one week. Of course, you have\nalready heard that in many areas where people are bargaining or trying\nto make optimum decisions such as in the World Nations Organization, in\nthe World Court, and in local, federal, and world legislative bodies,\nthere is now serious consideration being given to convincing opposing\nfactions to try to agree on a program and having once agreed on it, the\ncontract or legislation or judgment or decision produced with the\nprogram would be accepted as optimum for both sides. Automata may also\nbe provided to judges and juries to advise them of the effects of such\nfactors as weight of evidence on verdicts in civil cases.\n\nDr. Fein makes an excellent case for the usefulness of the science of\nsynnoetics; the main point of challenge to his paper might be that its\ndate is too conservatively distant. Of interest to us here is the idea\nof man and machine working in harmony for the good of both.\n\nAnother paper, \u201cThe Coming Technological Society,\u201d presented by Dr.\nSimon Ramo at the University of California at Los Angeles, May 1, 1961,\nalso discusses the possible results of man-machine cooperation during\nthe remainder of the twentieth century. He lists more than a dozen\nspecific and important applications for intellectronics in the decades\nimmediately ahead of us. Law, medicine, engineering, libraries, money,\nand banking are among these. Pointing out that man is as unsuited for\n\u201cputting little marks on pieces of paper\u201d as he was for building\npyramids with his own muscles, he suggests that our thumbprints and\nelectronic scanners will take care of all accounting. Tongue in cheek,\nhe does say that there will continue to be risks associated with life;\nfor instance, a transistor burning out in Kansas City may accidentally\nwipe out someone\u2019s fortune in Philadelphia.\n\nThe making of reservations is onerous busywork man should not have to\nwaste his valuable time on, and the control of moving things too is\nbetter left to the machine for the different reason that man\u2019s unaided\nbrain cannot cope with complex and high-speed traffic arteries, be they\nin space or on Los Angeles freeways. Business and military management\nwill continue to be aided by the electronic machine.\n\nBut beyond all these benefits are those more important ones to our\nbrains, our society, and culture. Teaching machines, says Dr. Ramo, can\nmake education ten times more effective, thus increasing our intellect.\nAnd this improved intellect, multiplied by the electronic machine into\nintellectronic brainpower, is the secret of success in the world ahead.\nInstead of an automated, robotlike regimented world that some predict,\nRamo sees greater democracy resulting. Using the thumbprint again, and\nthe speed of electronics, government of our country will be truly by the\npeople as they make their feelings known daily if necessary.\n\nIntellectronic legislation will extend beyond a single country\u2019s\nboundaries in international cooperation. It will smash the language and\ncommunication barriers. It will permit and implement not only global\nprediction of weather, but global control as well. Because of the rapid\nhandling of vast amounts of information, man can form more accurate and\nmore logical concepts that will lead to better relations throughout the\nworld. Summing up, Dr. Ramo points out that intellectronics benefits not\nonly the technical man but social man as well:\n\nThe real bottleneck to progress, to a safe, orderly, and happy\ntransition to the coming technological age, lies in the severe disparity\nbetween scientific and sociological advance. Having discussed\ntechnology, with emphasis on the future extension of man\u2019s intellect, we\nshould ask: Will intellectronics aid in removing the imbalance? Will\ntechnology, properly used, make possible a correction of the very\nimbalance which causes technology to be in the lead? I believe that the\nchallenging intellectual task of accelerating social progress is for the\nhuman mind and not his less intellectual partner. But perhaps there is\nhope. If the machines do more of the routine, everyday, intellectual\ntasks and insure the success of the material operation of the world,\nman\u2019s work will be elevated to the higher mental domains. He will have\nthe time, the intellectual stature, and hence the inclination to solve\nthe world\u2019s social problems. We must believe he has the capability.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc._\n\n  Information in many forms can be displayed with \u201cpolymorphic\u201d\n    data-processing systems.\n]\n\nAntedating synnoetics and intellectronics is another idea of such a\nrelationship. In his book _The World, The Flesh and the Devil_, J. D.\nBernal considers man\u2019s replacement of various of his body\u2019s parts with\nmechanical substitutes until the only organic remains would be his\nbrain. This is a sort of wrong-end-to synnoetics, but in 1929 when the\nbook was published there was already plenty of raw material for such a\nnotion. Wooden legs and hooks or claws for hands, metal plates for bone\nmaterial, for example; and the artificial heart already being developed.\nMore recently we have seen the artificial kidney used, along with other\norgans. We have also added electronic gear to our organic components,\nfor example the \u201cpacemaker\u201d implanted in many laggard hearts to keep\nthem beating in proper cadence, plastic plumbing, and the like. There is\na word for this sort of part-organic, part-mechanical man: the name\n\u201ccyborg\u201d for cybernetic organism was proposed by two New York doctors.\nTheir technical definition of cyborg is \u201can exogenously extended\norganizational complex functioning as a homeostatic system.\u201d There is of\ncourse strong precedent in nature for the idea of such a beneficial\ncombination: symbiosis, the co-existence or close union of two\ndissimilar organisms. The shark and his buddy, the pilot fish, are\nexamples; as are man and the many parasites to which he is host.\n\nThe idea of man being part of machine harks back to youthful rides in\nsoapbox racers, and later experiences driving cars or flying aircraft.\nThe pilot who flew \u201cby the seat of his pants\u201d in the early days easily\nfelt himself part of the machine. As planes\u2014and cars\u2014grew bigger and\nmore complex, this \u201cone-manship\u201d became more remote and harder to\nidentify. The jet transport pilot may well have the feeling of handling\na train when he applies force to his controls and must wait for it to be\namplified through a servo system and finally act on the air stream. In\nthe space age the man-machine combination not only survives but also\nflourishes. Arthur C. Clarke writes in a science-fiction story of a\nlegless space man who serves well and happily in the weightlessness of\nhis orbiting satellite station.\n\nWe have two stages of development, then, not necessarily sequential: man\nworking with the machine and man as part of the machine. Several writers\nhave suggested a third stage in which the machine gradually supplants\nthe weaker human being much as other forms eased out the dinosaur of\nold. William O. Stapledon\u2019s book, _Last and First Men_, describes\nimmortal and literal giant brains. Many writers believe that these\n\u201cbrains\u201d will not be man\u2019s, but those of the machine, since frail\nhumanity cannot survive in its increasingly hostile environment.\n\nArthur C. Clarke is most articulate in describing what he calls the\nevolutionary cycle from man to machine. As the discovery of tools by\npre-man created man, so man\u2019s invention of thinking machines set about\nthe workings that will make _him_ extinct. Clarke theorizes that this\nbreakthrough by man may well be his last, and that his machines will\n\u201cthink\u201d him off the face of the earth!\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _Hughes Aircraft Company_\n\n  Withstanding underwater pressures, at depths too great for human\n    divers, a Mobot vehicle demonstrates in this artist\u2019s concept how it\n    can perform salvage and rescue operations at the bottom of the\n    ocean.\n]\n\nAs we move into a technology that embraces communication at a distance\nof millions of miles, survival under death-dealing radiation, and travel\nat fantastic speeds, man\u2019s natural equipment falters and he must rely on\nthe machine both as muscle and brain. Intelligence arose from life but\ndoes not necessarily need life, in the sense we think of it, to\ncontinue. Thus the extension of man\u2019s intellect by electronics as hailed\nby Dr. Ramo will lead ultimately to our extinction.\n\nClarke feels that the man-machine partnership we have entered, while\nmutually benevolent, is doomed to instability and that man with his\nhuman shortcomings will fall by the wayside, perhaps in space, which may\nwell be the machine\u2019s true medium. What will remain will be the\nintelligent machine, reduced as time goes on to \u201cpure\u201d intelligence free\nto roam where it will and do what it wants, a matterless state of\naffairs that even Clarke modestly disclaims the imagination to speculate\nupon.\n\nBefore writing man off as a lost cause, we should investigate a strong\nargument against such a take-over by the machine. Man stands apart from\nother creatures in his consciousness of himself. He alone seems to have\nthe ability to ponder his fate, to reflect, and to write books about his\nthoughts and dreams. Lesser animals apparently take what comes, do what\nthey have to do, and get through this life with a minimum of changing\ntheir environment and themselves. Thus far the machines man has built do\nnot seem to be conscious of themselves. While \u201crational beings,\u201d\nperhaps, they do not have the \u201cability to laugh\u201d or otherwise show\nconscious awareness of their fate. A term applied to primitive\nmechanical beings is \u201cplugsuckers.\u201d They learn to seek out a wall socket\nor other form of energy and nourish themselves much as animals must do.\nJust where man himself switched from plugsucking and began to rewire his\nown world is a fuzzy demarcation, but he seems to have accomplished\nthis.\n\nConsciousness is subjective in the extreme, and thus far only in fiction\nhave computers paused to reflect and consider what they have done and\nits effect on them. However, the machine-builder, if not yet the machine\nitself, is aware of this consciousness problem. The Hoffman Electronics\nCorporation recently published an advertisement in the form of a\nscience-fiction story by A. E. Van Vogt. The hero is a defense vehicle,\npatrolling the Pacific more effectively because it thinks it is king of\nthe Philippine Deep. Its name is Itself, and it has a built-in alter\nego. Hoffman admits it has not produced a real Itself\u2014yet, but points\nout calmly that the company\u2019s business _is_ the conversion of scientific\nfiction to scientific fact.\n\nIt has been suggested that mechanical consciousness may evolve when the\ncomputer begins to reproduce itself, a startling conception blessed in\ntheory by logicians and mathematicians, as well as philosophers. A crude\nself-replicating model has been built by scientists\u2014a toy train that\nreproduces itself by coupling together the proper cars to copy the\nparent train, a whimsical reflection of Samuel Butler\u2019s baby engines\nplaying about the roundhouse door.\n\nSelf-reproducing machines may depend on a basic \u201ccell\u201d containing a\nblueprint of what it should look like when complete, which simply hunts\naround for the proper parts and assembles itself. In the process it may\neven make an improvement or two. Having finished, it will make a carbon\ncopy of its blueprint and start another \u201cbaby\u201d machine on the way.\nWriters on this subject\u2014some under the guise of science-fiction\u2014wonder\nat what point the _machines_ will begin to wonder about how _they_ came\nto be. Will they produce philosophic or religious literature, or will\nthis step in evolution prove that consciousness was a bad mutation, like\nseven fingers or three heads, and drop it from the list of instructions?\n\nClarke admits that the take-over by the machines is centuries off;\nmeantime we can enjoy a golden age of intellectronic partnership with\nthe machine. Linus Pauling, pointing out that knowledge of molecular\nstructure has taken away the mystery of life, hopes that a \u201cmolecular\ntheory of thinking\u201d will be developed and so improve man that he may\nremake his thoughts and his world. Mathematician John Williams believes\nthat existing human intelligence can preserve its distinction only by\nwithdrawing from competition with the machine and defining human\nintelligence rigorously enough to exclude that of the machines. He\nsuggests using the computer not just for a molecular theory of thinking,\nbut also in the science of genetics to _design_ our children!\n\nWhatever lies ahead, it seems obvious that one of the most important\nthings the computer can help us think about is the computer itself. It\nis a big part of our future.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                                 Index\n\n\n Abacus, 5, 21, 22, 60, 85, 129, 178, 181\n\n Abstracting computer, 245, 248\n\n Accuracy\n   analog computer, 82\n   digital computer, 87\n\n Ackerman, 110\n\n ADAM computer, 258\n\n Adaptive principle, 205\n\n Adders, 107, 108, 115\n\n Adding machine, 129\n\n Addition, computer, 106\n\n Address, computer, 63\n\n Advertising, use of computer, 180\n\n AID, 183, 184\n\n AIEE, 254\n\n Aiken, 46\n\n Air Force, 6, 132, 133, 151, 160, 182, 225\n\n Airborne computer, 90, 154, 158, 162\n\n AiResearch Mfg.

Some things are not spoken.  If you were like the\npeople whom Peter Samson was coming to know and befriend in this,\nhis freshman year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in\nthe winter of 1958-59, no explanation would be required.\nWandering around the labyrinth of laboratories and storerooms,\nsearching for the secrets of telephone switching in machine\nrooms, tracing paths of wires or relays in subterranean steam\ntunnels . .  .  for some, it was common behavior, and there was\nno need to justify the impulse, when confronted with a closed\ndoor with an unbearably intriguing noise behind it, to open the\ndoor uninvited.  And then, if there was no one to physically bar\naccess to whatever was making that intriguing noise, to touch the\nmachine, start flicking switches and noting responses, and\neventually to loosen a screw, unhook a template, jiggle some\ndiodes and tweak a few connections.  Peter Samson and his friends\nhad grown up with a specific relationship to the world, wherein\nthings had meaning only if you found out how they worked.  And\nhow would you go about that if not by getting your hands on them?\n\nIt was in the basement of Building 26 that Samson and his friends\ndiscovered the EAM room.  Building 26 was a long glass-and-steel\nstructure, one of MIT's newer buildings, contrasting with the\nvenerable pillared structures that fronted the Institute on\nMassachusetts Avenue.  In the basement of this building void of\npersonality, the EAM room.  Electronic Accounting Machinery.  A\nroom that housed machines which ran like computers.\n\nNot many people in 1959 had even seen a computer, let alone\ntouched one.  Samson, a wiry, curly-haired redhead with a way of\nextending his vowels so that it would seem he was racing through\nlists of possible meanings of statements in mid-word, had viewed\ncomputers on his visits to MIT from his hometown of Lowell,\nMassachusetts, less than thirty miles from campus.  This made him\na \"Cambridge urchin,\" one of dozens of science-crazy high\nschoolers in the region who were drawn, as if by gravitational\npull, to the Cambridge campus.  He had even tried to rig up his\nown computer with discarded parts of old pinball machines: they\nwere the best source of logic elements he could find.\n\nLOGIC ELEMENTS:  the term seems to encapsulate what drew Peter\nSamson, son of a mill machinery repairman, to electronics.  The\nsubject made sense.  When you grow up with an insatiable\ncuriosity as to how things work, the delight you find upon\ndiscovering something as elegant as circuit logic, where all\nconnections have to complete their loops, is profoundly\nthrilling.  Peter Samson, who early on appreciated the\nmathematical simplicity of these things, could recall seeing a\ntelevision show on Boston's public TV channel, WGBH, which gave a\nrudimentary introduction to programming a computer in its own\nlanguage.  It fired his imagination: to Peter Samson, a computer\nwas surely like Aladdin's lamp--rub it, and it would do your\nbidding.  So he tried to learn more about the field, built\nmachines of his own, entered science project competitions and\ncontests, and went to the place that people of his ilk aspired\nto: MIT.  The repository of the very brightest of those weird\nhigh school kids with owl-like glasses and underdeveloped\npectorals who dazzled math teachers and flunked PE, who dreamed\nnot of scoring on prom night, but of getting to the finals of the\nGeneral Electric Science Fair competition.  MIT, where he would\nwander the hallways at two o'clock in the morning, looking for\nsomething interesting, and where he would indeed discover\nsomething that would help draw him deeply into a new form of\ncreative process, and a new life-style, and would put him into\nthe forefront of a society envisioned only by a few\nscience-fiction writers of mild disrepute.  He would discover a\ncomputer that he could play with.\n\nThe EAM room which Samson had chanced on was loaded with large\nkeypunch machines the size of squat file cabinets.  No one was\nprotecting them: the room was staffed only by day, when a select\ngroup who had attained official clearance were privileged enough\nto submit long manila cards to operators who would then use these\nmachines to punch holes in them according to what data the\nprivileged ones wanted entered on the cards.  A hole in the card\nwould represent some instruction to the computer, telling it to\nput a piece of data somewhere, or perform a function on a piece\nof data, or move a piece of data from one place to another.  An\nentire stack of these cards made one computer program, a program\nbeing a series of instructions which yield some expected result,\njust as the instructions in a recipe, when precisely followed,\nlead to a cake.  Those cards would be taken to yet another\noperator upstairs who would feed the cards into a \"reader\" that\nwould note where the holes were and dispatch this information to\nthe IBM 704 computer on the first floor of Building 26.  The\nHulking Giant.\n\nThe IBM 704 cost several million dollars, took up an entire room,\nneeded constant attention from a cadre of professional machine\noperators, and required special air-conditioning so that the\nglowing vacuum tubes inside it would not heat up to\ndata-destroying temperatures.  When the air-conditioning broke\ndown--a fairly common occurrences--a loud gong would sound, and\nthree engineers would spring from a nearby office to frantically\ntake covers off the machine so its innards wouldn't melt.  All\nthese people in charge of punching cards, feeding them into\nreaders, and pressing buttons and switches on the machine were\nwhat was commonly called a Priesthood, and those privileged\nenough to submit data to those most holy priests were the\nofficial acolytes.  It was an almost ritualistic exchange.\n\nACOLYTE:  Oh machine, would you accept my offer of information so\nyou may run my program and perhaps give me a computation?\n\nPRIEST (on behalf of the machine):  We will try.  We promise\nnothing.\n\nAs a general rule, even these most privileged of acolytes were\nnot allowed direct access to the machine itself, and they would\nnot be able to see for hours, sometimes for days, the results of\nthe machine's ingestion of their \"batch\" of cards.\n\nThis was something Samson knew, and of course it frustrated the\nhell out of Samson, who wanted to get at the damn machine.  For\nthis was what life was all about.\n\nWhat Samson did not know, and was delighted to discover, was that\nthe EAM room also had a particular keypunch machine called the\n407.  Not only could it punch cards, but it could also read\ncards, sort them, and print them on listings.  No one seemed to\nbe guarding these machines, which were computers, sort of.  Of\ncourse, using them would be no picnic: one needed to actually\nwire up what was called a plug board, a two-inch-by-two-inch\nplastic square with a mass of holes in it.  If you put hundreds\nof wires through the holes in a certain order, you would get\nsomething that looked like a rat's nest but would fit into this\nelectromechanical machine and alter its personality.  It could do\nwhat you wanted it to do.\n\nSo, without any authorization whatsoever, that is what Peter\nSamson set out to do, along with a few friends of his from an MIT\norganization with a special interest in model railroading.  It\nwas a casual, unthinking step into a science-fiction future, but\nthat was typical of the way that an odd subculture was pulling\nitself up by its bootstraps and growing to underground\nprominence--to become a culture that would be the impolite,\nunsanctioned soul of computerdom.  It was among the first\ncomputer hacker escapades of the Tech Model Railroad Club, or\nTMRC.\n\n                          * * *\n\nPeter Samson had been a member of the Tech Model Railroad Club\nsince his first week at MIT in the fall of 1958.  The first event\nthat entering MIT freshmen attended was a traditional welcoming\nlecture, the same one that had been given for as long as anyone\nat MIT could remember.  LOOK AT THE PERSON TO YOUR LEFT . . .\nLOOK AT THE PERSON TO YOUR RIGHT . . .  ONE OF YOU THREE WILL NOT\nGRADUATE FROM THE INSTITUTE.  The intended effect of the speech\nwas to create that horrid feeling in the back of the collective\nfreshman throat that signaled unprecedented dread.  All their\nlives, these freshmen had been almost exempt from academic\npressure.  The exemption had been earned by virtue of brilliance.\nNow each of them had a person to the right and a person to the\nleft who was just as smart.  Maybe even smarter.\n\nBut to certain students this was no challenge at all.  To these\nyoungsters, classmates were perceived in a sort of friendly haze:\nmaybe they would be of assistance in the consuming quest to find\nout how things worked, and then to master them.  There were\nenough obstacles to learning already--why bother with stupid\nthings like brown-nosing teachers and striving for grades?  To\nstudents like Peter Samson, the quest meant more than the degree.\n\nSometime after the lecture came Freshman Midway.  All the campus\norganizations--special-interest groups, fraternities, and such--\nset up booths in a large gymnasium to try to recruit new members.\nThe group that snagged Peter was the Tech Model Railroad Club.\nIts members, bright-eyed and crew-cutted upperclassmen who spoke\nwith the spasmodic cadences of people who want words out of the\nway in a hurry, boasted a spectacular display of HO gauge trains\nthey had in a permanent clubroom in Building 20.  Peter Samson\nhad long been fascinated by trains, especially subways.  So he\nwent along on the walking tour to the building, a shingle-clad\ntemporary structure built during World War II.  The hallways were\ncavernous, and even though the clubroom was on the second floor\nit had the dank, dimly lit feel of a basement.\n\nThe clubroom was dominated by the huge train layout.  It just\nabout filled the room, and if you stood in the little control\narea called \"the notch\" you could see a little town, a little\nindustrial area, a tiny working trolley line, a papier-mache\nmountain, and of course a lot of trains and tracks.  The trains\nwere meticulously crafted to resemble their full-scale\ncounterparts, and they chugged along the twists and turns of\ntrack with picture-book perfection.\n\nAnd then Peter Samson looked underneath the chest-high boards\nwhich held the layout.  It took his breath away.  Underneath this\nlayout was a more massive matrix of wires and relays,and crossbar\nswitches than Peter Samson had ever dreamed existed.  There were\nneat regimental lines of switches, and achingly regular rows of\ndull bronze relays, and a long, rambling tangle of red, blue, and\nyellow wires--twisting and twirling like a rainbow-colored\nexplosion of Einstein's hair.  It was an incredibly complicated\nsystem, and Peter Samson vowed to find out how it worked.\n\nThe Tech Model Railroad Club awarded its members a key to the\nclubroom after they logged forty hours of work on the layout.\nFreshman Midway had been on a Friday.  By Monday, Peter Samson\nhad his key.\n\n                     * * *\n\nThere were two factions of TMRC.  Some members loved the idea of\nspending their time building and painting replicas of certain\ntrains with historical and emotional value, or creating realistic\nscenery for the layout.  This was the knife-and-paintbrush\ncontingent, and it subscribed to railroad magazines and booked\nthe club for trips on aging train lines.  The other faction\ncentered on the Signals and Power Subcommittee of the club, and\nit cared far more about what went on under the layout.  This was\nThe System, which worked something like a collaboration between\nRube Goldberg and Wernher von Braun, and it was constantly being\nimproved, revamped, perfected, and sometimes \"gronked\"--in club\njargon, screwed up.  S&P people were obsessed with the way The\nSystem worked, its increasing complexities, how any change you\nmade would affect other parts, and how you could put those\nrelationships between the parts to optimal use.\n\nMany of the parts for The System had been donated by the Western\nElectric College Gift Plan, directly from the phone company.  The\nclub's faculty advisor was also in charge of the campus phone\nsystem, and had seen to it that sophisticated phone equipment was\navailable for the model railroaders.  Using that equipment as a\nstarting point, the Railroaders had devised a scheme which\nenabled several people to control trains at once, even if the\ntrains were at different parts of the same track.  Using dials\nappropriated from telephones, the TMRC \"engineers\" could specify\nwhich block of track they wanted control of, and run a train from\nthere.  This was done by using several types of phone company\nrelays, including crossbar executors and step switches which let\nyou actually hear the power being transferred from one block to\nanother by an other-worldly chunka-chunka-chunka sound.\n\nIt was the S&P group who devised this fiendishly ingenious\nscheme, and it was the S&P group who harbored the kind of\nrestless curiosity which led them to root around campus buildings\nin search of ways to get their hands on computers.  They were\nlifelong disciples of a Hands-On Imperative.  Head of S&P was an\nupperclassman named Bob Saunders, with ruddy, bulbous features,\nan infectious laugh, and a talent for switch gear.  As a child in\nChicago, he had built a high-frequency transformer for a high\nschool project; it was his six-foot-high version of a Tesla coil,\nsomething devised by an engineer in the 1800s which was supposed\nto send out furious waves of electrical power.  Saunders said his\ncoil project managed to blow out television reception for blocks\naround.  Another person who gravitated to S&P was Alan Kotok, a\nplump, chinless, thick-spectacled New Jerseyite in Samson's\nclass.  Kotok's family could recall him, at age three, prying a\nplug out of a wall with a screwdriver and causing a hissing\nshower of sparks to erupt.  When he was six, he was building and\nwiring lamps.  In high school he had once gone on a tour of the\nMobil Research Lab in nearby Haddonfield, and saw his first\ncomputer--the exhilaration of that experience helped him decide\nto enter MIT.  In his freshman year, he earned a reputation as\none of TMRC's most capable S&P people.\n\nThe S&P people were the ones who spent Saturdays going to Eli\nHeffron's junkyard in Somerville scrounging for parts, who would\nspend hours on their backs resting on little rolling chairs they\ncalled \"bunkies\" to get underneath tight spots in the switching\nsystem, who would work through the night making the wholly\nunauthorized connection between the TMRC phone and the East\nCampus.  Technology was their playground.\n\nThe core members hung out at the club for hours; constantly\nimproving The System, arguing about what could be done next,\ndeveloping a jargon of their own that seemed incomprehensible to\noutsiders who might chance on these teen-aged fanatics, with\ntheir checked short-sleeve shirts, pencils in their pockets,\nchino pants, and, always, a bottle of Coca-Cola by their side.\n(TMRC purchased its own Coke machine for the then forbidding sum\nof $165; at a tariff of five cents a bottle, the outlay was\nreplaced in three months; to facilitate sales, Saunders built a\nchange machine for Coke buyers that was still in use a decade\nlater.) When a piece of equipment wasn't working, it was\n\"losing\"; when a piece of equipment was ruined, it was \"munged\"\n(Mash Until No Good); the two desks in the corner of the room\nwere not called the office, but the \"orifice\"; one who insisted\non studying for courses was a \"tool\"; garbage was called \"cruft\";\nand a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill\nsome constructive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken in mere\ninvolvement, was called a \"hack.\"\n\nThis latter term may have been suggested by ancient MIT lingo--\nthe word \"hack\" had long been used to describe the elaborate\ncollege pranks that MIT students would regularly devise, such as\ncovering the dome that overlooked the campus with reflecting\nfoil.  But as the TMRC people used the word, there was serious\nrespect implied.  While someone might call a clever connection\nbetween relays a \"mere hack,\" it would be understood that, to\nqualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation,\nstyle, and technical virtuosity.  Even though one might\nself-deprecatingly say he was \"hacking away at The System\" (much\nas an axe-wielder hacks at logs), the artistry with which one\nhacked was recognized to be considerable.\n\nThe most productive people working on Signals and Power called\nthemselves \"hackers\" with great pride.  Within the confines of\nthe clubroom in Building 20, and of the \"Tool Room\" (where some\nstudy and many techno bull sessions took place), they had\nunilaterally endowed themselves with the heroic attributes of\nIcelandic legend.  This is how Peter Samson saw himself and his\nfriends in a Sandburg-esque poem in the club newsletter:\n\nSwitch Thrower for the World,\nFuze Tester, Maker of Routes,\nPlayer with the Railroads and the System's Advance Chopper;\nGrungy, hairy, sprawling,\nMachine of the Point-Function Line-o-lite:\nThey tell me you are wicked and I believe them; for I have seen\n            your painted light bulbs under the lucite luring\n            the system coolies . . .\nUnder the tower, dust all over the place, hacking with bifur-\n            cated springs . . .\nHacking even as an ignorant freshman acts who has never lost\n            occupancy and has dropped out\nHacking the M-Boards, for under its locks are the switches, and\n            under its control the advance around the layout,\n                      Hacking!\nHacking the grungy, hairy, sprawling hacks of youth; uncabled,\n            frying diodes, proud to be Switch-thrower, Fuze-\n            tester, Maker of Routes, Player with Railroads,\n            and Advance Chopper to the System.\n\nWhenever they could, Samson and the others would slip off to the\nEAM room with their plug boards, trying to use the machine to\nkeep track of the switches underneath the layout.  Just as\nimportant, they were seeing what the electromechanical counter\ncould do, taking it to its limit.\n\nThat spring of 1959, a new course was offered at MIT.  It was the\nfirst course in programming a computer that freshmen could take.\nThe teacher was a distant man with a wild shock of hair and an\nequally unruly beard--John McCarthy.  A master mathematician,\nMcCarthy was a classically absent-minded professor; stories\nabounded about his habit of suddenly answering a question hours,\nsometimes even days after it was first posed to him.  He would\napproach you in the hallway, and with no salutation would begin\nspeaking in his robotically precise diction, as if the pause in\nconversation had been only a fraction of a second, and not a\nweek.  Most likely, his belated response would be brilliant.\n\nMcCarthy was one of a very few people working in an entirely new\nform of scientific inquiry with computers.  The volatile and\ncontroversial nature of his field of study was obvious from the\nvery arrogance of the name that McCarthy had bestowed upon it:\nArtificial Intelligence.  This man actually thought that\ncomputers could be SMART.  Even at such a science-intensive place\nas MIT, most people considered the thought ridiculous: they\nconsidered computers to be useful, if somewhat absurdly\nexpensive, tools for number-crunching huge calculations and for\ndevising missile defense systems (as MIT's largest computer, the\nWhirlwind, had done for the early-warning SAGE system), but\nscoffed at the thought that computers themselves could actually\nbe a scientific field of study, Computer Science did not\nofficially exist at MIT in the late fifties, and McCarthy and his\nfellow computer specialists worked in the Electrical Engineering\nDepartment, which offered the course, No.  641, that Kotok,\nSamson, and a few other TRMC members took that spring.\n\nMcCarthy had started a mammoth program on the IBM 704--the\nHulking Giant--that would give it the extraordinary ability to\nplay chess.  To critics of the budding field of Artificial\nIntelligence, this was just one example of the boneheaded\noptimism of people like John McCarthy.  But McCarthy had a\ncertain vision of what computers could do, and playing chess was\nonly the beginning.\n\nAll fascinating stuff, but not the vision that was driving Kotok\nand Samson and the others.  They wanted to learn how to WORK the\ndamn machines, and while this new programming language called\nLISP that McCarthy was talking about in 641 was interesting, it\nwas not nearly as interesting as the act of programming, or that\nfantastic moment when you got your printout back from the\nPriesthood--word from the source itself!--and could then spend\nhours poring over the results of the program, what had gone wrong\nwith it, how it could be improved.  The TMRC hackers were\ndevising ways to get into closer contact with the IBM 704, which\nsoon was upgraded to a newer model called the 709.  By hanging\nout at the computation center in the wee hours of the morning,\nand by getting to know the Priesthood, and by bowing and scraping\nthe requisite number of times, people like Kotok were eventually\nallowed to push a few buttons on the machine, and watch the\nlights as it worked.\n\nThere were secrets to those IBM machines that had been\npainstakingly learned by some of the older people at MIT with\naccess to the 704 and friends among the Priesthood.  Amazingly, a\nfew of these programmers, grad students working with McCarthy,\nhad even written a program that utilized one of the rows of tiny\nlights:  the lights would be lit in such an order that it looked\nlike a little ball was being passed from right to left: if an\noperator hit a switch at just the right time, the motion of the\nlights could be reversed--Computer Ping-Pong!  This obviously was\nthe kind of thing that you'd show off to impress your peers, who\nwould then take a look at the actual program you had written and\nsee how it was done.\n\nTo top the program, someone else might try to do the same thing\nwith fewer instructions--a worthy endeavor, since there was so\nlittle room in the small \"memory\" of the computers of those days\nthat not many instructions could fit into them, John McCarthy had\nonce noticed how his graduate students who loitered around the\n704 would work over their computer programs to get the most out\nof the fewest instructions, and get the program compressed so\nthat fewer cards would need to be fed to the machine.  Shaving\noff an instruction or two was almost an obsession with them.\nMcCarthy compared these students to ski bums.  They got the same\nkind of primal thrill from \"maximizing code\" as fanatic skiers\ngot from swooshing frantically down a hill.  So the practice of\ntaking a computer program and trying to cut off instructions\nwithout affecting the outcome came to be called \"program\nbumming,\" and you would often hear people mumbling things like\n\"Maybe I can bum a few instructions out and get the octal\ncorrection card loader down to three cards instead of four.\"\n\nMcCarthy in 1959 was turning his interest from chess to a new way\nof talking to the computer, the whole new \"language\" called LISP.\nAlan Kotok and his friends were more than eager to take over the\nchess project.  Working on the batch-processed IBM, they embarked\non the gargantuan project of teaching the 704, and later the 709,\nand even after that its replacement the 7090, how to play the\ngame of kings.  Eventually Kotok's group became the largest users\nof computer time in the entire MIT computation center.\n\nStill, working with the IBM machine was frustrating.  There was\nnothing worse than the long wait between the time you handed in\nyour cards and the time your results were handed back to you.  If\nyou had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction, the\nprogram would crash, and you would have to start the whole\nprocess over again.  It went hand in hand with the stifling\nproliferation of goddamn RULES that permeated the atmosphere of\nthe computation center.  Most of the rules were designed to keep\ncrazy young computer fans like Samson and Kotok and Saunders\nphysically distant from the machine itself.  The most rigid rule\nof all was that no one should be able to actually touch or tamper\nwith the machine itself.  This, of course, was what those Signals\nand Power people were dying to do more than anything else in the\nworld, and the restrictions drove them mad.\n\nOne priest--a low-level sub-priest, really--on the late-night\nshift was particularly nasty in enforcing this rule, so Samson\ndevised a suitable revenge.  While poking around at Eli's\nelectronic junk shop one day, he chanced upon an electrical board\nprecisely like the kind of board holding the clunky vacuum tubes\nwhich resided inside the IBM.  One night, sometime before 4 A.M.,\nthis particular sub-priest stepped out for a minute; when he\nreturned, Samson told him that the machine wasn't working, but\nthey'd found the trouble--and held up the totally smashed module\nfrom the old 704 he'd gotten at Eli's.\n\nThe sub-priest could hardly get the words out.  \"W-where did you\nget that?\"\n\nSamson, who had wide green eyes that could easily look maniacal,\nslowly pointed to an open place on the machine rack where, of\ncourse, no board had ever been, but the space still looked sadly\nbare.  The sub-priest gasped.  He made faces that indicated his\nbowels were about to give out.  He whimpered exhortations to the\ndeity.  Visions, no doubt, of a million-dollar deduction from his\npaycheck began flashing before him.  Only after his supervisor, a\nhigh priest with some understanding of the mentality of these\nyoung wiseguys from the Model Railroad Club, came and explained\nthe situation did he calm down.\n\nHe was not the last administrator to feel the wrath of a hacker\nthwarted in the quest for access.\n\n                        * * *\n\nOne day a former TMRC member who was now on the MIT faculty paid\na visit to the clubroom.  His name was Jack Dennis.  When he had\nbeen an undergraduate in the early 1950s, he had worked furiously\nunderneath the layout.  Dennis lately had been working a computer\nwhich MIT had just received from Lincoln Lab, a military\ndevelopment laboratory affiliated with the Institute.  The\ncomputer was called the TX-0, and it was one of the first\ntransistor-run computers in the world.  Lincoln Lab had used it\nspecifically to test a giant computer called the TX-2, which had\na memory so complex that only with this specially built little\nbrother could its ills be capably diagnosed.  Now that its\noriginal job was over, the three-million-dollar TX-0 had been\nshipped over to the Institute on \"long-term loan,\" and apparently\nno one at Lincoln Lab had marked a calendar with a return date.\nDennis asked the S&P people at TMRC whether they would like to\nsee it.\n\nHey you nuns!  Would you like to meet the Pope?\n\nThe TX-0 was in Building 26, in the second-floor Radio Laboratory\nof Electronics (RLE), directly above the first-floor Computation\nCenter which housed the hulking IBM 704.  The RLE lab resembled\nthe control room of an antique spaceship.  The TX-0, or Tixo, as\nit was sometimes called, was for its time a midget machine, since\nit was one of the first computers to use finger-size transistors\ninstead of hand-size vacuum tubes.  Still, it took up much of the\nroom, along with its fifteen tons of supporting air-conditioning\nequipment.  The TX-O's workings were mounted on several tall,\nthin chassis, like rugged metal bookshelves, with tangled wires\nand neat little rows of tiny, bottle-like containers in which the\ntransistors were inserted.  Another rack had a solid metal front\nspeckled with grim-looking gauges.  Facing the racks was an\nL-shaped console, the control panel of this H. G. Wells\nspaceship, with a blue countertop for your elbows and papers.  On\nthe short arm of the L stood a Flexowriter, which resembled a\ntypewriter converted for tank warfare, its bottom anchored in a\nmilitary gray housing.  Above the top were the control panels,\nboxlike protrusions painted an institutional yellow.  On the\nsides of the boxes which faced the user were a few gauges,\nseveral lines of quarter-inch blinking lights, a matrix of steel\ntoggle switches the size of large grains of rice, and, best of\nall, an actual cathode ray tube display, round and smoke-gray.\n\nThe TMRC people were awed.  THIS MACHINE DID NOT USE CARDS.  The\nuser would first punch in a program onto a long, thin paper tape\nwith a Flexowriter (there were a few extra Flexowriters in an\nadjoining room), then sit at the console, feed in the program by\nrunning the tape through a reader, and be able to sit there while\nthe program ran.  If something went wrong with the program, you\nknew immediately, and you could diagnose the problem by using\nsome of the switches, or checking out which of the lights were\nblinking or lit.  The computer even had an audio output:  while\nthe program ran, a speaker underneath the console would make a\nsort of music, like a poorly tuned electric organ whose notes\nwould vibrate with a fuzzy, ethereal din.  The chords on this\n\"organ\" would change, depending on what data the machine was\nreading at any given microsecond; after you were familiar with\nthe tones, you could actually HEAR what part of your program the\ncomputer was working on.  You would have to discern this, though,\nover the clacking of the Flexowriter, which could make you think\nyou were in the middle of a machine-gun battle.  Even more\namazing was that, because of these \"interactive\" capabilities,\nand also because users seemed to be allowed blocks of time to use\nthe TX-0 all by themselves, you could even modify a program WHILE\nSITTING AT THE COMPUTER.  A miracle!\n\nThere was no way in hell that Kotok, Saunders, Samson, and the\nothers were going to be kept away from that machine.\nFortunately, there didn't seem to be the kind of bureaucracy\nsurrounding the TX-0 that there was around the IBM 704.  No cadre\nof officious priests.  The technician in charge was a canny\nwhite-haired Scotsman named John McKenzie.  While he made sure\nthat graduate students and those working on funded projects--\nOfficially Sanctioned Users--maintained access to the machine,\nMcKenzie tolerated the crew of TMRC madmen who began to hang out\nin the RLE lab, where the TX-0 stood.\n\nSamson, Kotok, Saunders, and a freshman named Bob Wagner soon\nfigured out that the best time of all to hang out in Building 26\nwas at night, when no person in his right mind would have signed\nup for an hour-long session on the piece of paper posted every\nFriday beside the air conditioner in the RLE lab.  The TX-0 as a\nrule was kept running twenty-four hours a day--computers back\nthen were too expensive for their time to be wasted by leaving\nthem idle through the night, and besides, it was a hairy\nprocedure to get the thing up and running once it was turned off.\nSo the TMRC hackers, who soon were referring to themselves as\nTX-0 hackers, changed their life-style to accommodate the\ncomputer.  They laid claim to what blocks of time they could, and\nwould \"vulture time\" with nocturnal visits to the lab on the off\nchance that someone who was scheduled for a 3 A.M. session might\nnot show up.\n\n\"Oh!\" Samson would say delightedly, a minute or so after someone\nfailed to show up at the time designated in the logbook.  \"Make\nsure it doesn't go to waste!\"\n\nIt never seemed to, because the hackers were there almost all the\ntime.  If they weren't in the RLE lab waiting for an opening to\noccur, they were in the classroom next to the TMRC clubroom, the\nTool Room, playing a \"hangman\"-style word game that Samson had\ndevised called \"Come Next Door,\" waiting for a call from someone\nwho was near the TX-0, monitoring it to see if someone had not\nshown up for a session.  The hackers recruited a network of\ninformers to give advance notice of potential openings at the\ncomputer--if a research project was not ready with its program in\ntime, or a professor was sick, the word would be passed to TMRC\nand the hackers would appear at the TX-0, breathless and ready to\njam into the space behind the console.\n\nThough Jack Dennis was theoretically in charge of the operation,\nDennis was teaching courses at the time, and preferred to spend\nthe rest of his time actually writing code for the machine.\nDennis played the role of benevolent godfather to the hackers:\nhe would give them a brief hands-on introduction to the machine,\npoint them in certain directions, be amused at their wild\nprogramming ventures.  He had little taste for administration,\nthough, and was just as happy to let John McKenzie run things.\nMcKenzie early on recognized that the interactive nature of the\nTX-0 was inspiring a new form of computer programming, and the\nhackers were its pioneers.  So he did not lay down too many\nedicts.\n\nThe atmosphere was loose enough in 1959 to accommodate the\nstrays--science-mad people whose curiosity burned like a hunger,\nwho like Peter Samson would be exploring the uncharted maze of\nlaboratories at MIT.  The noise of the air-conditioning, the\naudio output, and the drill-hammer Flexowriter would lure these\nwanderers, who'd poke their heads into the lab like kittens\npeering into baskets of yarn.\n\nOne of those wanderers was an outsider named Peter Deutsch.  Even\nbefore discovering the TX-0, Deutsch had developed a fascination\nfor computers.  It began one day when he picked up a manual that\nsomeone had discarded, a manual for an obscure form of computer\nlanguage for doing calculations.  Something about the orderliness\nof the computer instructions appealed to him: he would later\ndescribe the feeling as the same kind of eerily transcendent\nrecognition that an artist experiences when he discovers the\nmedium that is absolutely right for him.  THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.\nDeutsch tried writing a small program, and, signing up for time\nunder the name of one of the priests, ran it on a computer.\nWithin weeks, he had attained a striking proficiency in\nprogramming.  He was only twelve years old.\n\nHe was a shy kid, strong in math and unsure of most everything\nelse.  He was uncomfortably overweight, deficient in sports, but\nan intellectual star performer.  His father was a professor at\nMIT, and Peter used that as his entree to explore the labs.\n\nIt was inevitable that he would be drawn to the TX-0.  He first\nwandered into the small \"Kluge Room\" (a \"kluge\" is a piece of\ninelegantly constructed equipment that seems to defy logic by\nworking properly), where three off-line Flexowriters were\navailable for punching programs onto paper tape which would later\nbe fed into the TX-0.  Someone was busy punching in a tape.\nPeter watched for a while, then began bombarding the poor soul\nwith questions about that weird-looking little computer in the\nnext room.  Then Peter went up to the TX-0 itself, examined it\nclosely, noting how it differed from other computers: it was\nsmaller, had a CRT display, and other neat toys.  He decided\nright then to act as if he had a perfect right to be there.  He\ngot hold of a manual and soon was startling people by spouting\nactual make-sense computer talk, and eventually was allowed to\nsign up for night and weekend sessions, and to write his own\nprograms.\n\nMcKenzie worried that someone might accuse him of running some\nsort of summer camp, with this short-pants little kid, barely\ntall enough to stick his head over the TX-O's console, staring at\nthe code that an Officially Sanctioned User, perhaps some\nself-important graduate student, would be hammering into the\nFlexowriter, and saying in his squeaky, preadolescent voice\nsomething like \"Your problem is that this credit is wrong over\nhere . .  .  you need this other instruction over there,\" and the\nself-important grad student would go crazy--WHO IS THIS LITTLE\nWORM?--and start screaming at him to go out and play somewhere.\nInvariably, though, Peter Deutsch's comments would turn out to be\ncorrect.  Deutsch would also brazenly announce that he was going\nto write better programs than the ones currently available, and\nhe would go and do it.\n\nSamson, Kotok, and the other hackers accepted Peter Deutsch:  by\nvirtue of his computer knowledge he was worthy of equal\ntreatment.  Deutsch was not such a favorite with the Officially\nSanctioned Users, especially when he sat behind them ready to\nspring into action when they made a mistake on the Flexowriter.\nThese Officially Sanctioned Users appeared at the TX-0 with the\nregularity of commuters.  The programs they ran were statistical\nanalyses, cross correlations, simulations of an interior of the\nnucleus of a cell.  Applications.  That was fine for Users, but\nit was sort of a waste in the minds of the hackers.  What hackers\nhad in mind was getting behind the console of the TX-0 much in\nthe same way as getting in behind the throttle of a plane, Or, as\nPeter Samson, a classical music fan, put it, computing with the\nTX-0 was like playing a musical instrument:  an absurdly\nexpensive musical instrument upon which you could improvise,\ncompose, and, like the beatniks in Harvard Square a mile away,\nwail like a banshee with total creative abandon.\n\nOne thing that enabled them to do this was the programming system\ndevised by Jack Dennis and another professor, Tom Stockman.  When\nthe TX-0 arrived at MIT, it had been stripped down since its days\nat Lincoln Lab:  the memory had been reduced considerably, to\n4,096 \"words\" of eighteen bits each.  (A \"bit\" is a BInary digiT,\neither a one or zero.  These binary numbers are the only thing\ncomputers understand.  A series of binary numbers is called a\n\"word.\") And the TX-0 had almost no software.  So Jack Dennis,\neven before he introduced the TMRC people to the TX-0, had been\nwriting \"systems programs\"--the software to help users utilize\nthe machine.\n\nThe first thing Dennis worked on was an assembler.  This was\nsomething that translated assembly language--which used three-\nletter symbolic abbreviations that represented instructions to\nthe machine--into machine language, which consisted of the binary\nnumbers 0 and 1.  The TX-0 had a rather limited assembly\nlanguage: since its design allowed only two bits of each\neighteen-bit word to be used for instructions to the computer,\nonly four instructions could be used (each possible two-bit\nvariation--00, 0 1, 10, and 11--represented an instruction).\nEverything the computer did could be broken down to the execution\nof one of those four instructions:  it took one instruction to\nadd two numbers, but a series of perhaps twenty instructions to\nmultiply two numbers.  Staring at a long list of computer\ncommands written as binary numbers--for example, 10011001100001--\ncould make you into a babbling mental case in a matter of\nminutes.  But the same command in assembly language might look\nlike this:  ADD Y.  After loading the computer with the assembler\nthat Dennis wrote, you could write programs in this simpler\nsymbolic form, and wait smugly while the computer did the\ntranslation into binary for you, Then you'd feed that binary\n\"object\" code back into the computer.  The value of this was\nincalculable: it enabled programmers to write in something that\nLOOKED like code, rather than an endless, dizzying series of ones\nand zeros.\n\nThe other program that Dennis worked on with Stockman was\nsomething even newer--a debugger.  The TX-0 came with a debugging\nprogram called UT-3, which enabled you to talk to the computer\nwhile it was running by typing commands directly into the\nFlexowriter, But it had terrible problems-for one thing, it only\naccepted typed-in code that used the octal numeric system.\n\"Octal\" is a base-eight number system (as opposed to binary,\nwhich is base two, and Arabic--ours-which is base ten), and it is\na difficult system to use.  So Dennis and Stockman decided to\nwrite something better  than UT-3 which would enable users to use\nthe symbolic, easier-to-work-with assembly language.  This came\nto be called FLIT, and it allowed users to actually find program\nbugs during a session, fix them, and keep the program running.\n(Dennis would explain that \"FLIT\" stood for FLexowriter\nInterrogation Tape, but clearly the name's real origin was the\ninsect spray with that brand name.)  FLIT was a quantum leap\nforward, since it liberated programmers to actually do original\ncomposing on the machine--just like musicians composing on their\nmusical instruments.  With the use of the debugger, which took up\none third of the 4,096 words of the TX-O's memory, hackers were\nfree to create a new, more daring style of programming.\n\nAnd what did these hacker programs DO?  Well, sometimes, it\ndidn't matter much at all what they did.  Peter Samson hacked the\nnight away on a program that would instantly convert Arabic\nnumbers to Roman numerals, and Jack Dennis, after admiring the\nskill with which Samson had accomplished this feat, said, \"My\nGod, why would anyone want to do such a thing?\"  But Dennis knew\nwhy.  There was ample justification in the feeling of power and\naccomplishment Samson got when he fed in the paper tape,\nmonitored the lights and switches, and saw what were once plain\nold blackboard Arabic numbers coming back as the numerals the\nRomans had hacked with.\n\nIn fact it was Jack Dennis who suggested to Samson that there\nwere considerable uses for the TX-O's ability to send noise to\nthe audio speaker.  While there were no built-in controls for\npitch, amplitude, or tone character, there was a way to control\nthe speaker--sounds would be emitted depending on the state of\nthe fourteenth bit in the eighteen-bit words the TX-0 had in its\naccumulator in a given microsecond.  The sound was on or off\ndepending on whether bit fourteen was a one or zero.  So Samson\nset about writing programs that varied the binary numbers in that\nslot in different ways to produce different pitches.\n\nAt that time, only a few people in the country had been\nexperimenting with using a computer to output any kind of music,\nand the methods they had been using required massive computations\nbefore the machine would so much as utter a note, Samson, who\nreacted with impatience to those who warned he was attempting the\nimpossible, wanted a computer playing music right away.  So he\nlearned to control that one bit in the accumulator so adeptly\nthat he could command it with the authority of Charlie Parker on\nthe saxophone.  In a later version of this music compiler, Samson\nrigged it so that if you made an error in your programming\nsyntax, the Flexowriter would switch to a red ribbon and print\n\"To err is human to forgive divine.\"\n\nWhen outsiders heard the melodies of Johann Sebastian Bach in a\nsingle-voice, monophonic square wave, no harmony, they were\nuniversally unfazed.  Big deal!  Three million dollars for this\ngiant hunk of machinery, and why shouldn't it do at least as much\nas a five-dollar toy piano?  It was no use to explain to these\noutsiders that Peter Samson had virtually bypassed the process by\nwhich music had been made for eons.  Music had always been made\nby directly creating vibrations that were sound.  What happened\nin Samson's program was that a load of numbers, bits of\ninformation fed into a computer, comprised a code in which the\nmusic resided.  You could spend hours staring at the code, and\nnot be able to divine where the music was.  It only became music\nwhile millions of blindingly brief exchanges of data were taking\nplace in the accumulator sitting in one of the metal, wire, and\nsilicon racks that comprised the TX-0.  Samson had asked the\ncomputer, which had no apparent knowledge of how to use a voice,\nto lift itself in song--and the TX-0 had complied.\n\nSo it was that a computer program was not only metaphorically a\nmusical composition--it was LITERALLY a musical composition!  It\nlooked like--and was--the same kind of program which yielded\ncomplex arithmetical computations and statistical analyses.\nThese digits that Samson had jammed into the computer were a\nuniversal language which could produce ANYTHING--a Bach fugue or\nan anti-aircraft system.\n\nSamson did not say any of this to the outsiders who were\nunimpressed by his feat.  Nor did the hackers themselves discuss\nthis--it is not even clear that they analyzed the phenomenon in\nsuch cosmic terms.  Peter Samson did it, and his colleagues\nappreciated it, because it was obviously a neat hack.  That was\njustification enough.\n\n                        * * *\n\nTo hackers like Bob Saunders--balding, plump, and merry disciple\nof the TX-0, president of TMRC's S&P group, student of systems--\nit was a perfect existence.  Saunders had grown up in the suburbs\nof Chicago, and for as long as he could remember the workings of\nelectricity and telephone circuitry had fascinated him.  Before\nbeginning MIT, Saunders had landed a dream summer job, working\nfor the phone company installing central office equipment, He\nwould spend eight blissful hours with soldering iron and pliers\nin hand, working in the bowels of various systems, an idyll\nbroken by lunch hours spent in deep study of phone company\nmanuals.  It was the phone company equipment underneath the TMRC\nlayout that had convinced Saunders to become active in the Model\nRailroad Club.\n\nSaunders, being an upperclassman, had come to the TX-0 later in\nhis college career than Kotok and Samson:  he had used the\nbreathing space to actually lay the foundation for a social life,\nwhich included courtship of and eventual marriage to Marge\nFrench, who had done some non-hacking computer work for a\nresearch project.  Still, the TX-0 was the center of his college\ncareer, and he shared the common hacker experience of seeing his\ngrades suffer from missed classes.  It didn't bother him much,\nbecause he knew that his real education was occurring in Room 240\nof Building 26, behind the Tixo console.  Years later he would\ndescribe himself and the others as \"an elite group.  Other people\nwere off studying, spending their days up on four-floor buildings\nmaking obnoxious vapors or off in the physics lab throwing\nparticles at things or whatever it is they do.  And we were\nsimply not paying attention to what other folks were doing\nbecause we had no interest in it.  They were studying what they\nwere studying and we were studying what we were studying.  And\nthe fact that much of it was not on the officially approved\ncurriculum was by and large immaterial.\"\n\nThe hackers came out at night.  It was the only way to take full\nadvantage of the crucial \"off-hours\" of the TX-0.  During the\nday, Saunders would usually manage to make an appearance in a\nclass or two.  Then some time spent performing \"basic\nmaintenance\"--things like eating and going to the bathroom.  He\nmight see Marge for a while.  But eventually he would filter over\nto Building 26.  He would go over some of the programs of the\nnight before, printed on the nine-and-a-half-inch-wide paper that\nthe Flexowriter used.  He would annotate and modify the listing\nto update the code to whatever he considered the next stage of\noperation.  Maybe then he would move over to the Model Railroad\nClub, and he'd swap his program with someone, checking\nsimultaneously for good ideas and potential bugs.  Then back to\nBuilding 26, to the Kluge Room next to the TX-0, to find an\noff-line Flexowriter on which to update his code.  All the while\nhe'd be checking to see if someone had canceled a one-hour\nsession on the machine; his own session was scheduled at\nsomething like two or three in the morning.  He'd wait in the\nKluge Room, or play some bridge back at the Railroad Club, until\nthe time came.\n\nSitting at the console, facing the metal racks that held the\ncomputer's transistors, each transistor representing a location\nthat either held or did not hold a bit of memory, Saunders would\nset up the Flexowriter, which would greet him with the word\n\"WALRUS.\"  This was something Samson had hacked, in honor of\nLewis Carroll's poem with the line \"The time has come, the Walrus\nsaid . . .\"  Saunders might chuckle at that as he went into the\ndrawer for the paper tape which held the assembler program and\nfed that into the tape reader.  Now the computer would be ready\nto assemble his program, so he'd take the Flexowriter tape he'd\nbeen working on and send that into the computer.  He'd watch the\nlights go on as the computer switched his code from \"source\" (the\nsymbolic assembly language) to \"object\" code (binary), which the\ncomputer would punch out into another paper tape.  Since that\ntape was in the object code that the TX-0 understood, he'd feed\nit in, hoping that the program would run magnificently.\n\nThere would most probably be a few fellow hackers kibitzing\nbehind him, laughing and joking and drinking Cokes and eating\nsome junk food they'd extracted from the machine downstairs.\nSaunders preferred the lemon jelly wedges that the others called\n\"lemon gunkies.\"  But at four in the morning, anything tasted\ngood.  They would all watch as the program began to run, the\nlights going on, the whine from the speaker humming in high or\nlow register depending on what was in Bit 14 in the accumulator,\nand the first thing he'd see on the CRT display after the program\nhad been assembled and run was that the program had crashed.  So\nhe'd reach into the drawer for the tape with the FLIT debugger\nand feed THAT into the computer.  The computer would then be a\ndebugging machine, and he'd send the program back in.  Now he\ncould start trying to find out where things had gone wrong, and\nmaybe if he was lucky he'd find out, and change things by putting\nin some commands by flicking some of the switches on the console\nin precise order, or hammering in some code on the Flexowriter.\nOnce things got running--and it was always incredibly satisfying\nwhen something worked, when he'd made that roomful of transistors\nand wires and metal and electricity all meld together to create a\nprecise output that he'd devised--he'd try to add the next\nadvance to it.  When the hour was over--someone already itching\nto get on the machine after him--Saunders would be ready to spend\nthe next few hours figuring out what the heck had made the\nprogram go belly-up.\n\nThe peak hour itself was tremendously intense, but during the\nhours before, and even during the hours afterward, a hacker\nattained a state of pure concentration.  When you programmed a\ncomputer, you had to be aware of where all the thousands of bits\nof information were going from one instruction to the next, and\nbe able to predict--and exploit--the effect of all that movement.\nWhen you had all that information glued to your cerebral being,\nit was almost as if your own mind had merged into the environment\nof the computer.  Sometimes it took hours to build up to the\npoint where your thoughts could contain that total picture, and\nwhen you did get to that point, it was such a shame to waste it\nthat you tried to sustain it by marathon bursts, alternatively\nworking on the computer or poring over the code that you wrote on\none of the off-line Flexowriters in the Kluge Room.  You would\nsustain that concentration by \"wrapping around\" to the next day.\n\nInevitably, that frame of mind spilled over to what random shards\nof existence the hackers had outside of computing.  The\nknife-and-paintbrush contingent at TMRC were not pleased at all\nby the infiltration of Tixo-mania into the club:  they saw it as\na sort of Trojan horse for a switch in the club focus, from\nrailroading to computing.  And if you attended one of the club\nmeetings held every Tuesday at five-fifteen, you could see the\nconcern:  the hackers would exploit every possible thread of\nparliamentary procedure to create a meeting as convoluted as the\nprograms they were hacking on the TX-0.  Motions were made to\nmake motions to make motions, and objections ruled out of order\nas if they were so many computer errors.  A note in the minutes\nof the meeting on November 24, 1959, suggests that \"we frown on\ncertain members who would do the club a lot more good by doing\nmore S&P-ing and less reading Robert's Rules of Order.\"  Samson\nwas one of the worst offenders, and at one point, an exasperated\nTMRC member made a motion \"to purchase a cork for Samson's oral\ndiarrhea.\"\n\nHacking parliamentary procedure was one thing, but the logical\nmind-frame required for programming spilled over into more\ncommonplace activities.  You could ask a hacker a question and\nsense his mental accumulator processing bits until he came up\nwith a precise answer to the question you asked.  Marge Saunders\nwould drive to the Safeway every Saturday morning in the\nVolkswagen and upon her return ask her husband, \"Would you like\nto help me bring in the groceries?\"  Bob Saunders would reply,\n\"No.\"  Stunned, Marge would drag in the groceries herself.  After\nthe same thing occurred a few times, she exploded, hurling curses\nat him and demanding to know why he said no to her question.\n\n\"That's a stupid question to ask,\" he said.  \"Of course I won't\nLIKE to help you bring in the groceries.  If you ask me if I'll\nhelp you bring them in, that's another matter.\"\n\nIt was as if Marge had submitted a program into the TX-0, and the\nprogram, as programs do when the syntax is improper, had crashed.\nIt was not until she debugged her question that Bob Saunders\nwould allow it to run successfully on his own mental computer.\n\n\nCHAPTER  2\nTHE HACKER ETHIC\n\nSomething new was coalescing around the TX-0:  a new way of life,\nwith a philosophy, an ethic, and a dream.\n\nThere was no one moment when it started to dawn on the TX-0\nhackers that by devoting their technical abilities to computing\nwith a devotion rarely seen outside of monasteries they were the\nvanguard of a daring symbiosis between man and machine.  With a\nfervor like that of young hot-rodders fixated on souping up\nengines, they came to take their almost unique surroundings for\ngranted, Even as the elements of a culture were forming, as\nlegends began to accrue, as their mastery of programming started\nto surpass any previous recorded levels of skill, the dozen or so\nhackers were reluctant to acknowledge that their tiny society, on\nintimate terms with the TX-0, had been slowly and implicitly\npiecing together a body of concepts, beliefs, and mores.\n\nThe precepts of this revolutionary Hacker Ethic were not so much\ndebated and discussed as silently agreed upon.  No manifestos\nwere issued.  No missionaries tried to gather converts.  The\ncomputer did the converting, and those who seemed to follow the\nHacker Ethic most faithfully were people like Samson, Saunders,\nand Kotok, whose lives before MIT seemed to be mere preludes to\nthat moment when they fulfilled themselves behind the console of\nthe TX-0.  Later there would come hackers who took the implicit\nEthic even more seriously than the TX-0 hackers did, hackers like\nthe legendary Greenblatt or Gosper, though it would be some years\nyet before the tenets of hackerism would be explicitly\ndelineated.\n\nStill, even in the days of the TX-0, the planks of the platform\nwere in place.  The Hacker Ethic:\n\nACCESS TO COMPUTERS--AND ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT TEACH YOU SOMETHING\nABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS--SHOULD BE UNLIMITED AND TOTAL.\nALWAYS YIELD TO THE HANDS-ON IMPERATIVE!\n\nHackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the\nsystems--about the world--from taking things apart, seeing how\nthey work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more\ninteresting things.  They resent any person, physical barrier, or\nlaw that tries to keep them from doing this.\n\nThis is especially true when a hacker wants to fix something that\n(from his point of view) is broken or needs improvement.\nImperfect systems infuriate hackers, whose primal instinct is to\ndebug them.  This is one reason why hackers generally hate\ndriving cars--the system of randomly programmed red lights and\noddly laid out one-way streets causes delays which are so\ngoddamned UNNECESSARY that the impulse is to rearrange signs,\nopen up traffic-light control boxes . . .redesign the entire\nsystem.\n\nIn a perfect hacker world, anyone pissed off enough to open up a\ncontrol box near a traffic light and take it apart to make it\nwork better should be perfectly welcome to make the attempt.\nRules which prevent you from taking matters like that into your\nown hands are too ridiculous to even consider abiding by.  This\nattitude helped the Model Railroad Club start, on an extremely\ninformal basis, something called the Midnight Requisitioning\nCommittee.  When TMRC needed a set of diodes, or some extra\nrelays, to build some new feature into The System, a few S&P\npeople would wait until dark and find their way into the places\nwhere those things were kept.  None of the hackers, who were as a\nrule scrupulously honest in other matters, seemed to equate this\nwith \"stealing.\"  A willful blindness.\n\nALL INFORMATION SHOULD BE FREE.\n\nIf you don't have access to the information you need to improve\nthings, how can you fix them?  A free exchange of information\nparticularly when the information was in the form of a computer\nprogram, allowed for greater overall creativity.  When you were\nworking on a machine like the TX-0, which came with almost no\nsoftware, everyone would furiously write systems programs to make\nprogramming easier--Tools to Make Tools, kept in the drawer by\nthe console for easy access by anyone using the machine.  This\nprevented the dread, time-wasting ritual of reinventing the\nwheel: instead of everybody writing his own version of the same\nprogram, the best version would be available to everyone, and\neveryone would be free to delve into the code and improve on\nTHAT.  A world studded with feature-full programs, bummed to the\nminimum, debugged to perfection.\n\nThe belief, sometimes taken unconditionally, that information\nshould be free was a direct tribute to the way a splendid\ncomputer, or computer program, works--the binary bits moving in\nthe most straightforward, logical path necessary to do their\ncomplex job, What was a computer but something which benefited\nfrom a free flow of information?  If, say, the accumulator found\nitself unable to get information from the input/output (i/o)\ndevices like the tape reader or the switches, the whole system\nwould collapse.  In the hacker viewpoint, any system could\nbenefit from that easy flow of information.\n\nMISTRUST AUTHORITY--PROMOTE DECENTRALIZATION.\n\nThe best way to promote this free exchange of information is to\nhave an open system, something which presents no boundaries\nbetween a hacker and a piece of information or an item of\nequipment that he needs in his quest for knowledge, improvement,\nand time on-line.  The last thing you need is a bureaucracy.\nBureaucracies, whether corporate, government, or university, are\nflawed systems, dangerous in that they cannot accommodate the\nexploratory impulse of true hackers.  Bureaucrats hide behind\narbitrary rules (as opposed to the logical algorithms by which\nmachines and computer programs operate):  they invoke those rules\nto consolidate power, and perceive the constructive impulse of\nhackers as a threat.\n\nThe epitome of the bureaucratic world was to be found at a very\nlarge company called International Business Machines--IBM.  The\nreason its computers were batch-processed Hulking Giants was only\npartially because of vacuum tube technology, The real reason was\nthat IBM was a clumsy, hulking company which did not understand\nthe hacking impulse.  If IBM had its way (so the TMRC hackers\nthought), the world would be batch-processed, laid out on those\nannoying little punch cards, and only the most privileged of\npriests would be permitted to actually interact with the\ncomputer.\n\nAll you had to do was look at someone in the IBM world, and note\nthe button-down white shirt, the neatly pinned black tie, the\nhair carefully held in place, and the tray of punch cards in\nhand.  You could wander into the Computation Center, where the\n704, the 709, and later the 7090 were stored--the best IBM had to\noffer--and see the stifling orderliness, down to the roped-off\nareas beyond which non-authorized people could not venture.  And\nyou could compare that to the extremely informal atmosphere\naround the TX-0, where grungy clothes were the norm and almost\nanyone could wander in.\n\nNow, IBM had done and would continue to do many things to advance\ncomputing.  By its sheer size and mighty influence, it had made\ncomputers a permanent part of life in America.  To many people,\nthe words IBM and computer were virtually synonymous.  IBM's\nmachines were reliable workhorses, worthy of the trust that\nbusinessmen and scientists invested in them.  This was due in\npart to IBM's conservative approach: it would not make the most\ntechnologically advanced machines, but would rely on proven\nconcepts and careful, aggressive marketing.  As IBM's dominance\nof the computer field was established, the company became an\nempire unto itself, secretive and smug.\n\nWhat really drove the hackers crazy was the attitude of the IBM\npriests and sub-priests, who seemed to think that IBM had the\nonly \"real\" computers, and the rest were all trash.  You couldn't\ntalk to those people--they were beyond convincing.  They were\nbatch-processed people, and it showed not only in their\npreference of machines, but in their idea about the way a\ncomputation center, and a world, should be run.  Those people\ncould never understand the obvious superiority of a decentralized\nsystem, with no one giving orders: a system where people could\nfollow their interests, and if along the way they discovered a\nflaw in the system, they could embark on ambitious surgery.  No\nneed to get a requisition form.  just a need to get something\ndone.\n\nThis antibureaucratic bent coincided neatly with the\npersonalities of many of the hackers, who since childhood had\ngrown accustomed to building science projects while the rest of\ntheir classmates were banging their heads together and learning\nsocial skills on the field of sport.  These young adults who were\nonce outcasts found the computer a fantastic equalizer,\nexperiencing a feeling, according to Peter Samson, \"like you\nopened the door and walked through this grand new universe . . .\"\nOnce they passed through that door and sat behind the console of\na million-dollar computer, hackers had power.  So it was natural\nto distrust any force which might try to limit the extent of that\npower.\n\nHACKERS SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THEIR HACKING, NOT BOGUS CRITERIA\nSUCH AS DEGREES, AGE, RACE, OR POSITION.\n\nThe ready acceptance of twelve-year-old Peter Deutsch in the TX-0\ncommunity (though not by non-hacker graduate students) was a good\nexample.  Likewise, people who trotted in with seemingly\nimpressive credentials were not taken seriously until they proved\nthemselves at the console of a computer.  This meritocratic trait\nwas not necessarily rooted in the inherent goodness of hacker\nhearts--it was mainly that hackers cared less about someone's\nsuperficial characteristics than they did about his potential to\nadvance the general state of hacking, to create new programs to\nadmire, to talk about that new feature in the system.\n\nYOU CAN CREATE ART AND BEAUTY ON A COMPUTER.\n\nSamson's music program was an example.  But to hackers, the art\nof the program did not reside in the pleasing sounds emanating\nfrom the on-line speaker.  The code of the program held a beauty\nof its own.  (Samson, though, was particularly obscure in\nrefusing to add comments to his source code explaining what he\nwas doing at a given time.  One well-distributed program Samson\nwrote went on for hundreds of assembly language instructions,\nwith only one comment beside an instruction which contained the\nnumber 1750.  The comment was RIPJSB, and people racked their\nbrains about its meaning until someone figured out that 1750 was\nthe year Bach died, and that Samson had written an abbreviation\nfor Rest In Peace Johann Sebastian Bach.)\n\nA certain esthetic of programming style had emerged.  Because of\nthe limited memory space of the TX-0 (a handicap that extended to\nall computers of that era), hackers came to deeply appreciate\ninnovative techniques which allowed programs to do complicated\ntasks with very few instructions.  The shorter a program was, the\nmore space you had left for other programs, and the faster a\nprogram ran.  Sometimes when you didn't need speed or space much,\nand you weren't thinking about art and beauty, you'd hack\ntogether an ugly program, attacking the problem with \"brute\nforce\" methods.  \"Well, we can do this by adding twenty numbers,\"\nSamson might say to himself, \"and it's quicker to write\ninstructions to do that than to think out a loop in the beginning\nand the end to do the same job in seven or eight instructions.\"\nBut the latter program might be admired by fellow hackers, and\nsome programs were bummed to the fewest lines so artfully that\nthe author's peers would look at it and almost melt with awe.\n\nSometimes program bumming became competitive, a macho contest to\nprove oneself so much in command of the system that one could\nrecognize elegant shortcuts to shave off an instruction or two,\nor, better yet, rethink the whole problem and devise a new\nalgorithm which would save a whole block of instructions.  (An\nalgorithm is a specific procedure which one can apply to solve a\ncomplex computer problem; it is sort of a mathematical skeleton\nkey.) This could most emphatically be done by approaching the\nproblem from an offbeat angle that no one had ever thought of\nbefore but that in retrospect made total sense.  There was\ndefinitely an artistic impulse residing in those who could\nutilize this genius-from-Mars techniques black-magic, visionary\nquality which enabled them to discard the stale outlook of the\nbest minds on earth and come up with a totally unexpected new\nalgorithm.\n\nThis happened with the decimal print routine program.  This was a\nsubroutines program within a program that you could sometimes\nintegrate into many different programs--to translate binary\nnumbers that the computer gave you into regular decimal numbers.\nIn Saunders' words, this problem became the \"pawn's ass of\nprogramming--if you could write a decimal print routine which\nworked you knew enough about the computer to call yourself a\nprogrammer of sorts.\"  And if you wrote a GREAT decimal print\nroutine, you might be able to call yourself a hacker.  More than\na competition, the ultimate bumming of the decimal print routine\nbecame a sort of hacker Holy Grail.\n\nVarious versions of decimal print routines had been around for\nsome months.  If you were being deliberately stupid about it, or\nif you were a genuine moron--an out-and-out \"loser\"--it might\ntake you a hundred instructions to get the computer to convert\nmachine language to decimal.  But any hacker worth his salt could\ndo it in less, and finally, by taking the best of the programs,\nbumming an instruction here and there, the routine was diminished\nto about fifty instructions.\n\nAfter that, things got serious.  People would work for hours,\nseeking a way to do the same thing in fewer lines of code.  It\nbecame more than a competition; it was a quest.  For all the\neffort expended, no one seemed to be able to crack the fifty-line\nbarrier.  The question arose whether it was even possible to do\nit in less.  Was there a point beyond which a program could not\nbe bummed?\n\nAmong the people puzzling with this dilemma was a fellow named\nJenson, a tall, silent hacker from Maine who would sit quietly in\nthe Kluge Room and scribble on printouts with the calm demeanor\nof a backwoodsman whittling.  Jenson was always looking for ways\nto compress his programs in time and space--his code was a\ncompletely bizarre sequence of intermingled Boolean and\narithmetic functions, often causing several different\ncomputations to occur in different sections of the same\neighteen-bit \"word.\"  Amazing things, magical stunts.\n\nBefore Jenson, there had been general agreement that the only\nlogical algorithm for a decimal print routine would have the\nmachine repeatedly subtracting, using a table of the powers of\nten to keep the numbers in proper digital columns.  Jenson\nsomehow figured that a powers-of-ten table wasn't necessary; he\ncame up with an algorithm that was able to convert the digits in\na reverse order but, by some digital sleight of hand, print them\nout in the proper order.  There was a complex mathematical\njustification to it that was clear to the other hackers only when\nthey saw Jenson's program posted on a bulletin board, his way of\ntelling them that he had taken the decimal print routine to its\nlimit.  FORTY-SIX INSTRUCTIONS.  People would stare at the code\nand their jaws would drop.  Marge Saunders remembers the hackers\nbeing unusually quiet for days afterward.\n\n\"We knew that was the end of it,\" Bob Saunders later said.  \"That\nwas Nirvana.\"\n\nCOMPUTERS CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOR THE BETTER.\n\nThis belief was subtly manifest.  Rarely would a hacker try to\nimpose a view of the myriad advantages of the computer way of\nknowledge to an outsider.  Yet this premise dominated the\neveryday behavior of the TX-0 hackers, as well as the generations\nof hackers that came after them.\n\nSurely the computer had changed THEIR lives, enriched their\nlives, given their lives focus, made their lives adventurous.  It\nhad made them masters of a certain slice of fate.  Peter Samson\nlater said, \"We did it twenty-five to thirty percent for the sake\nof doing it because it was something we could do and do well, and\nsixty percent for the sake of having something which was in its\nmetaphorical way alive, our offspring, which would do things on\nits own when we were finished.  That's the great thing about\nprogramming, the magical appeal it has . . .  Once you fix a\nbehavioral problem [a computer or program] has, it's fixed\nforever, and it is exactly an image of what you meant.\"\n\nLIKE ALADDIN'S LAMP, YOU COULD GET IT TO DO YOUR BIDDING.\n\nSurely everyone could benefit from experiencing this power.\nSurely everyone could benefit from a world based on the Hacker\nEthic.  This was the implicit belief of the hackers, and the\nhackers irreverently extended the conventional point of view of\nwhat computers could and should do--leading the world to a new\nway of looking and interacting with computers.\n\nThis was not easily done.  Even at such an advanced institution\nas MIT, some professors considered a manic affinity for computers\nas frivolous, even demented.  TMRC hacker Bob Wagner once had to\nexplain to an engineering professor what a computer was.  Wagner\nexperienced this clash of computer versus anti-computer even more\nvividly when he took a Numerical Analysis class in which the\nprofessor required each student to do homework using rattling,\nclunky electromechanical calculators.  Kotok was in the same\nclass, and both of them were appalled at the prospect of working\nwith those lo-tech machines.  \"Why should we,\" they asked, \"when\nwe've got this computer?\"\n\nSo Wagner began working on a computer program that would emulate\nthe behavior of a calculator.  The idea was outrageous.  To some,\nit was a misappropriation of valuable machine time.  According to\nthe standard thinking on computers, their time was too precious\nthat one should only attempt things which took maximum advantage\nof the computer, things that otherwise would take roomfuls of\nmathematicians days of mindless calculating.  Hackers felt\notherwise: anything that seemed interesting or fun was fodder for\ncomputing--and using interactive computers, with no one looking\nover your shoulder and demanding clearance for your specific\nproject, you could act on that belief.  After two or three months\nof tangling with intricacies of floating-point arithmetic\n(necessary to allow the program to know where to place the\ndecimal point) on a machine that had no simple method to perform\nelementary multiplication, Wagner had written three thousand\nlines of code that did the job.  He had made a ridiculously\nexpensive computer perform the function of a calculator that cost\na thousand times less.  To honor this irony, he called the\nprogram Expensive Desk Calculator, and proudly did the homework\nfor his class on it.\n\nHis grade--zero.  \"You used a computer!\" the professor told him.\n\"This CAN'T be right.\"\n\nWagner didn't even bother to explain.  How could he convey to his\nteacher that the computer was making realities out of what were\nonce incredible possibilities?  Or that another hacker had even\nwritten a program called Expensive Typewriter that converted the\nTX-0 to something you could write text on, could process your\nwriting in strings of characters and print it out on the\nFlexowriter--could you imagine a professor accepting a classwork\nreport WRITTEN BY THE COMPUTER?  How could that professor--how\ncould, in fact, anyone who hadn't been immersed in this uncharted\nman-machine universe--understand how Wagner and his fellow\nhackers were routinely using the computer to simulate, according\nto Wagner, \"strange situations which one could scarcely envision\notherwise\"?  The professor would learn in time, as would\neveryone, that the world opened up by the computer was a\nlimitless one.\n\nIf anyone needed further proof, you could cite the project that\nKotok was working on in the Computation Center, the chess program\nthat bearded Al professor \"Uncle\" John McCarthy, as he was\nbecoming known to his hacker students, had begun on the IBM 704.\nEven though Kotok and the several other hackers helping him on\nthe program had only contempt for the IBM batch-processing\nmentality that pervaded the machine and the people around it,\nthey had managed to scrounge some late-night time to use it\ninteractively, and had been engaging in an informal battle with\nthe systems programmers on the 704 to see which group would be\nknown as the biggest consumer of computer time.  The lead would\nbounce back and forth, and the white-shirt-and-black-tie 704\npeople were impressed enough to actually let Kotok and his group\ntouch the buttons and switches on the 704:  rare sensual contact\nwith a vaunted IBM beast.\n\nKotok's role in bringing the chess program to life was indicative\nof what was to become the hacker role in Artificial Intelligence:\na Heavy Head like McCarthy or like his colleague Marvin Minsky\nwould begin a project or wonder aloud whether something might be\npossible, and the hackers, if it interested them, would set about\ndoing it.\n\nThe chess program had been started using FORTRAN, one of the\nearly computer languages.  Computer languages look more like\nEnglish than assembly language, are easier to write with, and do\nmore things with fewer instructions; however, each time an\ninstruction is given in a computer language like FORTRAN, the\ncomputer must first translate that command into its own binary\nlanguage.  A program called a compiler does this, and the\ncompiler takes up time to do its job, as well as occupying\nvaluable space within the computer.  In effect, using a computer\nlanguage puts you an extra step away from direct contact with the\ncomputer, and hackers generally preferred assembly or, as they\ncalled it, \"machine\" language to less elegant, \"higher-level\"\nlanguages like FORTRAN.\n\nKotok, though, recognized that because of the huge amounts of\nnumbers that would have to be crunched in a chess program, part\nof the program would have to be done in FORTRAN, and part in\nassembly.  They hacked it part by part, with \"move generators,\"\nbasic data structures, and all kinds of innovative algorithms for\nstrategy.  After feeding the machine the rules for moving each\npiece, they gave it some parameters by which to evaluate its\nposition, consider various moves, and make the move which would\nadvance it to the most advantageous situation.  Kotok kept at it\nfor years, the program growing as MIT kept upgrading its IBM\ncomputers, and one memorable night a few hackers gathered to see\nthe program make some of its first moves in a real game.  Its opener\nwas quite respectable, but after eight or so exchanges there was real\ntrouble, with the computer about to be checkmated.  Everybody\nwondered how the computer would react.  It too a while (everyone\nknew that during those pauses the computer was actually \"thinking,\"\nif your idea of thinking included mechanically considering\nvarious moves, evaluating them, rejecting most, and using a\npredefined set of parameters to ultimately make a choice).  Finally,\nthe computer moved a pawn two squares forward--illegally jumping\nover another piece.  A bug!  But a clever one--it got the computer\nout of check.  Maybe the program was figuring out some new\nalgorithm with which to conquer chess.\n\nAt other universities, professors were making public proclamations\nthat computers would never be able to beat a human being in chess.\nHackers knew better.  They would be the ones who would guide\ncomputers to greater heights than anyone expected.  And the hackers,\nby fruitful, meaningful association with the computer, would be\nforemost among the beneficiaries.\n\nBut they would not be the only beneficiaries.  Everyone could gain\nsomething by the use of thinking computers in an intellectually\nautomated world.  And wouldn't everyone benefit even more by\napproaching the world with the same inquisitive intensity,\nskepticism toward bureaucracy, openness to creativity,\nunselfishness in sharing accomplishments, urge to make improvements,\nand desire to build as those who followed the Hacker Ethic?\nBy accepting others on the same unprejudiced basis by which\ncomputers accepted anyone who entered code into a Flexowriter?\nWouldn't we benefit if we learned from computers the means of\ncreating a perfect system?  If EVERYONE could interact with\ncomputers with the same innocent, productive, creative impulse\nthat hackers did, the Hacker Ethic might spread through society\nlike a benevolent ripple, and computers would indeed change\nthe world for the better.\n\nIn the monastic confines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\npeople had the freedom to live out this dream--the hacker dream.\nNo one dared suggest that the dream might spread.  Instead, people\nset about building, right there at MIT, a hacker Xanadu the likes\nof which might never be duplicated.\n\n\n\n\n\nHackers, Heroes of the Computer Revolution, by Steven Levy\n(C)1984 by Steven Levy\n\n",

It was plain that the spot belonged both to the\neye and to the blue part of the spectrum.  The result to which I have\ncome is, that the appearance is due to the yellow spot on the retina,\ncommonly called the _Foramen Centrale_ of Soemmering.  The most\nconvenient method of observing the spot is by presenting to the eye in\nnot too rapid succession, blue and yellow glasses, or, still better,\nallowing blue and yellow papers to revolve slowly before the eye.  In\nthis way the spot is seen in the blue.  It fades rapidly, but is\nrenewed every time the yellow comes in to relieve the effect of the\nblue.  By using a Nicol's prism along with this apparatus, the brushes\nof Haidinger are well seen in connexion with the spot, and the fact of\nthe brushes being the spot analysed by polarized light becomes\nevident.  If we look steadily at an object behind a series of bright\nbars which move in front of it, we shall see a curious bending of the\nbars as they come up to the place of the yellow spot.  The part which\ncomes over the spot seems to start in advance of the rest of the bar,\nand this would seem to indicate a greater rapidity of sensation at the\nyellow spot than in the surrounding retina.  But I find the experiment\ndifficult, and I hope for better results from more accurate observers.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Theory of Compound Colours with reference to Mixtures of\nBlue and Yellow Light.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n\n\n[From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]\n\n\nWhen we mix together blue and yellow paint, we obtain green paint.\nThis fact is well known to all who have handled colours; and it is\nuniversally admitted that blue and yellow make green.  Red, yellow,\nand blue, being the primary colours among painters, green is regarded\nas a secondary colour, arising from the mixture of blue and yellow.\nNewton, however, found that the green of the spectrum was not the same\nthing as the mixture of two colours of the spectrum, for such a\nmixture could be separated by the prism, while the green of the\nspectrum resisted further decomposition.  But still it was believed\nthat yellow and blue would make a green, though not that of the\nspectrum.  As far as I am aware, the first experiment on the subject\nis that of M. Plateau, who, before 1819, made a disc with alternate\nsectors of prussian blue and gamboge, and observed that, when\nspinning, the resultant tint was not green, but a neutral gray,\ninclining sometimes to yellow or blue, but never to green.\nProf. J. D. Forbes of Edinburgh made similar experiments in 1849, with\nthe same result.  Prof. Helmholtz of Konigsberg, to whom we owe the\nmost complete investigation on visible colour, has given the true\nexplanation of this phenomenon.  The result of mixing two coloured\npowders is not by any means the same as mixing the beams of light\nwhich flow from each separately.  In the latter case we receive all\nthe light which comes either from the one powder or the other.  In the\nformer, much of the light coming from one powder falls on particles of\nthe other, and we receive only that portion which has escaped\nabsorption by one or other.  Thus the light coming from a mixture of\nblue and yellow powder, consists partly of light coming directly from\nblue particles or yellow particles, and partly of light acted on by\nboth blue and yellow particles.  This latter light is green, since the\nblue stops the red, yellow, and orange, and the yellow stops the blue\nand violet.  I have made experiments on the mixture of blue and yellow\nlight--by rapid rotation, by combined reflexion and transmission, by\nviewing them out of focus, in stripes, at a great distance, by\nthrowing the colours of the spectrum on a screen, and by receiving\nthem into the eye directly; and I have arranged a portable apparatus\nby which any one may see the result of this or any other mixture of\nthe colours of the spectrum.  In all these cases blue and yellow do\nnot make green.  I have also made experiments on the mixture of\ncoloured powders.  Those which I used principally were \"mineral blue\"\n(from copper) and \"chrome-yellow.\"  Other blue and yellow pigments gave\ncurious results, but it was more difficult to make the mixtures, and\nthe greens were less uniform in tint.  The mixtures of these colours\nwere made by weight, and were painted on discs of paper, which were\nafterwards treated in the manner described in my paper \"On Colour as\nperceived by the Eye,\" in the _Transactions of the Royal Society of\nEdinburgh_, Vol. XXI. Part 2.  The visible effect of the colour is\nestimated in terms of the standard-coloured papers:--vermilion (V),\nultramarine (U), and emerald-green (E).  The accuracy of the results,\nand their significance, can be best understood by referring to the\npaper before mentioned.  I shall denote mineral blue by B, and\nchrome-yellow by Y; and B3 Y5 means a mixture of three parts blue and\nfive parts yellow.\n\n       Given Colour.     Standard Colours.

It\nwill be seen that the first admixture of yellow _diminishes_ the\nbrightness of the blue.  The negative values of U indicate that a\nmixture of V, U, and E cannot be made equivalent to the given colour.\nThe experiments from which these results were taken had the negative\nvalues transferred to the other side of the equation.  They were all\nmade by means of the colour-top, and were verified by repetition at\ndifferent times.  It may be necessary to remark, in conclusion, with\nreference to the mode of registering visible colours in terms of three\narbitrary standard colours, that it proceeds upon that theory of three\nprimary elements in the sensation of colour, which treats the\ninvestigation of the laws of visible colour as a branch of human\nphysiology, incapable of being deduced from the laws of light itself,\nas set forth in physical optics.  It takes advantage of the methods of\noptics to study vision itself; and its appeal is not to physical\nprinciples, but to our consciousness of our own sensations.\n\n\n\n\nOn an Instrument to illustrate Poinsot's Theory of Rotation.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n\n\n[From the _Report of the British Association_, 1856.]\n\n\nIn studying the rotation of a solid body according to Poinsot's\nmethod, we have to consider the successive positions of the\ninstantaneous axis of rotation with reference both to directions fixed\nin space and axes assumed in the moving body.  The paths traced out by\nthe pole of this axis on the _invariable plane_ and on the _central\nellipsoid_ form interesting subjects of mathematical investigation.\nBut when we attempt to follow with our eye the motion of a rotating\nbody, we find it difficult to determine through what point of the\n_body_ the instantaneous axis passes at any time,--and to determine its\npath must be still more difficult.  I have endeavoured to render\nvisible the path of the instantaneous axis, and to vary the\ncircumstances of motion, by means of a top of the same kind as that\nused by Mr Elliot, to illustrate precession*.  The body of the\ninstrument is a hollow cone of wood, rising from a ring, 7 inches in\ndiameter and 1 inch thick.  An iron axis, 8 inches long, screws into\nthe vertex of the cone.  The lower extremity has a point of hard\nsteel, which rests in an agate cup, and forms the support of the\ninstrument.  An iron nut, three ounces in weight, is made to screw on\nthe axis, and to be fixed at any point; and in the wooden ring are\nscrewed four bolts, of three ounces, working horizontally, and four\nbolts, of one ounce, working vertically.  On the upper part of the\naxis is placed a disc of card, on which are drawn four concentric\nrings.  Each ring is divided into four quadrants, which are coloured\nred, yellow, green, and blue.  The spaces between the rings are white.\nWhen the top is in motion, it is easy to see in which quadrant the\ninstantaneous axis is at any moment and the distance between it and\nthe axis of the instrument; and we observe,--1st. That the\ninstantaneous axis travels in a closed curve, and returns to its\noriginal position in the body.  2ndly. That by working the vertical\nbolts, we can make the axis of the instrument the centre of this\nclosed curve.  It will then be one of the principal axes of inertia.\n3rdly. That, by working the nut on the axis, we can make the order of\ncolours either red, yellow, green, blue, or the reverse.  When the\norder of colours is in the same direction as the rotation, it\nindicates that the axis of the instrument is that of greatest moment\nof inertia.  4thly. That if we screw the two pairs of opposite\nhorizontal bolts to different distances from the axis, the path of the\ninstantaneous pole will no longer be equidistant from the axis, but\nwill describe an ellipse, whose longer axis is in the direction of the\nmean axis of the instrument.  5thly. That if we now make one of the\ntwo horizontal axes less and the other greater than the vertical axis,\nthe instantaneous pole will separate from the axis of the instrument,\nand the axis will incline more and more till the spinning can no\nlonger go on, on account of the obliquity.  It is easy to see that, by\nattending to the laws of motion, we may produce any of the above\neffects at pleasure, and illustrate many different propositions by\nmeans of the same instrument.\n\n* _Transactions of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts_, 1855.\n\n\n\n\nAddress to the Mathematical and Physical Sections of the British\nAssociation.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n\n\n[From the _British Association Report_, Vol. XL.]\n\n[Liverpool, _September_ 15, 1870.]\n\n\nAt several of the recent Meetings of the British Association the\nvaried and important business of the Mathematical and Physical Section\nhas been introduced by an Address, the subject of which has been left\nto the selection of the President for the time being.  The perplexing\nduty of choosing a subject has not, however, fallen to me.\n\nProfessor Sylvester, the President of Section A at the Exeter Meeting,\ngave us a noble vindication of pure mathematics by laying bare, as it\nwere, the very working of the mathematical mind, and setting before\nus, not the array of symbols and brackets which form the armoury of\nthe mathematician, or the dry results which are only the monuments of\nhis conquests, but the mathematician himself, with all his human\nfaculties directed by his professional sagacity to the pursuit,\napprehension, and exhibition of that ideal harmony which he feels to\nbe the root of all knowledge, the fountain of all pleasure, and the\ncondition of all action.  The mathematician has, above all things, an\neye for symmetry; and Professor Sylvester has not only recognized the\nsymmetry formed by the combination of his own subject with those of\nthe former Presidents, but has pointed out the duties of his successor\nin the following characteristic note:--\n\n\"Mr Spottiswoode favoured the Section, in his opening Address, with a\ncombined history of the progress of Mathematics and Physics; Dr.\nTyndall's address was virtually on the limits of Physical Philosophy;\nthe one here in print,\" says Prof. Sylvester, \"is an attempted faint\nadumbration of the nature of Mathematical Science in the abstract.\nWhat is wanting (like a fourth sphere resting on three others in\ncontact) to build up the Ideal Pyramid is a discourse on the Relation\nof the two branches (Mathematics and Physics) to, their action and\nreaction upon, one another, a magnificent theme, with which it is to\nbe hoped that some future President of Section A will crown the\nedifice and make the Tetralogy (symbolizable by _A+A'_, _A_, _A'_,\n_AA'_) complete.\"\n\nThe theme thus distinctly laid down for his successor by our late\nPresident is indeed a magnificent one, far too magnificent for any\nefforts of mine to realize.  I have endeavoured to follow Mr\nSpottiswoode, as with far-reaching vision he distinguishes the systems\nof science into which phenomena, our knowledge of which is still in\nthe nebulous stage, are growing.  I have been carried by the\npenetrating insight and forcible expression of Dr Tyndall into that\nsanctuary of minuteness and of power where molecules obey the laws of\ntheir existence, clash together in fierce collision, or grapple in yet\nmore fierce embrace, building up in secret the forms of visible\nthings.  I have been guided by Prof. Sylvester towards those serene\nheights\n\n    \"Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,\n     Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,\n     Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,\n     Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar\n     Their sacred everlasting calm.\"\n\nBut who will lead me into that still more hidden and dimmer region\nwhere Thought weds Fact, where the mental operation of the\nmathematician and the physical action of the molecules are seen in\ntheir true relation?  Does not the way to it pass through the very den\nof the metaphysician, strewed with the remains of former explorers,\nand abhorred by every man of science?  It would indeed be a foolhardy\nadventure for me to take up the valuable time of the Section by\nleading you into those speculations which require, as we know,\nthousands of years even to shape themselves intelligibly.\n\nBut we are met as cultivators of mathematics and physics.  In our\ndaily work we are led up to questions the same in kind with those of\nmetaphysics; and we approach them, not trusting to the native\npenetrating power of our own minds, but trained by a long-continued\nadjustment of our modes of thought to the facts of external nature.\n\nAs mathematicians, we perform certain mental operations on the symbols\nof number or of quantity, and, by proceeding step by step from more\nsimple to more complex operations, we are enabled to express the same\nthing in many different forms.  The equivalence of these different\nforms, though a necessary consequence of self-evident axioms, is not\nalways, to our minds, self-evident; but the mathematician, who by long\npractice has acquired a familiarity with many of these forms, and has\nbecome expert in the processes which lead from one to another, can\noften transform a perplexing expression into another which explains\nits meaning in more intelligible language.\n\nAs students of Physics we observe phenomena under varied\ncircumstances, and endeavour to deduce the laws of their relations.\nEvery natural phenomenon is, to our minds, the result of an infinitely\ncomplex system of conditions.  What we set ourselves to do is to\nunravel these conditions, and by viewing the phenomenon in a way which\nis in itself partial and imperfect, to piece out its features one by\none, beginning with that which strikes us first, and thus gradually\nlearning how to look at the whole phenomenon so as to obtain a\ncontinually greater degree of clearness and distinctness.  In this\nprocess, the feature which presents itself most forcibly to the\nuntrained inquirer may not be that which is considered most\nfundamental by the experienced man of science; for the success of any\nphysical investigation depends on the judicious selection of what is\nto be observed as of primary importance, combined with a voluntary\nabstraction of the mind from those features which, however attractive\nthey appear, we are not yet sufficiently advanced in science to\ninvestigate with profit.\n\nIntellectual processes of this kind have been going on since the first\nformation of language, and are going on still.  No doubt the feature\nwhich strikes us first and most forcibly in any phenomenon, is the\npleasure or the pain which accompanies it, and the agreeable or\ndisagreeable results which follow after it.  A theory of nature from\nthis point of view is embodied in many of our words and phrases, and\nis by no means extinct even in our deliberate opinions.\n\nIt was a great step in science when men became convinced that, in\norder to understand the nature of things, they must begin by asking,\nnot whether a thing is good or bad, noxious or beneficial, but of what\nkind is it? and how much is there of it?  Quality and Quantity were\nthen first recognized as the primary features to be observed in\nscientific inquiry.\n\nAs science has been developed, the domain of quantity has everywhere\nencroached on that of quality, till the process of scientific inquiry\nseems to have become simply the measurement and registration of\nquantities, combined with a mathematical discussion of the numbers\nthus obtained.  It is this scientific method of directing our\nattention to those features of phenomena which may be regarded as\nquantities which brings physical research under the influence of\nmathematical reasoning.  In the work of the Section we shall have\nabundant examples of the successful application of this method to the\nmost recent conquests of science; but I wish at present to direct your\nattention to some of the reciprocal effects of the progress of science\non those elementary conceptions which are sometimes thought to be\nbeyond the reach of change.\n\nIf the skill of the mathematician has enabled the experimentalist to\nsee that the quantities which he has measured are connected by\nnecessary relations, the discoveries of physics have revealed to the\nmathematician new forms of quantities which he could never have\nimagined for himself.\n\nOf the methods by which the mathematician may make his labours most\nuseful to the student of nature, that which I think is at present most\nimportant is the systematic classification of quantities.\n\nThe quantities which we study in mathematics and physics may be\nclassified in two different ways.\n\nThe student who wishes to master any particular science must make\nhimself familiar with the various kinds of quantities which belong to\nthat science.  When he understands all the relations between these\nquantities, he regards them as forming a connected system, and he\nclasses the whole system of quantities together as belonging to that\nparticular science.  This classification is the most natural from a\nphysical point of view, and it is generally the first in order of\ntime.\n\nBut when the student has become acquainted with several different\nsciences, he finds that the mathematical processes and trains of\nreasoning in one science resemble those in another so much that his\nknowledge of the one science may be made a most useful help in the\nstudy of the other.\n\nWhen he examines into the reason of this, he finds that in the two\nsciences he has been dealing with systems of quantities, in which the\nmathematical forms of the relations of the quantities are the same in\nboth systems, though the physical nature of the quantities may be\nutterly different.\n\nHe is thus led to recognize a classification of quantities on a new\nprinciple, according to which the physical nature of the quantity is\nsubordinated to its mathematical form.  This is the point of view\nwhich is characteristic of the mathematician; but it stands second to\nthe physical aspect in order of time, because the human mind, in order\nto conceive of different kinds of quantities, must have them presented\nto it by nature.\n\nI do not here refer to the fact that all quantities, as such, are\nsubject to the rules of arithmetic and algebra, and are therefore\ncapable of being submitted to those dry calculations which represent,\nto so many minds, their only idea of mathematics.\n\nThe human mind is seldom satisfied, and is certainly never exercising\nits highest functions, when it is doing the work of a calculating\nmachine.  What the man of science, whether he is a mathematician or a\nphysical inquirer, aims at is, to acquire and develope clear ideas of\nthe things he deals with.  For this purpose he is willing to enter on\nlong calculations, and to be for a season a calculating machine, if he\ncan only at last make his ideas clearer.\n\nBut if he finds that clear ideas are not to be obtained by means of\nprocesses the steps of which he is sure to forget before he has\nreached the conclusion, it is much better that he should turn to\nanother method, and try to understand the subject by means of\nwell-chosen illustrations derived from subjects with which he is more\nfamiliar.\n\nWe all know how much more popular the illustrative method of\nexposition is found, than that in which bare processes of reasoning\nand calculation form the principal subject of discourse.\n\nNow a truly scientific illustration is a method to enable the mind to\ngrasp some conception or law in one branch of science, by placing\nbefore it a conception or a law in a different branch of science, and\ndirecting the mind to lay hold of that mathematical form which is\ncommon to the corresponding ideas in the two sciences, leaving out of\naccount for the present the difference between the physical nature of\nthe real phenomena.\n\nThe correctness of such an illustration depends on whether the two\nsystems of ideas which are compared together are really analogous in\nform, or whether, in other words, the corresponding physical\nquantities really belong to the same mathematical class.  When this\ncondition is fulfilled, the illustration is not only convenient for\nteaching science in a pleasant and easy manner, but the recognition of\nthe formal analogy between the two systems of ideas leads to a\nknowledge of both, more profound than could be obtained by studying\neach system separately.\n\nThere are men who, when any relation or law, however complex, is put\nbefore them in a symbolical form, can grasp its full meaning as a\nrelation among abstract quantities.  Such men sometimes treat with\nindifference the further statement that quantities actually exist in\nnature which fulfil this relation.  The mental image of the concrete\nreality seems rather to disturb than to assist their contemplations.\nBut the great majority of mankind are utterly unable, without long\ntraining, to retain in their minds the unembodied symbols of the pure\nmathematician, so that, if science is ever to become popular, and yet\nremain scientific, it must be by a profound study and a copious\napplication of those principles of the mathematical classification of\nquantities which, as we have seen, lie at the root of every truly\nscientific illustration.\n\nThere are, as I have said, some minds which can go on contemplating\nwith satisfaction pure quantities presented to the eye by symbols, and\nto the mind in a form which none but mathematicians can conceive.\n\nThere are others who feel more enjoyment in following geometrical\nforms, which they draw on paper, or build up in the empty space before\nthem.\n\nOthers, again, are not content unless they can project their whole\nphysical energies into the scene which they conjure up.  They learn at\nwhat a rate the planets rush through space, and they experience a\ndelightful feeling of exhilaration.  They calculate the forces with\nwhich the heavenly bodies pull at one another, and they feel their own\nmuscles straining with the effort.\n\nTo such men momentum, energy, mass are not mere abstract expressions\nof the results of scientific inquiry.  They are words of power, which\nstir their souls like the memories of childhood.\n\nFor the sake of persons of these different types, scientific truth\nshould be presented in different forms, and should be regarded as\nequally scientific whether it appears in the robust form and the vivid\ncolouring of a physical illustration, or in the tenuity and paleness\nof a symbolical expression.\n\nTime would fail me if I were to attempt to illustrate by examples the\nscientific value of the classification of quantities.  I shall only\nmention the name of that important class of magnitudes having\ndirection in space which Hamilton has called vectors, and which form\nthe subject-matter of the Calculus of Quaternions, a branch of\nmathematics which, when it shall have been thoroughly understood by\nmen of the illustrative type, and clothed by them with physical\nimagery, will become, perhaps under some new name, a most powerful\nmethod of communicating truly scientific knowledge to persons\napparently devoid of the calculating spirit.\n\nThe mutual action and reaction between the different departments of\nhuman thought is so interesting to the student of scientific progress,\nthat, at the risk of still further encroaching on the valuable time of\nthe Section, I shall say a few words on a branch of physics which not\nvery long ago would have been considered rather a branch of\nmetaphysics.  I mean the atomic theory, or, as it is now called, the\nmolecular theory of the constitution of bodies.\n\nNot many years ago if we had been asked in what regions of physical\nscience the advance of discovery was least apparent, we should have\npointed to the hopelessly distant fixed stars on the one hand, and to\nthe inscrutable delicacy of the texture of material bodies on the\nother.\n\nIndeed, if we are to regard Comte as in any degree representing the\nscientific opinion of his time, the research into what takes place\nbeyond our own solar system seemed then to be exceedingly unpromising,\nif not altogether illusory.\n\nThe opinion that the bodies which we see and handle, which we can set\nin motion or leave at rest, which we can break in pieces and destroy,\nare composed of smaller bodies which we cannot see or handle, which\nare always in motion, and which can neither be stopped nor broken in\npieces, nor in any way destroyed or deprived of the least of their\nproperties, was known by the name of the Atomic theory.  It was\nassociated with the names of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, and\nwas commonly supposed to admit the existence only of atoms and void,\nto the exclusion of any other basis of things from the universe.\n\nIn many physical reasonings and mathematical calculations we are\naccustomed to argue as if such substances as air, water, or metal,\nwhich appear to our senses uniform and continuous, were strictly and\nmathematically uniform and continuous.\n\nWe know that we can divide a pint of water into many millions of\nportions, each of which is as fully endowed with all the properties of\nwater as the whole pint was; and it seems only natural to conclude\nthat we might go on subdividing the water for ever, just as we can\nnever come to a limit in subdividing the space in which it is\ncontained.  We have heard how Faraday divided a grain of gold into an\ninconceivable number of separate particles, and we may see Dr Tyndall\nproduce from a mere suspicion of nitrite of butyle an immense cloud,\nthe minute visible portion of which is still cloud, and therefore must\ncontain many molecules of nitrite of butyle.\n\nBut evidence from different and independent sources is now crowding in\nupon us which compels us to admit that if we could push the process of\nsubdivision still further we should come to a limit, because each\nportion would then contain only one molecule, an individual body, one\nand indivisible, unalterable by any power in nature.\n\nEven in our ordinary experiments on very finely divided matter we find\nthat the substance is beginning to lose the properties which it\nexhibits when in a large mass, and that effects depending on the\nindividual action of molecules are beginning to become prominent.\n\nThe study of these phenomena is at present the path which leads to the\ndevelopment of molecular science.\n\nThat superficial tension of liquids which is called capillary\nattraction is one of these phenomena.  Another important class of\nphenomena are those which are due to that motion of agitation by which\nthe molecules of a liquid or gas are continually working their way\nfrom one place to another, and continually changing their course, like\npeople hustled in a crowd.\n\nOn this depends the rate of diffusion of gases and liquids through\neach other, to the study of which, as one of the keys of molecular\nscience, that unwearied inquirer into nature's secrets, the late Prof.\nGraham, devoted such arduous labour.\n\nThe rate of electrolytic conduction is, according to Wiedemann's\ntheory, influenced by the same cause; and the conduction of heat in\nfluids depends probably on the same kind of action.  In the case of\ngases, a molecular theory has been developed by Clausius and others,\ncapable of mathematical treatment, and subjected to experimental\ninvestigation; and by this theory nearly every known mechanical\nproperty of gases has been explained on dynamical principles; so that\nthe properties of individual gaseous molecules are in a fair way to\nbecome objects of scientific research.\n\nNow Mr Stoney has pointed out[1] that the numerical results of\nexperiments on gases render it probable that the mean distance of\ntheir particles at the ordinary temperature and pressure is a quantity\nof the same order of magnitude as a millionth of a millimetre, and Sir\nWilliam Thomson has since[2] shewn, by several independent lines of\nargument, drawn from phenomena so different in themselves as the\nelectrification of metals by contact, the tension of soap-bubbles, and\nthe friction of air, that in ordinary solids and liquids the average\ndistance between contiguous molecules is less than the\nhundred-millionth, and greater than the two-thousand-millionth of a\ncentimetre.\n\n[1] _Phil. Mag._, Aug. 1868.\n[2] _Nature_, March 31, 1870.\n\nThese, of course, are exceedingly rough estimates, for they are\nderived from measurements some of which are still confessedly very\nrough; but if at the present time, we can form even a rough plan for\narriving at results of this kind, we may hope that, as our means of\nexperimental inquiry become more accurate and more varied, our\nconception of a molecule will become more definite, so that we may be\nable at no distant period to estimate its weight with a greater degree\nof precision.\n\nA theory, which Sir W. Thomson has founded on Helmholtz's splendid\nhydrodynamical theorems, seeks for the properties of molecules in the\nring vortices of a uniform, frictionless, incompressible fluid.  Such\nwhirling rings may be seen when an experienced smoker sends out a\ndexterous puff of smoke into the still air, but a more evanescent\nphenomenon it is difficult to conceive.  This evanescence is owing to\nthe viscosity of the air; but Helmholtz has shewn that in a perfect\nfluid such a whirling ring, if once generated, would go on whirling\nfor ever, would always consist of the very same portion of the fluid\nwhich was first set whirling, and could never be cut in two by any\nnatural cause.  The generation of a ring-vortex is of course equally\nbeyond the power of natural causes, but once generated, it has the\nproperties of individuality, permanence in quantity, and\nindestructibility.  It is also the recipient of impulse and of energy,\nwhich is all we can affirm of matter; and these ring-vortices are\ncapable of such varied connexions and knotted self-involutions, that\nthe properties of differently knotted vortices must be as different as\nthose of different kinds of molecules can be.\n\nIf a theory of this kind should be found, after conquering the\nenormous mathematical difficulties of the subject, to represent in any\ndegree the actual properties of molecules, it will stand in a very\ndifferent scientific position from those theories of molecular action\nwhich are formed by investing the molecule with an arbitrary system of\ncentral forces invented expressly to account for the observed\nphenomena.\n\nIn the vortex theory we have nothing arbitrary, no central forces or\noccult properties of any other kind.  We have nothing but matter and\nmotion, and when the vortex is once started its properties are all\ndetermined from the original impetus, and no further assumptions are\npossible.\n\nEven in the present undeveloped state of the theory, the contemplation\nof the individuality and indestructibility of a ring-vortex in a\nperfect fluid cannot fail to disturb the commonly received opinion\nthat a molecule, in order to be permanent, must be a very hard body.\n\nIn fact one of the first conditions which a molecule must fulfil is,\napparently, inconsistent with its being a single hard body.  We know\nfrom those spectroscopic researches which have thrown so much light on\ndifferent branches of science, that a molecule can be set into a state\nof internal vibration, in which it gives off to the surrounding medium\nlight of definite refrangibility--light, that is, of definite\nwave-length and definite period of vibration.  The fact that all the\nmolecules (say, of hydrogen) which we can procure for our experiments,\nwhen agitated by heat or by the passage of an electric spark, vibrate\nprecisely in the same periodic time, or, to speak more accurately,\nthat their vibrations are composed of a system of simple vibrations\nhaving always the same periods, is a very remarkable fact.\n\nI must leave it to others to describe the progress of that splendid\nseries of spectroscopic discoveries by which the chemistry of the\nheavenly bodies has been brought within the range of human inquiry.  I\nwish rather to direct your attention to the fact that, not only has\nevery molecule of terrestrial hydrogen the same system of periods of\nfree vibration, but that the spectroscopic examination of the light of\nthe sun and stars shews that, in regions the distance of which we can\nonly feebly imagine, there are molecules vibrating in as exact unison\nwith the molecules of terrestrial hydrogen as two tuning-forks tuned\nto concert pitch, or two watches regulated to solar time.\n\nNow this absolute equality in the magnitude of quantities, occurring\nin all parts of the universe, is worth our consideration.\n\nThe dimensions of individual natural bodies are either quite\nindeterminate, as in the case of planets, stones, trees, &c., or they\nvary within moderate limits, as in the case of seeds, eggs, &c.; but\neven in these cases small quantitative differences are met with which\ndo not interfere with the essential properties of the body.\n\nEven crystals, which are so definite in geometrical form, are variable\nwith respect to their absolute dimensions.\n\nAmong the works of man we sometimes find a certain degree of\nuniformity.\n\nThere is a uniformity among the different bullets which are cast in\nthe same mould, and the different copies of a book printed from the\nsame type.\n\nIf we examine the coins, or the weights and measures, of a civilized\ncountry, we find a uniformity, which is produced by careful adjustment\nto standards made and provided by the state.  The degree of uniformity\nof these national standards is a measure of that spirit of justice in\nthe nation which has enacted laws to regulate them and appointed\nofficers to test them.\n\nThis subject is one in which we, as a scientific body, take a warm\ninterest; and you are all aware of the vast amount of scientific work\nwhich has been expended, and profitably expended, in providing weights\nand measures for commercial and scientific purposes.\n\nThe earth has been measured as a basis for a permanent standard of\nlength, and every property of metals has been investigated to guard\nagainst any alteration of the material standards when made.  To weigh\nor measure any thing with modern accuracy, requires a course of\nexperiment and calculation in which almost every branch of physics and\nmathematics is brought into requisition.\n\nYet, after all, the dimensions of our earth and its time of rotation,\nthough, relatively to our present means of comparison, very permanent,\nare not so by any physical necessity.  The earth might contract by\ncooling, or it might be enlarged by a layer of meteorites falling on\nit, or its rate of revolution might slowly slacken, and yet it would\ncontinue to be as much a planet as before.\n\nBut a molecule, say of hydrogen, if either its mass or its time of\nvibration were to be altered in the least, would no longer be a\nmolecule of hydrogen.\n\nIf, then, we wish to obtain standards of length, time, and mass which\nshall be absolutely permanent, we must seek them not in the\ndimensions, or the motion, or the mass of our planet, but in the\nwave-length, the period of vibration, and the absolute mass of these\nimperishable and unalterable and perfectly similar molecules.\n\nWhen we find that here, and in the starry heavens, there are\ninnumerable multitudes of little bodies of exactly the same mass, so\nmany, and no more, to the grain, and vibrating in exactly the same\ntime, so many times, and no more, in a second, and when we reflect\nthat no power in nature can now alter in the least either the mass or\nthe period of any one of them, we seem to have advanced along the path\nof natural knowledge to one of those points at which we must accept\nthe guidance of that faith by which we understand that \"that which is\nseen was not made of things which do appear.\"\n\nOne of the most remarkable results of the progress of molecular\nscience is the light it has thrown on the nature of irreversible\nprocesses--processes, that is, which always tend towards and never\naway from a certain limiting state.  Thus, if two gases be put into\nthe same vessel, they become mixed, and the mixture tends continually\nto become more uniform.  If two unequally heated portions of the same\ngas are put into the vessel, something of the kind takes place, and\nthe whole tends to become of the same temperature.  If two unequally\nheated solid bodies be placed in contact, a continual approximation of\nboth to an intermediate temperature takes place.\n\nIn the case of the two gases, a separation may be effected by chemical\nmeans; but in the other two cases the former state of things cannot be\nrestored by any natural process.\n\nIn the case of the conduction or diffusion of heat the process is not\nonly irreversible, but it involves the irreversible diminution of that\npart of the whole stock of thermal energy which is capable of being\nconverted into mechanical work.\n\nThis is Thomson's theory of the irreversible dissipation of energy,\nand it is equivalent to the doctrine of Clausius concerning the growth\nof what he calls Entropy.\n\nThe irreversible character of this process is strikingly embodied in\nFourier's theory of the conduction of heat, where the formulae\nthemselves indicate, for all positive values of the time, a possible\nsolution which continually tends to the form of a uniform diffusion of\nheat.\n\nBut if we attempt to ascend the stream of time by giving to its symbol\ncontinually diminishing values, we are led up to a state of things in\nwhich the formula has what is called a critical value; and if we\ninquire into the state of things the instant before, we find that the\nformula becomes absurd.\n\nWe thus arrive at the conception of a state of things which cannot be\nconceived as the physical result of a previous state of things, and we\nfind that this critical condition actually existed at an epoch not in\nthe utmost depths of a past eternity, but separated from the present\ntime by a finite interval.\n\nThis idea of a beginning is one which the physical researches of\nrecent times have brought home to us, more than any observer of the\ncourse of scientific thought in former times would have had reason to\nexpect.\n\nBut the mind of man is not, like Fourier's heated body, continually\nsettling down into an ultimate state of quiet uniformity, the\ncharacter of which we can already predict; it is rather like a tree,\nshooting out branches which adapt themselves to the new aspects of the\nsky towards which they climb, and roots which contort themselves among\nthe strange strata of the earth into which they delve.  To us who\nbreathe only the spirit of our own age, and know only the\ncharacteristics of contemporary thought, it is as impossible to\npredict the general tone of the science of the future as it is to\nanticipate the particular discoveries which it will make.\n\nPhysical research is continually revealing to us new features of\nnatural processes, and we are thus compelled to search for new forms\nof thought appropriate to these features.  Hence the importance of a\ncareful study of those relations between mathematics and Physics which\ndetermine the conditions under which the ideas derived from one\ndepartment of physics may be safely used in forming ideas to be\nemployed in a new department.\n\nThe figure of speech or of thought by which we transfer the language\nand ideas of a familiar science to one with which we are less\nacquainted may be called Scientific Metaphor.\n\nThus the words Velocity, Momentum, Force, &c. have acquired certain\nprecise meanings in Elementary Dynamics.  They are also employed in\nthe Dynamics of a Connected System in a sense which, though perfectly\nanalogous to the elementary sense, is wider and more general.\n\nThese generalized forms of elementary ideas may be called metaphorical\nterms in the sense in which every abstract term is metaphorical.  The\ncharacteristic of a truly scientific system of metaphors is that each\nterm in its metaphorical use retains all the formal relations to the\nother terms of the system which it had in its original use.  The\nmethod is then truly scientific--that is, not only a legitimate\nproduct of science, but capable of generating science in its turn.\n\nThere are certain electrical phenomena, again, which are connected\ntogether by relations of the same form as those which connect\ndynamical phenomena.  To apply to these the phrases of dynamics with\nproper distinctions and provisional reservations is an example of a\nmetaphor of a bolder kind; but it is a legitimate metaphor if it\nconveys a true idea of the electrical relations to those who have been\nalready trained in dynamics.\n\nSuppose, then, that we have successfully introduced certain ideas\nbelonging to an elementary science by applying them metaphorically to\nsome new class of phenomena.  It becomes an important philosophical\nquestion to determine in what degree the applicability of the old\nideas to the new subject may be taken as evidence that the new\nphenomena are physically similar to the old.\n\nThe best instances for the determination of this question are those in\nwhich two different explanations have been given of the same thing.\n\nThe most celebrated case of this kind is that of the corpuscular and\nthe undulatory theories of light.  Up to a certain point the phenomena\nof light are equally well explained by both; beyond this point, one of\nthem fails.\n\nTo understand the true relation of these theories in that part of the\nfield where they seem equally applicable we must look at them in the\nlight which Hamilton has thrown upon them by his discovery that to\nevery brachistochrone problem there corresponds a problem of free\nmotion, involving different velocities and times, but resulting in the\nsame geometrical path.  Professor Tait has written a very interesting\npaper on this subject.\n\nAccording to a theory of electricity which is making great progress in\nGermany, two electrical particles act on one another directly at a\ndistance, but with a force which, according to Weber, depends on their\nrelative velocity, and according to a theory hinted at by Gauss, and\ndeveloped by Riemann, Lorenz, and Neumann, acts not instantaneously,\nbut after a time depending on the distance.  The power with which this\ntheory, in the hands of these eminent men, explains every kind of\nelectrical phenomena must be studied in order to be appreciated.\n\nAnother theory of electricity, which I prefer, denies action at a\ndistance and attributes electric action to tensions and pressures in\nan all-pervading medium, these stresses being the same in kind with\nthose familiar to engineers, and the medium being identical with that\nin which light is supposed to be propagated.\n\nBoth these theories are found to explain not only the phenomena by the\naid of which they were originally constructed, but other phenomena,\nwhich were not thought of or perhaps not known at the time; and both\nhave independently arrived at the same numerical result, which gives\nthe absolute velocity of light in terms of electrical quantities.\n\nThat theories apparently so fundamentally opposed should have so large\na field of truth common to both is a fact the philosophical importance\nof which we cannot fully appreciate till we have reached a scientific\naltitude from which the true relation between hypotheses so different\ncan be seen.\n\nI shall only make one more remark on the relation between Mathematics\nand Physics.  In themselves, one is an operation of the mind, the\nother is a dance of molecules.  The molecules have laws of their own,\nsome of which we select as most intelligible to us and most amenable\nto our calculation.  We form a theory from these partial data, and we\nascribe any deviation of the actual phenomena from this theory to\ndisturbing causes.  At the same time we confess that what we call\ndisturbing causes are simply those parts of the true circumstances\nwhich we do not know or have neglected, and we endeavour in future to\ntake account of them.  We thus acknowledge that the so-called\ndisturbance is a mere figment of the mind, not a fact of nature, and\nthat in natural action there is no disturbance.\n\nBut this is not the only way in which the harmony of the material with\nthe mental operation may be disturbed.  The mind of the mathematician\nis subject to many disturbing causes, such as fatigue, loss of memory,\nand hasty conclusions; and it is found that, from these and other\ncauses, mathematicians make mistakes.\n\nI am not prepared to deny that, to some mind of a higher order than\nours, each of these errors might be traced to the regular operation of\nthe laws of actual thinking; in fact we ourselves often do detect, not\nonly errors of calculation, but the causes of these errors.  This,\nhowever, by no means alters our conviction that they are errors, and\nthat one process of thought is right and another process wrong.  I\n\nOne of the most profound mathematicians and thinkers of our time, the\nlate George Boole, when reflecting on the precise and almost\nmathematical character of the laws of right thinking as compared with\nthe exceedingly perplexing though perhaps equally determinate laws of\nactual and fallible thinking, was led to another of those points of\nview from which Science seems to look out into a region beyond her own\ndomain.\n\n\"We must admit,\" he says, \"that there exist laws\" (of thought) \"which\neven the rigour of their mathematical forms does not preserve from\nviolation.  We must ascribe to them an authority, the essence of which\ndoes not consist in power, a supremacy which the analogy of the\ninviolable order of the natural world in no way assists us to\ncomprehend.\"\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory Lecture on Experimental Physics.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge, in accordance with that law of its\nevolution, by which, while maintaining the strictest continuity\nbetween the successive phases of its history, it adapts itself with\nmore or less promptness to the requirements of the times, has lately\ninstituted a course of Experimental Physics.  This course of study,\nwhile it requires us to maintain in action all those powers of\nattention and analysis which have been so long cultivated in the\nUniversity, calls on us to exercise our senses in observation, and our\nhands in manipulation.  The familiar apparatus of pen, ink, and paper\nwill no longer be sufficient for us, and we shall require more room\nthan that afforded by a seat at a desk, and a wider area than that of\nthe black board.  We owe it to the munificence of our Chancellor,\nthat, whatever be the character in other respects of the experiments\nwhich we hope hereafter to conduct, the material facilities for their\nfull development will be upon a scale which has not hitherto been\nsurpassed.\n\nThe main feature, therefore, of Experimental Physics at Cambridge is\nthe Devonshire Physical Laboratory, and I think it desirable that on\nthe present occasion, before we enter on the details of any special\nstudy, we should consider by what means we, the University of\nCambridge, may, as a living body, appropriate and vitalise this new\norgan, the outward shell of which we expect soon to rise before us.\nThe course of study at this University has always included Natural\nPhilosophy, as well as Pure Mathematics.  To diffuse a sound knowledge\nof Physics, and to imbue the minds of our students with correct\ndynamical principles, have been long regarded as among our highest\nfunctions, and very few of us can now place ourselves in the mental\ncondition in which even such philosophers as the great Descartes were\ninvolved in the days before Newton had announced the true laws of the\nmotion of bodies.  Indeed the cultivation and diffusion of sound\ndynamical ideas has already effected a great change in the language\nand thoughts even of those who make no pretensions to science, and we\nare daily receiving fresh proofs that the popularisation of scientific\ndoctrines is producing as great an alteration in the mental state of\nsociety as the material applications of science are effecting in its\noutward life.  Such indeed is the respect paid to science, that the\nmost absurd opinions may become current, provided they are expressed\nin language, the sound of which recals some well-known scientific\nphrase.  If society is thus prepared to receive all kinds of\nscientific doctrines, it is our part to provide for the diffusion and\ncultivation, not only of true scientific principles, but of a spirit\nof sound criticism, founded on an examination of the evidences on\nwhich statements apparently scientific depend.\n\nWhen we shall be able to employ in scientific education, not only the\ntrained attention of the student, and his familiarity with symbols,\nbut the keenness of his eye, the quickness of his ear, the delicacy of\nhis touch, and the adroitness of his fingers, we shall not only extend\nour influence over a class of men who are not fond of cold\nabstractions, but, by opening at once all the gateways of knowledge,\nwe shall ensure the association of the doctrines of science with those\nelementary sensations which form the obscure background of all our\nconscious thoughts, and which lend a vividness and relief to ideas,\nwhich, when presented as mere abstract terms, are apt to fade entirely\nfrom the memory.\n\nIn a course of Experimental Physics we may consider either the Physics\nor the Experiments as the leading feature.  We may either employ the\nexperiments to illustrate the phenomena of a particular branch of\nPhysics, or we may make some physical research in order to exemplify a\nparticular experimental method.  In the order of time, we should\nbegin, in the Lecture Room, with a course of lectures on some branch\nof Physics aided by experiments of illustration, and conclude, in the\nLaboratory, with a course of experiments of research.\n\nLet me say a few words on these two classes of\nexperiments,--Experiments of Illustration and Experiments of Research.\nThe aim of an experiment of illustration is to throw light upon some\nscientific idea so that the student may be enabled to grasp it.  The\ncircumstances of the experiment are so arranged that the phenomenon\nwhich we wish to observe or to exhibit is brought into prominence,\ninstead of being obscured and entangled among other phenomena, as it\nis when it occurs in the ordinary course of nature.  To exhibit\nillustrative experiments, to encourage others to make them, and to\ncultivate in every way the ideas on which they throw light, forms an\nimportant part of our duty.  The simpler the materials of an\nillustrative experiment, and the more familiar they are to the\nstudent, the more thoroughly is he likely to acquire the idea which it\nis meant to illustrate.  The educational value of such experiments is\noften inversely proportional to the complexity of the apparatus.  The\nstudent who uses home-made apparatus, which is always going wrong,\noften learns more than one who has the use of carefully adjusted\ninstruments, to which he is apt to trust, and which he dares not take\nto pieces.\n\nIt is very necessary that those who are trying to learn from books the\nfacts of physical science should be enabled by the help of a few\nillustrative experiments to recognise these facts when they meet with\nthem out of doors.  Science appears to us with a very different aspect\nafter we have found out that it is not in lecture rooms only, and by\nmeans of the electric light projected on a screen, that we may witness\nphysical phenomena, but that we may find illustrations of the highest\ndoctrines of science in games and gymnastics, in travelling by land\nand by water, in storms of the air and of the sea, and wherever there\nis matter in motion.\n\nThis habit of recognising principles amid the endless variety of their\naction can never degrade our sense of the sublimity of nature, or mar\nour enjoyment of its beauty.  On the contrary, it tends to rescue our\nscientific ideas from that vague condition in which we too often leave\nthem, buried among the other products of a lazy credulity, and to\nraise them into their proper position among the doctrines in which our\nfaith is so assured, that we are ready at all times to act on them.\n\nExperiments of illustration may be of very different kinds.  Some may\nbe adaptations of the commonest operations of ordinary life, others\nmay be carefully arranged exhibitions of some phenomenon which occurs\nonly under peculiar conditions.  They all, however, agree in this,\nthat their aim is to present some phenomenon to the senses of the\nstudent in such a way that he may associate with it the appropriate\nscientific idea.  When he has grasped this idea, the experiment which\nillustrates it has served its purpose.\n\nIn an experiment of research, on the other hand, this is not the\nprincipal aim.  It is true that an experiment, in which the principal\naim is to see what happens under certain conditions, may be regarded\nas an experiment of research by those who are not yet familiar with\nthe result, but in experimental researches, strictly so called, the\nultimate object is to measure something which we have already seen--to\nobtain a numerical estimate of some magnitude.\n\nExperiments of this class--those in which measurement of some kind is\ninvolved, are the proper work of a Physical Laboratory.  In every\nexperiment we have first to make our senses familiar with the\nphenomenon, but we must not stop here, we must find out which of its\nfeatures are capable of measurement, and what measurements are\nrequired in order to make a complete specification of the phenomenon.\nWe must then make these measurements, and deduce from them the result\nwhich we require to find.\n\nThis characteristic of modern experiments--that they consist\nprincipally of measurements,--is so prominent, that the opinion seems\nto have got abroad, that in a few years all the great physical\nconstants will have been approximately estimated, and that the only\noccupation which will then be left to men of science will be to carry\non these measurements to another place of decimals.\n\nIf this is really the state of things to which we are approaching, our\nLaboratory may perhaps become celebrated as a place of conscientious\nlabour and consummate skill, but it will be out of place in the\nUniversity, and ought rather to be classed with the other great\nworkshops of our country, where equal ability is directed to more\nuseful ends.\n\nBut we have no right to think thus of the unsearchable riches of\ncreation, or of the untried fertility of those fresh minds into which\nthese riches will continue to be poured.  It may possibly be true\nthat, in some of those fields of discovery which lie open to such\nrough observations as can be made without artificial methods, the\ngreat explorers of former times have appropriated most of what is\nvaluable, and that the gleanings which remain are sought after, rather\nfor their abstruseness, than for their intrinsic worth.  But the\nhistory of science shews that even during that phase of her progress\nin which she devotes herself to improving the accuracy of the\nnumerical measurement of quantities with which she has long been\nfamiliar, she is preparing the materials for the subjugation of new\nregions, which would have remained unknown if she had been contented\nwith the rough methods of her early pioneers.  I might bring forward\ninstances gathered from every branch of science, shewing how the\nlabour of careful measurement has been rewarded by the discovery of\nnew fields of research, and by the development of new scientific\nideas.  But the history of the science of terrestrial magnetism\naffords us a sufficient example of what may be done by Experiments in\nConcert, such as we hope some day to perform in our Laboratory.\n\nThat celebrated traveller, Humboldt, was profoundly impressed with the\nscientific value of a combined effort to be made by the observers of\nall nations, to obtain accurate measurements of the magnetism of the\nearth; and we owe it mainly to his enthusiasm for science, his great\nreputation and his wide-spread influence, that not only private men of\nscience, but the governments of most of the civilised nations, our own\namong the number, were induced to take part in the enterprise.  But\nthe actual working out of the scheme, and the arrangements by which\nthe labours of the observers were so directed as to obtain the best\nresults, we owe to the great mathematician Gauss, working along with\nWeber, the future founder of the science of electro-magnetic\nmeasurement, in the magnetic observatory of Gottingen, and aided by\nthe skill of the instrument-maker Leyser.  These men, however, did not\nwork alone.  Numbers of scientific men joined the Magnetic Union,\nlearned the use of the new instruments and the new methods of reducing\nthe observations; and in every city of Europe you might see them, at\ncertain stated times, sitting, each in his cold wooden shed, with his\neye fixed at the telescope, his ear attentive to the clock, and his\npencil recording in his note-book the instantaneous position of the\nsuspended magnet.\n\nBacon's conception of \"Experiments in concert\" was thus realised, the\nscattered forces of science were converted into a regular army, and\nemulation and jealousy became out of place, for the results obtained\nby any one observer were of no value till they were combined with\nthose of the others.\n\nThe increase in the accuracy and completeness of magnetic observations\nwhich was obtained by the new method, opened up fields of research\nwhich were hardly suspected to exist by those whose observations of\nthe magnetic needle had been conducted in a more primitive manner.  We\nmust reserve for its proper place in our course any detailed\ndescription of the disturbances to which the magnetism of our planet\nis found to be subject.  Some of these disturbances are periodic,\nfollowing the regular courses of the sun and moon.  Others are sudden,\nand are called magnetic storms, but, like the storms of the\natmosphere, they have their known seasons of frequency.  The last and\nthe most mysterious of these magnetic changes is that secular\nvariation by which the whole character of the earth, as a great\nmagnet, is being slowly modified, while the magnetic poles creep on,\nfrom century to century, along their winding track in the polar\nregions.\n\nWe have thus learned that the interior of the earth is subject to the\ninfluences of the heavenly bodies, but that besides this there is a\nconstantly progressive change going on, the cause of which is entirely\nunknown.  In each of the magnetic observatories throughout the world\nan arrangement is at work, by means of which a suspended magnet\ndirects a ray of light on a preparred sheet of paper moved by\nclockwork.  On that paper the never-resting heart of the earth is now\ntracing, in telegraphic symbols which will one day be interpreted, a\nrecord of its pulsations and its flutterings, as well as of that slow\nbut mighty working which warns us that we must not suppose that the\ninner history of our planet is ended.\n\nBut this great experimental research on Terrestrial Magnetism produced\nlasting effects on the progress of science in general.  I need only\nmention one or two instances.  The new methods of measuring forces\nwere successfully applied by Weber to the numerical determination of\nall the phenomena of electricity, and very soon afterwards the\nelectric telegraph, by conferring a commercial value on exact\nnumerical measurements, contributed largely to the advancement, as\nwell as to the diffusion of scientific knowledge.\n\nBut it is not in these more modern branches of science alone that this\ninfluence is felt.  It is to Gauss, to the Magnetic Union, and to\nmagnetic observers in general, that we owe our deliverance from that\nabsurd method of estimating forces by a variable standard which\nprevailed so long even among men of science.  It was Gauss who first\nbased the practical measurement of magnetic force (and therefore of\nevery other force) on those long established principles, which, though\nthey are embodied in every dynamical equation, have been so generally\nset aside, that these very equations, though correctly given in our\nCambridge textbooks, are usually explained there by assuming, in\naddition to the variable standard of force, a variable, and therefore\nillegal, standard of mass.\n\nSuch, then, were some of the scientific results which followed in this\ncase from bringing together mathematical power, experimental sagacity,\nand manipulative skill, to direct and assist the labours of a body of\nzealous observers.  If therefore we desire, for our own advantage and\nfor the honour of our University, that the Devonshire Laboratory\nshould be successful, we must endeavour to maintain it in living union\nwith the other organs and faculties of our learned body.  We shall\ntherefore first consider the relation in which we stand to those\nmathematical studies which have so long flourished among us, which\ndeal with our own subjects, and which differ from our experimental\nstudies only in the mode in which they are presented to the mind.\n\nThere is no more powerful method for introducing knowledge into the\nmind than that of presenting it in as many different ways as we can.\nWhen the ideas, after entering through different gateways, effect a\njunction in the citadel of the mind, the position they occupy becomes\nimpregnable.  Opticians tell us that the mental combination of the\nviews of an object which we obtain from stations no further apart than\nour two eyes is sufficient to produce in our minds an impression of\nthe solidity of the object seen; and we find that this impression is\nproduced even when we are aware that we are really looking at two flat\npictures placed in a stereoscope.  It is therefore natural to expect\nthat the knowledge of physical science obtained by the combined use of\nmathematical analysis and experimental research will be of a more\nsolid, available, and enduring kind than that possessed by the mere\nmathematician or the mere experimenter.\n\nBut what will be the effect on the University, if men Pursuing that\ncourse of reading which has produced so many distinguished Wranglers,\nturn aside to work experiments?  Will not their attendance at the\nLaboratory count not merely as time withdrawn from their more\nlegitimate studies, but as the introduction of a disturbing element,\ntainting their mathematical conceptions with material imagery, and\nsapping their faith in the formulae of the textbook?  Besides this, we\nhave already heard complaints of the undue extension of our studies,\nand of the strain put upon our questionists by the weight of learning\nwhich they try to carry with them into the Senate-House.  If we now\nask them to get up their subjects not only by books and writing, but\nat the same time by observation and manipulation, will they not break\ndown altogether?  The Physical Laboratory, we are told, may perhaps be\nuseful to those who are going out in Natural Science, and who do\nnot take in Mathematics, but to attempt to combine both kinds of study\nduring the time of residence at the University is more than one mind\ncan bear.\n\nNo doubt there is some reason for this feeling.  Many of us have\nalready overcome the initial difficulties of mathematical training.\nWhen we now go on with our study, we feel that it requires exertion\nand involves fatigue, but we are confident that if we only work hard\nour progress will be certain.\n\nSome of us, on the other hand, may have had some experience of the\nroutine of experimental work.  As soon as we can read scales, observe\ntimes, focus telescopes, and so on, this kind of work ceases to\nrequire any great mental effort.  We may perhaps tire our eyes and\nweary our backs, but we do not greatly fatigue our minds.\n\nIt is not till we attempt to bring the theoretical part of our\ntraining into contact with the practical that we begin to experience\nthe full effect of what Faraday has called \"mental inertia\"--not only\nthe difficulty of recognising, among the concrete objects before us,\nthe abstract relation which we have learned from books, but the\ndistracting pain of wrenching the mind away from the symbols to the\nobjects, and from the objects back to the symbols.  This however is\nthe price we have to pay for new ideas.\n\nBut when we have overcome these difficulties, and successfully bridged\nover the gulph between the abstract and the concrete, it is not a mere\npiece of knowledge that we have obtained: we have acquired the\nrudiment of a permanent mental endowment.  When, by a repetition of\nefforts of this kind, we have more fully developed the scientific\nfaculty, the exercise of this faculty in detecting scientific\nprinciples in nature, and in directing practice by theory, is no\nlonger irksome, but becomes an unfailing source of enjoyment, to which\nwe return so often, that at last even our careless thoughts begin to\nrun in a scientific channel.\n\nI quite admit that our mental energy is limited in quantity, and I\nknow that many zealous students try to do more than is good for them.\nBut the question about the introduction of experimental study is not\nentirely one of quantity.  It is to a great extent a question of\ndistribution of energy.  Some distributions of energy, we know, are\nmore useful than others, because they are more available for those\npurposes which we desire to accomplish.\n\nNow in the case of study, a great part of our fatigue often arises,\nnot from those mental efforts by which we obtain the mastery of the\nsubject, but from those which are spent in recalling our wandering\nthoughts; and these efforts of attention would be much less fatiguing\nif the disturbing force of mental distraction could be removed.\n\nThis is the reason why a man whose soul is in his work always makes\nmore progress than one whose aim is something not immediately\nconnected with his occupation.  In the latter case the very motive of\nwhich he makes use to stimulate his flagging powers becomes the means\nof distracting his mind from the work before him.\n\nThere may be some mathematicians who pursue their studies entirely for\ntheir own sake.  Most men, however, think that the chief use of\nmathematics is found in the interpretation of nature.  Now a man who\nstudies a piece of mathematics in order to understand some natural\nphenomenon which he has seen, or to calculate the best arrangement of\nsome experiment which he means to make, is likely to meet with far\nless distraction of mind than if his sole aim had been to sharpen his\nmind for the successful practice of the Law, or to obtain a high place\nin the Mathematical Tripos.\n\nI have known men, who when they were at school, never could see the\ngood of mathematics, but who, when in after life they made this\ndiscovery, not only became eminent as scientific engineers, but made\nconsiderable progress in the study of abstract mathematics.  If our\nexperimental course should help any of you to see the good of\nmathematics, it will relieve us of much anxiety, for it will not only\nensure the success of your future studies, but it will make it much\nless likely that they will prove injurious to your health.\n\n\nBut why should we labour to prove the advantage of practical science\nto the University?  Let us rather speak of the help which the\nUniversity may give to science, when men well trained in mathematics\nand enjoying the advantages of a well-appointed Laboratory, shall\nunite their efforts to carry out some experimental research which no\nsolitary worker could attempt.\n\nAt first it is probable that our principal experimental work must be\nthe illustration of particular branches of science, but as we go on we\nmust add to this the study of scientific methods, the same method\nbeing sometimes illustrated by its application to researches belonging\nto different branches of science.\n\nWe might even imagine a course of experimental study the arrangement\nof which should be founded on a classification of methods, and not on\nthat of the objects of investigation.  A combination of the two plans\nseems to me better than either, and while we take every opportunity of\nstudying methods, we shall take care not to dissociate the method from\nthe scientific research to which it is applied, and to which it owes\nits value.\n\nWe shall therefore arrange our lectures according to the\nclassification of the principal natural phenomena, such as heat,\nelectricity, magnetism and so on.\n\nIn the laboratory, on the other hand, the place of the different\ninstruments will be determined by a classification according to\nmethods, such as weighing and measuring, observations of time, optical\nand electrical methods of observation, and so on.\n\nThe determination of the experiments to be performed at a particular\ntime must often depend upon the means we have at command, and in the\ncase of the more elaborate experiments, this may imply a long time of\npreparation, during which the instruments, the methods, and the\nobservers themselves, are being gradually fitted for their work.  When\nwe have thus brought together the requisites, both material and\nintellectual, for a particular experiment, it may sometimes be\ndesirable that before the instruments are dismounted and the observers\ndispersed, we should make some other experiment, requiring the same\nmethod, but dealing perhaps with an entirely different class of\nphysical phenomena.\n\nOur principal work, however, in the Laboratory must be to acquaint\nourselves with all kinds of scientific methods, to compare them, and\nto estimate their value.  It will, I think, be a result worthy of our\nUniversity, and more likely to be accomplished here than in any\nprivate laboratory, if, by the free and full discussion of the\nrelative value of different scientific procedures, we succeed in\nforming a school of scientific criticism, and in assisting the\ndevelopment of the doctrine of method.\n\nBut admitting that a practical acquaintance with the methods of\nPhysical Science is an essential part of a mathematical and scientific\neducation, we may be asked whether we are not attributing too much\nimportance to science altogether as part of a liberal education.\n\nFortunately, there is no question here whether the University should\ncontinue to be a place of liberal education, or should devote itself\nto preparing young men for particular professions.  Hence though some\nof us may, I hope, see reason to make the pursuit of science the main\nbusiness of our lives, it must be one of our most constant aims to\nmaintain a living connexion between our work and the other liberal\nstudies of Cambridge, whether literary, philological, historical or\nphilosophical.\n\nThere is a narrow professional spirit which may grow up among men of\nscience, just as it does among men who practise any other special\nbusiness.  But surely a University is the very place where we should\nbe able to overcome this tendency of men to become, as it were,\ngranulated into small worlds, which are all the more worldly for their\nvery smallness.  We lose the advantage of having men of varied\npursuits collected into one body, if we do not endeavour to imbibe\nsome of the spirit even of those whose special branch of learning is\ndifferent from our own.\n\nIt is not so long ago since any man who devoted himself to geometry,\nor to any science requiring continued application, was looked upon as\nnecessarily a misanthrope, who must have abandoned all human\ninterests, and betaken himself to abstractions so far removed from the\nworld of life and action that he has become insensible alike to the\nattractions of pleasure and to the claims of duty.\n\nIn the present day, men of science are not looked upon with the same\nawe or with the same suspicion.  They are supposed to be in league\nwith the material spirit of the age, and to form a kind of advanced\nRadical party among men of learning.\n\nWe are not here to defend literary and historical studies.  We admit\nthat the proper study of mankind is man.  But is the student of\nscience to be withdrawn from the study of man, or cut off from every\nnoble feeling, so long as he lives in intellectual fellowship with men\nwho have devoted their lives to the discovery of truth, and the\nresults of whose enquiries have impressed themselves on the ordinary\nspeech and way of thinking of men who never heard their names?  Or is\nthe student of history and of man to omit from his consideration the\nhistory of the origin and diffusion of those ideas which have produced\nso great a difference between one age of the world and another?\n\nIt is true that the history of science is very different from the\nscience of history.  We are not studying or attempting to study the\nworking of those blind forces which, we are told, are operating on\ncrowds of obscure people, shaking principalities and powers, and\ncompelling reasonable men to bring events to pass in an order laid\ndown by philosophers.\n\nThe men whose names are found in the history of science are not mere\nhypothetical constituents of a crowd, to be reasoned upon only in\nmasses.  We recognise them as men like ourselves, and their actions\nand thoughts, being more free from the influence of passion, and\nrecorded more accurately than those of other men, are all the better\nmaterials for the study of the calmer parts of human nature.\n\nBut the history of science is not restricted to the enumeration of\nsuccessful investigations.  It has to tell of unsuccessful inquiries,\nand to explain why some of the ablest men have failed to find the key\nof knowledge, and how the reputation of others has only given a firmer\nfooting to the errors into which they fell.\n\nThe history of the development, whether normal or abnormal, of ideas\nis of all subjects that in which we, as thinking men, take the deepest\ninterest.  But when the action of the mind passes out of the\nintellectual stage, in which truth and error are the alternatives,\ninto the more violently emotional states of anger and passion, malice\nand envy, fury and madness; the student of science, though he is\nobliged to recognise the powerful influence which these wild forces\nhave exercised on mankind, is perhaps in some measure disqualified\nfrom pursuing the study of this part of human nature.\n\nBut then how few of us are capable of deriving profit from such\nstudies.  We cannot enter into full sympathy with these lower phases\nof our nature without losing some of that antipathy to them which is\nour surest safeguard against a reversion to a meaner type, and we\ngladly return to the company of those illustrious men who by aspiring\nto noble ends, whether intellectual or practical, have risen above the\nregion of storms into a clearer atmosphere, where there is no\nmisrepresentation of opinion, nor ambiguity of expression, but where\none mind comes into closest contact with another at the point where\nboth approach nearest to the truth.\n\n\nI propose to lecture during this term on Heat, and, as our facilities\nfor experimental work are not yet fully developed, I shall endeavour\nto place before you the relative position and scientific connexion of\nthe different branches of the science, rather than to discuss the\ndetails of experimental methods.\n\nWe shall begin with Thermometry, or the registration of temperatures,\nand Calorimetry, or the measurement of quantities of heat.  We shall\nthen go on to Thermodynamics, which investigates the relations between\nthe thermal properties of bodies and their other dynamical properties,\nin so far as these relations may be traced without any assumption as\nto the particular constitution of these bodies.\n\nThe principles of Thermodynamics throw great light on all the\nphenomena of nature, and it is probable that many valuable\napplications of these principles have yet to be made; but we shall\nhave to point out the limits of this science, and to shew that many\nproblems in nature, especially those in which the Dissipation of\nEnergy comes into play, are not capable of solution by the principles\nof Thermodynamics alone, but that in order to understand them, we are\nobliged to form some more definite theory of the constitution of\nbodies.\n\nTwo theories of the constitution of bodies have struggled for victory\nwith various fortunes since the earliest ages of speculation: one is\nthe theory of a universal plenum, the other is that of atoms and void.\n\nThe theory of the plenum is associated with the doctrine of\nmathematical continuity, and its mathematical methods are those of the\nDifferential Calculus, which is the appropriate expression of the\nrelations of continuous quantity.\n\nThe theory of atoms and void leads us to attach more importance to the\ndoctrines of integral numbers and definite proportions; but, in\napplying dynamical principles to the motion of immense numbers of\natoms, the limitation of our faculties forces us to abandon the\nattempt to express the exact history of each atom, and to be content\nwith estimating the average condition of a group of atoms large enough\nto be visible.  This method of dealing with groups of atoms, which I\nmay call the statistical method, and which in the present state of our\nknowledge is the only available method of studying the properties of\nreal bodies, involves an abandonment of strict dynamical principles,\nand an adoption of the mathematical methods belonging to the theory of\nprobability.  It is probable that important results will be obtained\nby the application of this method, which is as yet little known and is\nnot familiar to our minds.  If the actual history of Science had been\ndifferent, and if the scientific doctrines most familiar to us had\nbeen those which must be expressed in this way, it is possible that we\nmight have considered the existence of a certain kind of contingency a\nself-evident truth, and treated the doctrine of philosophical\nnecessity as a mere sophism.\n\nAbout the beginning of this century, the properties of bodies were\ninvestigated by several distinguished French mathematicians on the\nhypothesis that they are systems of molecules in equilibrium.  The\nsomewhat unsatisfactory nature of the results of these investigations\nproduced, especially in this country, a reaction in favour of the\nopposite method of treating bodies as if they were, so far at least as\nour experiments are concerned, truly continuous.  This method, in the\nhands of Green, Stokes, and others, has led to results, the value of\nwhich does not at all depend on what theory we adopt as to the\nultimate constitution of bodies.\n\nOne very important result of the investigation of the properties of\nbodies on the hypothesis that they are truly continuous is that it\nfurnishes us with a test by which we can ascertain, by experiments on\na real body, to what degree of tenuity it must be reduced before it\nbegins to give evidence that its properties are no longer the same as\nthose of the body in mass.  Investigations of this kind, combined with\na study of various phenomena of diffusion and of dissipation of\nenergy, have recently added greatly to the evidence in favour of the\nhypothesis that bodies are systems of molecules in motion.\n\nI hope to be able to lay before you in the course of the term some of\nthe evidence for the existence of molecules, considered as individual\nbodies having definite properties.  The molecule, as it is presented to\nthe scientific imagination, is a very different body from any of those\nwith which experience has hitherto made us acquainted.\n\nIn the first place its mass, and the other constants which define its\nproperties, are absolutely invariable; the individual molecule can\nneither grow nor decay, but remains unchanged amid all the changes of\nthe bodies of which it may form a constituent.\n\nIn the second place it is not the only molecule of its kind, for there\nare innumerable other molecules, whose constants are not\napproximately, but absolutely identical with those of the first\nmolecule, and this whether they are found on the earth, in the sun, or\nin the fixed stars.\n\nBy what process of evolution the philosophers of the future will\nattempt to account for this identity in the properties of such a\nmultitude of bodies, each of them unchangeable in magnitude, and some\nof them separated from others by distances which Astronomy attempts in\nvain to measure, I cannot conjecture.  My mind is limited in its power\nof speculation, and I am forced to believe that these molecules must\nhave been made as they are from the beginning of their existence.\n\nI also conclude that since none of the processes of nature, during\ntheir varied action on different individual molecules, have produced,\nin the course of ages, the slightest difference between the properties\nof one molecule and those of another, the history of whose\ncombinations has been different, we cannot ascribe either their\nexistence or the identity of their properties to the operation of any\nof those causes which we call natural.\n\nIs it true then that our scientific speculations have really\npenetrated beneath the visible appearance of things, which seem to be\nsubject to generation and corruption, and reached the entrance of that\nworld of order and perfection, which continues this day as it was\ncreated, perfect in number and measure and weight?\n\nWe may be mistaken.  No one has as yet seen or handled an individual\nmolecule, and our molecular hypothesis may, in its turn, be supplanted\nby some new theory of the constitution of matter; but the idea of the\nexistence of unnumbered individual things, all alike and all\nunchangeable, is one which cannot enter the human mind and remain\nwithout fruit.\n\nBut what if these molecules, indestructible as they are, turn out to\nbe not substances themselves, but mere affections of some other\nsubstance?\n\nAccording to Sir W. Thomson's theory of Vortex Atoms, the substance of\nwhich the molecule consists is a uniformly dense _plenum_, the\nproperties of which are those of a perfect fluid, the molecule itself\nbeing nothing but a certain motion impressed on a portion of this\nfluid, and this motion is shewn, by a theorem due to Helmholtz, to be\nas indestructible as we believe a portion of matter to be.\n\nIf a theory of this kind is true, or even if it is conceivable, our\nidea of matter may have been introduced into our minds through our\nexperience of those systems of vortices which we call bodies, but\nwhich are not substances, but motions of a substance; and yet the idea\nwhich we have thus acquired of matter, as a substance possessing\ninertia, may be truly applicable to that fluid of which the vortices\nare the motion, but of whose existence, apart from the vortical motion\nof some of its parts, our experience gives us no evidence whatever.\n\nIt has been asserted that metaphysical speculation is a thing of the\npast, and that physical science has extirpated it.  The discussion of\nthe categories of existence, however, does not appear to be in danger\nof coming to an end in our time, and the exercise of speculation\ncontinues as fascinating to every fresh mind as it was in the days of\nThales.\n\nTitle: Practical Mechanics for Boys\n\nAuthor: James Slough Zerbe\n\nRelease date: August 11, 2007 [eBook #22298]\n                Most recently updated: January 2, 2021\n\nLanguage: English\n\nCredits: Produced by Joe Longo and the Online Distributed\n        Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRACTICAL MECHANICS FOR BOYS ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Joe Longo and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE \"HOW-TO-DO-IT\" BOOKS\n\nPRACTICAL MECHANICS FOR BOYS\n\n\n\n\nTHE \"HOW-TO-DO-IT\" BOOKS\n\nPRACTICAL MECHANICS\nFOR BOYS\n\nIn language which every boy can understand\nand so arranged that he may readily carry\nout any work from the instructions given.\n\nWITH MANY ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nBy J.

There he is bound for a certain term of years, and with\nthe prime object of teaching him to become an artisan. More often than\notherwise he pays for this privilege, and he knows it is incumbent on\nhim \"to make good\" right from the start.\n\nHe labors under the disadvantage, however, that he has a certain tenure,\nand in that course he is not pushed forward from one step to the next on\naccount of any merit of his own. His advancement is fixed by the time he\nhas put in at each part of the work, and thus no note is taken of his\nindividuality.\n\nHere the boy rises step after step by virtue of his own qualifications,\nand we recognize that one boy has the capacity to learn faster than\nanother. If he can learn in one year what it requires three in another\nto acquire, in order to do it as perfectly, it is an injury to the apt\nworkman to be held back and deterred from making his way upwardly.\n\nIt may be urged that the apprentice system instills thoroughness. This\nmay be true; but it also does another thing: It makes the man a mere\nmachine. The true workman is a thinker. He is ever on the alert to find\neasier, quicker and more efficient means for doing certain work.\n\nWhat is called \"Efficiency\" in labor methods, can never obtain in an\napprenticeship system for this reason. In a certain operation, where\ntwelve motions are required to do a certain thing, and a minute to\nperform the twelve operations, a simplified way, necessitating only\neight motions, means a difference in saving one-third of the time. The\nnineteen hundred fewer particular movements in a day's work, being a\nless strain on the operator, both physically and mentally, to say\nnothing whatever of the advantages which the proprietor of the shop\nwould gain.\n\nI make this a leading text in the presentation of this book; namely,\nthat individual merit and stimulus is something of such extreme\nimportance that it should be made the keynote for every boy who tries to\nbecome a mechanic.\n\nThe machinist easily occupies a leading place in the multitude of trades\nand occupations. There is hardly an article of use but comes to the\nmarket through his hands. His labor is most diverse, and in his\nemployment doing machine work he is called upon to do things which vary\nwidely in their character.\n\nThese require special knowledge, particular tools, and more frequently\nthan otherwise, a high order of inventive ability to enable him to\naccomplish the task.\n\nThe boy should be taught, at the outset, that certain things must be\nlearned thoroughly, and that habits in a machine shop can be bad as well\nas good. When he once becomes accustomed to putting a tool back in its\nrightful place the moment he is through with it, he has taken a long\nstep toward efficiency.\n\nWhen he grasps a tool and presents it to the work without turning it\nover several times, or has acquired the knack of picking up the right\ntool at the proper place, he is making strides in the direction of\nbecoming a rapid and skilled workman.\n\nThese, and many other things of like import, will require our attention\nthroughout the various chapters.\n\nIt is not the intention of the book to make every boy who reads and\nstudies it, a machinist; nor have we any desire to present a lot of\nuseful articles as samples of what to make. The object is to show the\nboy what are the requirements necessary to make him a machinist; how to\nhold, handle, sharpen and grind the various tools; the proper ones to\nuse for each particular character of work; how the various machines are\nhandled and cared for; the best materials to use; and suggest the\nnumerous things which can be done in a shop which will pave the way for\nmaking his work pleasant as well as profitable.\n\nIt also analyzes the manner in which the job is laid out; how to set the\ntools to get the most effective work; and explains what is meant by\nmaking a finished piece of workmanship. These things, properly acquired,\neach must determine in his own mind whether he is adapted to follow up\nthe work.\n\nOver and above all, we shall try to give the boy some stimulus for his\nwork. Unless he takes an interest in what he is doing, he will never\nbecome an artisan in the true sense of the word.\n\nGo through the book, and see whether, here and there, you do not get\nsome glimpses of what it means to take a pleasure in doing each\nparticular thing, and you will find in every instance that it is a\nsatisfaction because you have learned to perform it with ease.\n\nI do not know of anything which has done as much to advance the arts and\nmanufactures, during the last century, as the universal desire to\nimprove the form, shape and structure of tools; and the effort to invent\nnew ones. This finds its reflection everywhere in the production of new\nand improved products.\n\nIn this particular I have been led to formulate a homely sentence which\nexpresses the idea: Invention consists in doing an old thing a new way;\nor a new thing any way.\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nON TOOLS GENERALLY\n\n\nJudging from the favorable comments of educators, on the general\narrangement of the subject matter in the work on \"Carpentry for Boys,\" I\nam disposed to follow that plan in this book in so far as it pertains to\ntools.\n\nIn this field, as in \"Carpentry,\" I do not find any guide which is\nadapted to teach the boy the fundamentals of mechanics. Writers usually\noverlook the fact, that as the boy knows nothing whatever about the\nsubject, he could not be expected to know anything about tools.\n\nTo describe them gives a start in the education, but it is far short of\nwhat is necessary for one in his condition. If he is told that the\nchisel or bit for a lathe has a diamond point, or is round-nosed, and\nmust be ground at a certain angle, he naturally wants to know, as all\nboys do, _why_ it should be at that angle.\n\nSo in the setting of the tools with relation to the work, the holding\nand manipulation of the file, of the drill for accurate boring, together\nwith numerous little things, are all taken for granted, and the boy\nblunders along with the ultimate object in sight, without having the\npathway cleared so he may readily reach the goal.\n\nVARIED REQUIREMENTS.--The machinist's trade is one which requires the\nmost varied tools of all occupations, and they are by all odds the most\nexpensive to be found in the entire list of vocations.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1. Bench Vise._]\n\nThis arises from the fact that he must work with the most stubborn of\nall materials. He finds resistance at every step in bringing forth a\nproduct.\n\nLIST OF TOOLS.--With a view of familiarizing the boy with this great\nvariety the following list is compiled, from which we shall select the\nones essential in the initial equipment of a small shop.\n\nVISES.--One small, good vise is infinitely preferable to two bad ones.\nFor ordinary work a 3-inch jaw is preferable, and it should be firmly\nmounted on the bench. So many kinds are now made that it would be a\ncostly thing to purchase one for each special use, therefore the boy\nwill find it profitable to make some attachments for the ordinary vise.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2. Pipe Grip for Vise._]\n\nSWIVEL VISES.--A swivel vise is always a good tool, the cost being not\nexcessive over the ordinary kind. Then a pair of grips for holding pipe,\nor round material which is to be threaded, can readily be made.\n\nThe drawing (Fig. 2) shows a serviceable pair of grips, made to fit the\njaws of a vise, and will be acceptable in much of the work. Then, the\nvise should be provided with copper caps for the jaws to be used when\nmaking up articles which would otherwise be injured by the jaws.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3. Swivel Vise._]\n\nLet us get a comprehensive view of the different kinds of tools\nnecessary in a fully equipped shop.\n\nPARTS OF LATHE.--The first thing of importance is the lathe, and of\nthese there is quite a variety, and among the accompaniments are the\nslide rest, mandrel, back gear, division plate, angle plate, cone plate\nand various chucks.\n\nThere must also be change wheels, studs and quadrant plates, self-acting\nfeed for surfacing and cross slide, and clamping nuts.\n\nDrilling machines, both hand and power, hand and ratchet braces and\nbreast-drill stocks.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4--Speed Lathe._]\n\nCHISELS.--Chisels of various kinds, for chipping and cross-cutting;\nround-nosed, centering, set punches, tommies and drifts.\n\nBack, tee and centering square; bevels, spirit level, inside and outside\ncalipers, straight edges, rules and surface plates.\n\nGages for boring, scribing blocks, steel and brass scribes, stocks and\ndies, screw-plates, taps for bolts, reamers.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 5. Calipers_]\n\nFiles for various descriptions, countersinks, frame and hack saws.\n\nGRINDING APPARATUS.--Emery wheel, cloth and paper, paper, flour emery,\npolishing powders, laps and buffs, and polishing sticks.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6. Engine Lathe._\n _A. Lathe Bed_\n _B. Rack Gear_\n _C. Live Center_\n _D. Dead Center_\n _E. Dead Spindle_\n _F. Face Plate_\n _G. Feed Screw_\n _H. Train of Gears_\n _I. Head Stock_\n _J. Mandrel_\n _K. Cone Pulley_\n _L. Angle Plate for Tool Holder_\n _M. Tool Post_\n _N. Tail Stock_\n _O. Wheel for Slide Rest Mechanism_\n _P. Locking Lever for Tail Stock._]\n\nForge, anvils, tongs, swages, punches, bolt tools, hot and cold chisels,\nblow-pipe, soldering iron, hard and soft solders, borax, spirits of\nsalts, oil, resin and spelter.\n\nTo this may be added an endless variety of small bench tools,\nmicrometers, protractors, arbors, collets, box tools and scrapers.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 7. Center Gage._]\n\nLARGE MACHINES.--The list would not be complete without the planer,\nshaper and milling machine, with their variety of chucks, clamps and\nother attachments, too numerous to mention.\n\nThe foregoing show what a wonderful variety of articles are found in a\nwell-equipped shop, all of which can be conveniently used; but to the\nboy who has only a small amount of money, a workable set is indicated as\nfollows:\n\nA small lathe, with an 8-inch swing, can be obtained at a low cost,\nprovided with a countershaft complete.\n\nCHUCKS.--With this should go a small chuck, and a face-plate for large\nwork, unless a large chuck can also be acquired. This, with a dozen\ntools of various sizes, and also small bits for drilling purposes.\n\nThe lathe will answer all purposes for drilling, but small drilling\nmachines are now furnished at very low figures, and such a machine will\ntake off a great deal of duty from the lathe.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 8. Pocket Screw and Wire Gage._]\n\nAs the lathe is of prime importance, never use it for drilling, if you\nhave a driller, as it always has enough work to do for tuning up work.\n\nBENCH TOOLS.--Of bench tools, a 3-inch vise, various files, center\npunch, two hammers, round and A-shaped peons, hack saw, compasses,\ninside and outside calipers, screw driver, cold chisels, metal square,\nlevel, straight edge, bevel square, reamers, small emery wheel and an\noil stone, make a fairly good outfit to start with, and these can be\nadded to from time to time.\n\nEverything in the machine shop centers about the lathe. It is the king\nof all tools. The shaper and planer may be most efficient for surfacing,\nand the milling machine for making grooves and gears, or for general\ncutting purposes, but the lathe possesses a range of work not possible\nwith either of the other tools, and for that reason should be selected\nwith great care.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 9. Handy Bench Vise._]\n\nSELECTING A LATHE.--The important things about a lathe are the spindle\nbearings and the ways for the tool-holder. The least play in either will\nruin any work. Every other part may be defective, but with solidly\nbuilt bearing-posts and bearings, your lathe will be effective.\n\nFor this reason it will not pay to get a cheap tool. Better get a small,\n6-inch approved tool of this kind, than a larger cheap article. It may\npay with other tools, but with a lathe never.\n\nNever do grinding on a lathe. The fine emery, or grinding material, is\nsure to reach the bearings; it matters not what care is exercised. There\nis only one remedy for this--overhauling.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 10.--Combination Square._]\n\nCOMBINATION SQUARE.--A tool of this kind is most essential, however\nsmall. It can be used as a try-square, and has this advantage, that the\nhead can be made to slide along the rule and be clamped at any point. It\nhas a beveling and a leveling device, as well.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 11.--Uses of the Combination Square._]\n\nThe combination square provides a means for doing a great variety of\nwork, as it combines the qualities of a rule, square, miter, depth gage,\nheight gage, level and center head.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 12.--A Quick Adjusting Micrometer._]\n\nThe full page illustration (Fig. 11) shows some of the uses and the\nparticular manner of holding the tool.\n\nMICROMETERS.--Tools of this description are made which will accurately\nmeasure work in dimensions of ten-thousandths of an inch up to an inch.\n\nThe illustration (Fig. 12) shows an approved tool, and this is so\nconstructed that it can instantly be changed and set by merely pressing\nthe end of the plunger as shown.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 13.--A Universal Bevel Protractor._]\n\nPROTRACTORS.--As all angles are not obtainable by the square or bevel, a\nprotractor is a most desirable addition to the stock of tools. As one\nside of the tool is flat it is convenient for laying on the paper when\ndrafting, as well as for use on the work.\n\nThe protractor has a graduated disk, and is adjustable so it can be\ndisposed at any angle.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 14.--Universal Bevel Protractor, showing its\nuses._]\n\nAll special tools of this kind are serviceable, and the boy should\nunderstand their uses, even though he is not able for the time being to\nacquire them. To learn how they are applied in daily use is an education\nin itself.\n\nUTILIZING BEVEL PROTRACTOR.--Examine the full-page illustration (Fig.\n14), and see how the bevel protractor is utilized to measure the angles\nof work, whether it is tapering heads or different kinds of nuts, or end\nand side surfacing, and it will teach an important lesson.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 15.--Grindstone Truing Device._]\n\nTRUING GRINDSTONES.--Devices for truing up grindstones are now made, and\nthe illustration (Fig. 15) shows a very efficient machine for this\npurpose. It can be applied instantly to the face of the stone, and it\nworks automatically, without interfering with the use of the stone.\n\nIt is frequently the case that an emery wheel will become glazed, due to\nits extreme hardness. This is also caused, sometimes, by running it at\ntoo high a speed. If the glazing continues after the speed is reduced,\nit should be ground down an eighth of an inch or so. This will, usually,\nremedy the defect.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 16.--Set of Tools and Case._]\n\nSETS OF TOOLS.--A cheap and convenient set of precision tools is shown\nin Fig. 16, which is kept in a neat folding leather case. The set\nconsists of a 6-inch combination square, complete center punch, 6-inch\nflexible steel rule center gage, 4-inch calipers, 4-inch outside caliper\nwith solid nut, 4-inch inside caliper with solid nut, and a 4-inch\ndivider with a solid nut.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 17. The Work Bench._]\n\nTHE WORK BENCH.--This is the mechanic's fort. His capacity for work will\ndepend on its arrangement. To the boy this is particularly interesting,\nand for his uses it should be made full three inches lower than the\nstandard height.\n\nA good plan to judge of the proper height is to measure from the jaws of\nthe vise. The top of the jaw should be on a level with the elbows. Grasp\na file with both hands, and hold it as though in the act of filing\nacross the work; then measure up from the floor to the elbows, when they\nare held in that position.\n\nTHE PROPER DIMENSIONS.--This plan will give you a sure means of\nselecting a height that is best adapted for your work. The regulation\nbench is about 38 inches high, and assuming that the vise projects up\nabout 4 inches more, would bring the top of the jaws about 42 to 44\ninches from the floor. It is safe to fix the height of the bench at not\nless than 34 inches.\n\nThis should have a drawer, preferably near the right-hand end of the\nbench. The vise should be at the left side, and the bench in your front\nshould be free of any fixed tools.\n\nHOW ARRANGED.--Have a rack above the bench at the rear, for the various\ntools when not in use, and the rear board of the bench should be\nelevated above the front planks several inches, on which the various\ntools can be put, other than those which are suspended on the rack\nabove.\n\nThe advantage of this is, that a bench will accumulate a quantity of\nmaterial that the tools can hide in, and there is nothing more annoying\nthan to hunt over a lot of trash to get what is needed. It is necessary\nto emphasize the necessity of always putting a tool back in its proper\nplace, immediately after using.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHOW TO GRIND AND SHARPEN TOOLS\n\n\nIt is singular, that with the immense variety of tools set forth in the\npreceding chapter, how few, really, require the art of the workman to\ngrind and sharpen. If we take the lathe, the drilling machine, as well\nas the shaper, planer, milling machine, and all power-driven tools, they\nare merely mechanism contrived to handle some small, and, apparently,\ninconsequential tool, which does the work on the material.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE CUTTING TOOL.--But it is this very fact that makes the\npreparation of that part of the mechanism so important. Here we have a\nlathe, weighing a thousand pounds, worth hundreds of dollars,\nconcentrating its entire energies on a little bit, weighing eight\nounces, and worth less than a dollar. It may thus readily be seen that\nit is the little bar of metal from which the small tool is made that\nneeds our care and attention.\n\nThis is particularly true of the expensive milling machines, where the\nlittle saw, if not in perfect order, and not properly set, will not only\ndo improper work, but injure the machine itself. More lathes are ruined\nfrom using badly ground tools than from any other cause.\n\nIn the whole line of tools which the machinist must take care of daily,\nthere is nothing as important as the lathe cutting-tool, and the\nknowledge which goes with it to use the proper one.\n\nLet us simplify the inquiry by considering them under the following\nheadings:\n\n1. The grinder.\n\n2. The grinding angle.\n\nTHE GRINDER.--The first mistake the novice will make, is to use the tool\non the grinder as though it were necessary to grind it down with a few\nturns of the wheel. Haste is not conducive to proper sharpening. As the\nwheel is of emery, corundum or other quickly cutting material, and is\nalways run at a high rate of speed, a great heat is evolved, which is\nmaterially increased by pressure.\n\nPressure is injurious not so much to the wheel as to the tool itself.\nThe moment a tool becomes heated there is danger of destroying the\ntemper, and the edge, being the thinnest, is the most violently\naffected. Hence it is desirable always to have a receptacle with water\nhandy, into which the tool can be plunged, during the process of\ngrinding down.\n\nCORRECT USE OF GRINDER.--Treat the wheel as though it is a friend, and\nnot an enemy. Take advantage of its entire surface. Whenever you go into\na machine shop, look at the emery wheel. If you find it worn in creases,\nand distorted in its circular outline, you can make up your mind that\nthere is some one there who has poor tools, because it is simply out of\nthe question to grind a tool correctly with such a wheel.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 18. Hook Tool._]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 19. Parting Tool._]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 20. Knife Tool._]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 21. Right-hand Side Tool._]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 22. Internal Tool._]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 23. Left-hand Side Tool._]\n\nCoarse wheels are an abomination for tool work. Use the finest kinds\ndevised for the purpose. They will keep in condition longer, are not so\nliable to wear unevenly, and will always finish off the edge better than\nthe coarse variety.\n\nLATHE BITS.--All bits made for lathes are modifications of the foregoing\ntypes (Figs. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).\n\nAs this chapter deals with the sharpening methods only, the reader is\nreferred to the next chapter, which deals with the manner of setting\nand holding them to do the most effective work.\n\nWhen it is understood that a cutting tool in a lathe is simply a form of\nwedge which peels off a definite thickness of metal, the importance of\nproper grinding and correct position in the lathe can be appreciated.\n\nROUGHING TOOLS.--The most useful is the roughing tool to take off the\nfirst cut. As this type of tool is also important, with some\nmodifications, in finishing work, it is given the place of first\nconsideration here.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 24. Tool for Wrought iron._ _Fig. 25. Tool for Cast\niron._]\n\nFig. 24 shows side and top views of a tool designed to rough off wrought\niron, or a tough quality of steel. You will notice, that what is called\nthe top rake (A) is very pronounced, and, as the point projects\nconsiderably above the body of the tool itself, it should, in practice,\nbe set with its cutting point above the center.\n\nTHE CLEARANCE.--Now, in grinding, the important point is the clearance\nline (B). As shown in this figure, it has an angle of 10 degrees, so\nthat in placing the tool in the holder it is obvious it cannot be placed\nvery high above the center, particularly when used on small work. The\ntop rake is ground at an angle of 60 degrees from the vertical. The arc\nof the curved end depends on the kind of lathe and the size of the work.\n\nThe tool (Fig. 25), with a straight cutting edge, is the proper one to\nrough off cast iron. Note that the top rake (C) is 70 degrees, and the\nclearance 15 degrees.\n\nTHE CUTTING ANGLE.--Wrought iron, or mild steel, will form a ribbon when\nthe tool wedges its way into the material. Cast iron, on the other hand,\nowing to its brittleness, will break off into small particles, hence the\nwedge surface can be put at a more obtuse angle to the work.\n\nIn grinding side-cutters the clearance should be at a less angle than 10\ndegrees, rather than more, and the top rake should also be less;\notherwise the tendency will be to draw the tool into the work and swing\nthe tool post around.\n\nDRILLS.--Holders for grinding twist drills are now furnished at very low\nprices, and instructions are usually sent with the machines, but a few\nwords may not be amiss for the benefit of those who have not the means\nto purchase such a machine.\n\nHand grinding is a difficult thing, for the reason that through\ncarelessness, or inability, both sides of the drill are not ground at\nthe same angle and pitch. As a result the cutting edge of one side will\ndo more work than the other. If the heel angles differ, one side will\ndraw into the work, and the other resist.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 26. End view._ _Fig. 27. Side view._]\n\nWRONG GRINDING.--When such is the case the hole becomes untrue. The\nsides of the bit will grind into the walls, or the bit will have a\ntendency to run to one side, and particularly if boring through metal\nwhich is uneven in its texture or grain.\n\nFigs. 26 and 27 show end and side views of a bit properly ground. If a\nbit has been broken off, first grind it off square at the end, and then\ngrind down the angles, so that A is about 15 degrees, and be sure that\nthe heel has sufficient clearance--that is, ground down deeper than the\ncutting point.\n\nCHISELS.--A machine shop should always have a plentiful supply of cold\nchisels, and a particular kind for each work, to be used for that\npurpose only. This may seem trivial to the boy, but it is really a most\nimportant matter.\n\nNotice the careless and incompetent workman. If chipping or cutting is\nrequired, he will grasp the first chisel at hand. It may have a curved\nend, or be a key-way chisel, or entirely unsuited as to size for the\ncutting required.\n\nThe result is an injured tool, and unsatisfactory results. The rule\nholds good in this respect as with every other tool in the kit. _Use a\ntool for the purpose it was made for_, and for no other. Acquire that\nhabit.\n\nCOLD CHISELS.--A cold chisel should never be ground to a long, tapering\npoint, like a wood chisel. The proper taper for a wood chisel is 15\ndegrees, whereas a cold chisel should be 45 degrees. A drifting chisel\nmay have a longer taper than one used for chipping.\n\nIt is a good habit, particularly as there are so few tools which require\ngrinding, to commence the day's work by grinding the chisels, and\narranging them for business.\n\nSYSTEM IN WORK.--Then see to it that the drills are in good shape; and\nwhile you are about it, look over the lathe tools. You will find that it\nis better to do this work at one time, than to go to the emery wheel a\ndozen times a day while you are engaged on the job.\n\nAdopt a system in your work. Don't take things just as they come along,\nbut form your plans in an orderly way, and you will always know how to\ntake up and finish the work in the most profitable and satisfactory way.\n\nWRONG USE OF TOOLS.--Never use the vise as an anvil. Ordinary and proper\nuse of this tool will insure it for a lifetime, aside from its natural\nwear. It may be said with safety that a vise will never break if used\nfor the purpose for which it was intended. One blow of a hammer may ruin\nit.\n\nFurthermore, never use an auxiliary lever to screw up the jaws. If the\nlever which comes with it is not large enough to set the jaws, you may\nbe sure that the vise is not large enough for your work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nSETTING AND HOLDING TOOLS\n\n\nSome simple directions in the holding and setting of tools may be of\nservice to the novice. Practice has shown the most effective way of\ntreating different materials, so that the tools will do the most\nefficient work.\n\nA tool ground in a certain way and set at a particular angle might do\nthe work admirably on a piece of steel, but would not possibly work on\naluminum or brass.\n\nLATHE SPEED.--If the lathe should run at the same speed on a piece of\ncast iron as with a brass casting, the result would not be very\nsatisfactory, either with the tool or on the work itself.\n\nSome compositions of metal require a high speed, and some a hooked tool.\nThese are things which each must determine as the articles come to the\nshop; but there are certain well-defined rules with respect to the\nordinary metals that should be observed.\n\nTHE HACK SAW.--Our first observation should be directed to the hand\ntools. The hack saw is one of the most difficult tools for the machinist\nto handle, for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, of the desire to force the blade through the work. The blade is a\nfrail instrument, and when too great a pressure is exerted it bends, and\nas a result a breakage follows. To enable it to do the work properly, it\nmust be made of the hardest steel. It is, in consequence, easily\nfractured.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 28.--Hack Saw Frame._]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 29.--Hack Saw Blade._]\n\nSecond. The novice will make short hacking cuts. This causes the teeth\nto stick, the saw bends, and a new blade is required. Take a long\nsweeping cut, using the entire length of the blade. Do not oscillate the\nblade as you push it through the work, but keep the tooth line\nhorizontal from one end of the stroke to the other. The moment it begins\nto waver, the teeth will catch on the metal on the side nearest to you,\nand it will snap.\n\nThird. The handle is held too loosely. The handle must be firmly held\nwith the right hand, and the other held by the fingers lightly, but in\nsuch a position that a steady downward pressure can be maintained. If\nloosely held, the saw is bound to sag from side to side during the\nstroke, and a short stroke accentuates the lateral movement. A long\nstroke avoids this.\n\nThe hack saw is one of the tools which should be used with the utmost\ndeliberation, combined with a rigid grasp of the handle.\n\nFILES.--For remarks on this tool see Chapter IV, which treats of the\nsubject specially.\n\nGRINDSTONES, EMERY AND GRINDING WHEELS.--A good workman is always\nreflected by his grinding apparatus. This is true whether it has\nreference to a grindstone, emery, corundum wheel, or a plain oil stone.\nNothing is more destructive of good tools than a grooved, uneven, or\nwabbly stone. It is only little less than a crime for a workman to hold\na tool on a revolving stone at one spot.\n\nCARELESSNESS IN HOLDING TOOLS.--The boy must learn that such a habit\nactually prevents the proper grinding, not only of the tool he has on\nthe stone, but also of the one which follows. While it is true that all\nartificially made grinders will wear unevenly, even when used with the\nutmost care, due to uneven texture of the materials in the stone,\nstill, the careless use of the tool, while in the act of grinding, only\naggravates the trouble.\n\nAnother fault of the careless workman is, to press the bit against the\nstone too hard. This cuts the stone more than it wears off the tool, and\nit is entirely unnecessary. Furthermore, it heats up the tool, which\nshould be avoided.\n\nCALIPERS.--A true workman, who endeavors to turn out accurate work, and\npreserve his tools, will never test the work with his calipers while the\npiece is turning in the lathe. A revolving cast iron disk will cut ruby,\nthe hardest substance next to the diamond, so it is not the hardness of\nthe material which resists wear, but the conditions under which it is\nused.\n\nCARE IN USE OF CALIPERS.--The calipers may be of the most hardened\nsteel, and the work turned up of the softest brass, the latter, when\nrevolving, will grind off the point of the tool, for the reason that the\nrevolving piece constantly presents a new surface to the point of the\ncalipers, and when tests are frequently made, it does not take long to\nchange the caliper span so that it must be reset.\n\nAs stated elsewhere, the whole energy of the lathe is concentrated on\nthe bit or cutting tool, hence, in order to get the most effective work\nout of it requires care; first, in grinding; and, second, in setting.\n\nMACHINE BITS.--It does not always matter so much whether you use a\nsquare, pointed, or a round-nosed bit, provided it is properly ground\nand set in the tool holder. As a rule, the more brittle the metal the\nless the top rake or angle should be.\n\nIn the chapter relating to the grinding of tools, references were made\nas to the most serviceable bits for the various metals. We are concerned\nhere with the setting or holding of these articles.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 30. Plain Hook Tool_ _Fig. 31. Plain Straight\nTool._]\n\nThe two illustrations here given show a pair of plain bits, in which\nFig. 30 represents a hook-shaped formation, and Fig. 31 a straight\ngrind, without any top rake. The hooked bit would do for aluminum, or\nsteel, but for cast iron the form shown in Fig. 31 would be most\nserviceable.\n\nThen the side bits, such as the round-nosed, Fig. 32 and the square end,\nFig. 33, may be ground hooked, or with a top rake, or left flat.\n\nThe too common mistake is to grind the lower or clearance side at too\ngreat an angle. Fig. 34 shows the correct angle, and the dotted line A\nillustrates the common tendency to grind the clearance.\n\nTHE PROPER ANGLE FOR LATHE TOOLS.--Now there is a reason why the angle\nof from 10 to 15 should be maintained in the clearance. The point of the\ntool must have suitable support for the work it is required to do, so it\nwill not chatter or yield in the slightest degree. A bit ground along\nthe dotted line has a cutting edge which will spring down, and\nconsequently break or produce a rough surface.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 32. Fig. 33. Fig. 34. Proper Angles for Tools_]\n\nThen, again, the angle of the clearance acts as a guide, or rather, a\nguard, to prevent the tool from going in too far, as will now be\nexplained.\n\nSETTING THE BIT.--In order to understand the correct setting, examine\nthe work A, in Fig. 35.\n\nA is a cylinder being turned up in the lathe, and B the cutting tool,\nwhich approaches it on a horizontal line, C, extending out from the\ncenter of the cylinder A. This setting is theoretically correct, and in\npractice has been found most advantageous.\n\nIn this case let us assume that the clearance angle D is 15 degrees, as\nwell as in the following figures.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 35. Set of the Bit_]\n\nSuppose we have a piece of tough steel, and the tool holder is raised so\nthat the point of the tool is at the 15 degree line E, as shown in Fig.\n36, in which case the clearance line D is at right angles to the line E.\nThe line E is 15 degrees above the center line C.\n\nTHE SETTING ANGLE.--Now, it is obvious that if the tool should be raised\nhigher than the line E it would run out of work, because the clearance\nsurface of the tool would ride up over the surface cut by the edge of\nthe tool.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the tool should be placed lower, toward the line\nC, the tendency would be to draw in the tool toward the center of the\nwork A.\n\nIn Fig. 37 the tool has its point elevated, in which case it must be\nlowered so the point will touch the work nearer the center line C.\n\nThe foregoing arrangement of the tools will be found to be effective\nwhere the material is soft and not too tough as with aluminum.\n\nBAD PRACTICE.--Figs. 38 and 39 show illustrations of bad practice which\nshould never be resorted to. Fig. 38 shows the tool, held in a\nhorizontal position, but with its point below the center line C. With\nany rough metal the tool could not possibly work, except to act as a\nscraper, and if it should be used in that position on cast iron, the\ntool itself would soon be useless.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 36. Correct Angle_ _Fig. 37. Wrong Angle_]\n\nFig. 39 is still worse, and is of no value for any purpose except in\npolishing brass, where it would be serviceable. It would make a sorry\nlooking job with aluminum. Brass requires a tool with very little top\nrake, and the point should be set near the center line C.\n\nLATHE SPEED.--It is often a question at what speeds to run the lathe for\ndifferent work. If you know the speeds of your lathe at low and high\ngear, you must also consider the diameter of the work at the cutting\npoint.\n\nThe rule is to have the bit cut from 15 to 20 feet per minute for\nwrought iron; from 11 to 18 feet for steel; from 25 to 50 for brass; and\nfrom 40 to 50 for aluminum.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 38. Too Low_ _Fig. 39. Improper Set_]\n\nAs a result, therefore, if, at low speed, a piece 10 inches in diameter,\nruns at the proper speed to cut at that distance from the center, it is\nobvious that a piece 5 inches in diameter should ran twice as fast. This\nis a matter which time and practice will enable you to judge with a fair\ndegree of accuracy.\n\nObserve this as a maxim: \"Slow speed, and quick feed.\"\n\nBORING TOOLS ON LATHE.--The lathe is a most useful tool for boring\npurposes, better for some work than the drilling machine itself. The\nwork which can be done better on a lathe than on a drilling machine, may\nbe classified as follows:\n\n1. When straight and true holes are required.\n\n2. In long work, where the lathe is used to turn up the article, and\nwhere the drilling can be done at the same time.\n\n3. Anything that can be chucked in a lathe.\n\n4. Where the work is long and cannot be fixed in a drilling machine. The\nlong bed of the lathe gives room for holding such work.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 40. Internal Set_ _Fig. 41. Set for Brass_]\n\nTHE RAKE OF THE DRILL.--A boring tool requires some knowledge in\nsetting. It should have a greater top rake than for the outside work,\nand the cutting edge should also be keener, as a rule.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 42.--Surface Gage._]\n\nIn this class of work the material bored must be understood, as well as\nin doing outside work.\n\nThe hooked tool, Fig. 40, is shown to be considerably above the center\nline, and at that point it will do the most effective cutting on steel.\nIf, on the other hand, brass is operated on there should be no top\nrake, as illustrated in Fig. 41, thus assuring a smooth job.\n\nLAPS.--This is a tool which is very useful, particularly for grinding\nand truing up the cylinders of internal combustion engines, as well as\nfor all kinds of bores of refractory material which cannot be handled\nwith the cutting tool of the lathe.\n\nIt is made up of a mandrel or rod of copper, with lead cast about it,\nand then turned up true, so that it is but the merest trifle larger than\nthe hole it is to true up.\n\nUSING THE LAP.--The roller thus made is turned rapidly in a lathe, and\nthe cylinder to be trued is brought up to it and the roller supplied\nfreely with emery powder and oil. As rapidly as possible the cylinder is\nworked over on the roller, without forcing it, and also turned, so as to\nprevent even the weight from grinding it unduly on one side.\n\nMore or less of the emery will embed itself in the lead, and thus act as\nan abrasive. The process is called \"lapping.\"\n\nSURFACE GAGES.--Frequently, in laying out, it is necessary to scribe\nlines at a given distance from some part of the work; or, the conditions\nare such that a rule, a caliper, or dividers will not permit accurate\nmeasurement to be made.\n\nFor such purposes, what is called a surface gage was devised. This is\nmerely a heavy base, provided with a pivoted upright on which is\nmounted a scribe that is held by a clamp so it may be turned to any\nangle.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 43.--Showing uses of the Surface Gage._]\n\nSURFACE GAGE.--The clamp holding the scriber is vertically movable on\nthe pivoted upright. By resting the base of the surface gage on the line\nto be measured from, and swinging one point of the scriber to the place\nwhere the work is to be done, accuracy is assured. One end of the\nscriber is bent, so it can be adapted to enter recesses, or such places\nas could not be reached by the straight end.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nON THE USE OF THE FILE\n\n\nThe most necessary tool in a machine shop is a file. It is one of the\nneglected tools, because the ordinary boy, or workman, sees nothing in\nit but a strip or a bar with a lot of cross grooves and edges, and he\nconcludes that the only thing necessary is to rub it across a piece of\nmetal until he has worn it down sufficiently for the purpose.\n\nTHE FIRST TEST.--The fact is, the file is so familiar a tool, that it\nbreeds contempt, like many other things closely associated in life.\n\nGive the boy an irregular block of metal, and tell him to file it up\nsquare, and he will begin to realize that there is something in the\nhandling of a file that never before occurred to him.\n\nHe will find three things to astonish him:\n\nFirst: That of dimensions.\n\nSecond: The difficulty of getting it square.\n\nThird: The character of the surface when he has finished it.\n\nFILING AN IRREGULAR BLOCK.--To file a block of an irregular character so\nthat the dimensions are accurate, is a good test for an accomplished\nworkman. The job is made doubly difficult if he is required to file it\nsquare at the same time. It will be found, invariably, that the sides\nwill not be parallel, and by the time it is fully trued up the piece\nwill be too small. See Figs. 44 and 45.\n\nThen, unless the utmost care is taken, the flat sides _will not_ be\nflat, but rounded.\n\nFILING A BAR STRAIGHT.--The next test is to get the boy to file a bar\nstraight. He has no shaper or planer for the purpose, so that it must be\ndone by hand. He will find himself lacking in two things: The edge of\nthe bar will not be straight; nor will it be square with the side of the\nbar.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 44. Rounded Surface_ _Fig. 45. A Winding Face_]\n\nFILING BAR WITH PARALLEL SIDES.--Follow up this test by requiring him to\nfile up a bar, first, with two exactly parallel sides, and absolutely\nstraight, so it will pass smoothly between the legs of a pair of\ncalipers, and then file the two other sides in like manner.\n\nSURFACING OFF DISKS.--When the foregoing are completed there is still\nanother requirement which, though it appears simple, is the supreme\ntest. Set him to work at surfacing off a pair of disks or plates, say\none and a half inches in diameter, so that when they are finished they\nwill fit against each other perfectly flat.\n\nA pair of such disks, if absolutely true, will hold together by the\nforce of cohesion, even in a dry state, or they will, as it were, float\nagainst each other.\n\nTRUE SURFACING.--Prior to about 1850 the necessity of true surfacing was\nnot so important or as well known as at the present time. About that\nperiod Sir J. Whitworth, an eminent English engineer and mechanic,\ncalled the attention of machinists to the great advantage arising from\ntrue surfaces and edges for all types of machinery, and he laid the\nfoundation of the knowledge in accurating surfacing.\n\nPRECISION TOOLS.--Due to his energy many precision tools were made, all\ntending to this end, and as a result machines became better and more\nefficient in every way.\n\nIt had this great advantage: It taught the workman of his day how to use\nthe file and scraper, because both must be used conjunctively to make an\nabsolutely flat plate.\n\nContrary to general beliefs, shapers and planers do not make absolutely\naccurate surfaces. The test of this is to put together two plates so\nplaned off. There is just enough unevenness to permit air to get between\nthe plates. If they were perfectly true they would exclude all air, and\nit would be a difficult matter to draw them apart.\n\nTEST OF THE MECHANIC.--To make them perfectly flat, one plate has chalk\nrubbed over it, and the two plates are then rubbed together. This will\nquickly show where the high spots are, and the file and scraper are then\nused to cut away the metal.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 46. Fig. 47. Hexagon Nut_]\n\nIn England the test of the mechanic used to be determined by his ability\nto file a piece of metal flat. It was regarded as the highest art. This\nis not the most desirable test at the present time, and it is recognized\nthat a much severer test is to file a narrow piece exactly flat, and so\nthat it will not have a trace of roundness, and be square from end to\nend.\n\nTEST SUGGESTIONS.--In a shop which does not have the advantage of a\nplaner or shaper, there are so many articles which must be filed up,\nthat it is interesting to know something of how the various articles are\nmade with a file.\n\nTo file a hexagon, or six-sided nut will be a good test with a file. To\ndo this a little study in geometrical lines will save a vast amount of\ntime. In beginning the work, measure the radius with a divider, and then\nstep off and make six marks equidistant from each other on the round\nsurface.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 48. Cutting Key-way_]\n\nUSE OF THE DIVIDERS.--The distance between each of these points is equal\nto the radius, or half the diameter, of the round bar. See Fig. 46,\nwhich shows this. The marks should be scribed across the surface, as\nshown in Fig. 47, where the lines show the ends of the facets of the\noutside of the nut.\n\nDo not let the file obliterate the lines at the rough cutting, but\nleave enough material so you can make a good finish at the line.\n\nCUTTING A KEY-WAY.--Another job you may have frequent occasion to\nperform, is to cut a way for a key in a shaft and in a wheel hub.\nNaturally, this will be first roughed out with a cold chisel narrower\nthan the key is to be, and also slightly shallower than the dimensions\nof the key.\n\nA flat file should be used for the purpose, first a heavy rough one, for\nthe first cutting. The better way is to have the key so it can be\nfrequently tried while the filing process is going on, so that to fit\nthe key in this way is a comparatively easy task.\n\nKEY-WAY DIFFICULTIES.--But the trouble commences when the groove is\nfiled for the depth. Invariably, the mistake will be made of filing the\nwidth first, so the key will fit in. As a result, in deepening the\ngroove the file will contact with the walls, and you have a key-way too\nwide for the key.\n\nTo avoid this, file the depth, or nearly so, and then with a fine file\ncut in the corners in the direction indicated by the dart, Fig. 48.\n\nA proper key is square in cross section. In such a case the depth of the\nkey-way, at each side wall, is just half the width of the key-way.\n\nAn excellent key-seat rule can be made by filing out two right-angled\npieces, as shown in Fig. 49, which can be attached to the ordinary\nsix-inch metal rule, and this will enable you to scribe the line\naccurately for the key-way on the shaft.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 49. Key-seat Rule_]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 50. Fig. 51. Filing Metal Round_]\n\nFILING METAL ROUND.--It is sometimes necessary to file a piece of metal\nround. This is a hard job, particularly where it is impossible to scribe\nthe end of the piece. Suppose it is necessary to file up a bearing\nsurface, or surfaces, intermediate the ends of a square bar.\n\nYou have in that case four sides to start from, the opposite sides\nbeing parallel with each other, so that you will have two dimensions,\nand four equal sides, as shown in Fig. 50.\n\nThe first step will be to file off accurately the four corners 1, 2, 3,\n4, so as to form eight equal sides or faces, as shown in Fig. 51. If you\nwill now proceed to file down carefully the eight corners, so as to make\nsixteen sides, as in Fig. 52, the fourth set of corners filed down will\nmake the filed part look like the illustration Fig. 53 with thirty-two\nfaces.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 52. Fig. 53. Making a Bar Round_]\n\nThis may be further filed down into sixty-four faces, and a few cuts of\nthe finishing file will take off the little ridges which still remain.\nBy using emery cloth, and wrapping it around the bearing portion, and\nchanging it continually, while drawing it back and forth, will enable\nyou to make a bearing which, by care, will caliper up in good shape.\n\nKINDS OF FILES.--Each file has five distinct properties; namely: the\nlength, the contour, the form in cross section, the kind of teeth, and\nthe fineness of the teeth.\n\nThere are nine well-defined shapes for files. These may be enumerated as\nfollows:\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 54. Cross Sections of Files._]\n\nNo. 1. The cotter file. The small kind is called a verge or pivot file.\n\nNo. 2. Square file, which may be tapering from end to end, or have\nparallel sides throughout.\n\nNo. 3. Watch pinion file. This may have its sides parallel or tapering,\nto make a knife-shaped file.\n\nNo. 4. Clock-pinion; which may be used for either nicking, piecing, or\nsquaring-off purposes.\n\nNo. 5. Round, with parallel sides for gulleting purposes, or rat-tail\nwhen it tapers.\n\nNo. 6. Triangular, or three equally-sided body for saw filing.\n\nNo. 7. Equalizing file. This is parallel when used for making\nclock-pinions or endless screws; or for slitting, entering, warding, or\nmaking barrel holes, when the body of the file tapers.\n\nNo. 8. Cross, or double-round, half-file.\n\nNo. 9. Slitting file; which has parallel sides only. A cant file.\n\nCHARACTER OF THE FILE TOOTH.--Files are distinguished principally by the\ncharacter of the oblique, or cross grooves and ridges which do the\ncutting and abrading when the file is drawn across the surface.\n\nThis is really more important than the shape, because the files, by\ntheir cuttings, are adapted for the various materials which they are to\nbe used upon.\n\nThe files are classified as _Double Cut_, of which there are the\n_rough_, _middle_, _bastard_, _second cut_, _smooth_, and _dead smooth_.\n\nThe _Float Cut_, which is either _rough_, _bastard_ or _smooth_; and\n\nThe _Rasp Cut_, either _rough_, _bastard_ or _smooth_.\n\nSeveral types are illustrated in Fig. 55, which show the characteristics\nof the various cuts.\n\nThe rasps are used principally for soft material, such as wood or for\nhoofs, in horse shoeing, hence they need not be considered in connection\nwith machine-shop work.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 55. Files._]\n\nHOLDING THE FILE.--The common mistake on the part of the beginner is to\ndrag the file across the work at an angle. The body of the file should\nmove across straight and not obliquely.\n\nNote this movement in Fig. 56 where the dash shows the correct movement\nof the file with relation to the work. Also observe that the file\ncutting ridges are not straight across the file, but at an angle to the\ndirection of the dart.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 56. Correct File Movement_]\n\nINJURING FILES.--Now the frequent practice is to use the file as shown\nin Fig. 57, in which case it is moved across obliquely. The result is\nthat the angle of the file cut is so disposed that the teeth of the file\ndo not properly aid in the cutting, but in a measure retard the\noperation.\n\nFile teeth are disposed at an angle for the purpose of giving them a\nshearing cut, which is the case when the file moves across the work on a\nline with its body.\n\nTo use a file as shown in Fig. 57 injures the file without giving it an\nopportunity to cut as fast as it would when properly used.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 57. Incorrect File Movement_]\n\nDRAWING BACK THE FILE.--In drawing back a file it is always better to\nallow it to drag over the work than to raise it up. It is frequently the\ncase that some of the material will lodge in the teeth, and the back\nlash will serve to clear out the grooves.\n\nThis is particularly true in filing copper, aluminum, lead, and like\nmetals, but it is well to observe this in all cases.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nHOW TO COMMENCE WORK\n\n\nThe question is often asked: Where and how shall the novice commence\nwork?\n\nWhen the shop is equipped, or partially so, sufficient, at least, to\nturn out simple jobs, the boy will find certain tools which are\nstrangers to him. He must become acquainted with them and not only learn\ntheir uses, but how to use them to the best advantage.\n\nFAMILIARITY WITH TOOLS.--Familiarity with the appearance of tools, and\nseeing them in the hands of others will not be of any value. Nothing but\nthe immediate contact with the tool will teach how to use it.\n\nFILE PRACTICE.--The file is a good tool to pick up first. Select a piece\nof metal, six or eight inches long, and follow the instructions laid\ndown in the chapter relating to the use of the file.\n\nPractice with several kinds and with different varieties of material\nwill soon give an inkling of the best kind to use with the metal you\nhave. Use the straight edge and the square while the filing process is\ngoing on, and apply them frequently, to show you what speed you are\nmaking and how nearly true you are surfacing up the piece.\n\nUSING THE DIVIDERS.--Then try your hand using the dividers, in\nconnection with a centering punch. As an example, take two pieces of\nmetal, each about a foot long, and set the dividers to make a short\nspan, say an inch or so, and step off the length of one piece of metal,\nand punch the last mark. Then do likewise with the other piece of metal,\nand see how nearly alike the two measurements are by comparing them.\n\nYou will find a variation in the lengths of the two measurements at the\nfirst trials, and very likely will not be able to make the two pieces\nregister accurately after many trials, even when using the utmost care.\n\nSooner or later you will learn that you have not stepped paths along the\ntwo bars which were exactly straight, and this will account for the\nvariations. In order to be accurate a line should be drawn along each\npiece of metal, and the dividers should step off the marks on that line.\n\nFINDING CENTERS.--By way of further experiment, it might be well to find\nthe exact center of the ends of a square bar, putting in the punch marks\nand then mounting it in the lathe centers to see how accurately this has\nbeen done.\n\nIf either end is out of true the punch marks can be corrected by\ninclining the punch, so that when it is struck it will move over the\npoint in the direction of its true center. This may be followed up by\ncentering the end of a round bar so as to make it true. This will be\nfound to be a more difficult job, unless you have a center head, a tool\nmade for that purpose.\n\nIt is good practice, however, to make trials of all this work, as it\nwill enable you to judge of measurements. It can be done with the\ndividers by using care in scribing the centers.\n\nHACK-SAW PRACTICE.--Practice with the hack-saw should be indulged in\nfrequently. Learn to make a straight cut through a bar. Try to do this\nwithout using a square to guide you. One of the tests of a good mechanic\nis ability to judge a straight cut.\n\nThe following plan is suggested as a test for the eye. Use a bar of iron\nor steel one inch square, and make a cut an eighth of an inch deep\nacross it; then turn it around a quarter, so as to expose the nest face,\nand continue the cut along the side, the same depth, and follow this up\nwith the remaining two sides, and see how near the end of the first cut\nand the finish cut come together. The test will surprise you.\n\nCUTTING METALS TRUE.--When you saw off the end of such a bar for trial\npurposes, use a square, after the cut is made, and note how much it is\nout of true in both directions. It is a curious fact that most mechanics\nare disposed to saw or cut crooked in one direction, either to the right\nor to the left. In tests made it is found that this defect is persisted\nin.\n\nIt is practice only which will remedy this, and it would be well for the\nboy to learn this for himself as early in his career as possible, and\ncorrect the tendency to veer in either direction.\n\nThe test of sawing around a round bar is also commended. After a few\ntrials you will be surprised to see how your judgment will improve in\npractice.\n\nLATHE WORK.--Learn the uses of the chuck. As you have, probably,\neconomized as much as possible, a universal chuck is not available,\nhence the first experience will be with an independent chuck, where the\nthree dogs move independently of each other. This will give you some\nwork to learn how you can get the job true.\n\nNow, before attempting to cut the material, thoroughly learn all the\nparts of the feed mechanism, and how to reverse, as well as to cross\nfeed. Learn the operation of the operative parts so that your hand will\ninstinctively find them, while the eye is on the work.\n\nFIRST STEPS.--See to it that your tools are sharp, and at the first\ntrials make light cuts. Practice the feeds by manually moving the tool\nholder, for surface cutting as well as for cross cutting.\n\nSETTING THE TOOL.--Set the cutting tool at various angles, and try the\ndifferent tools, noting the peculiarities of each, at the different\nspeeds. Do not, by any means, use refractory metals for your first\nattempt. Mild steel is a good test, and a light gray iron is admirable\nfor practice lessons.\n\nMETALS USED.--Brass is good for testing purposes, but the difficulty is\nthat the tendency of the boy, at first, is to try to do the work too\nrapidly, and brass encourages this tendency. Feed slowly and regularly\nuntil you can make an even finish.\n\nThen chuck and re-chuck to familiarize yourself with every operative\npart of the lathe, and never try to force the cutting tool. If it has a\ntendency to run into the work, set it higher. If, on the other hand, you\nfind, in feeding, that it is hard to move the tool post along, the tool\nis too high, and should be lowered.\n\nTHE FOUR IMPORTANT THINGS.--Constant practice of this kind will soon\nenable you to feel instinctively when the tool is doing good work. While\nyou are thus experimenting do not forget the speed. This will need your\nattention.\n\nRemember, you have several things to think about in commencing to run\nthe lathe, all of which will take care of themselves when it becomes\nfamiliar to you. These may be enumerated as follows:\n\nFirst: The kind of tool best to use.\n\nSecond: Its proper set, to do the best work.\n\nThird: The speed of the work in the lathe.\n\nFourth: The feed, or the thickness of the cut into the material.\n\nTURNING UP A CYLINDER.--The first and most important work is to turn up\na small cylinder to a calipered dimension. When it is roughed down ready\nfor the finish cut, set the tool so it will take off a sufficient amount\nto prevent the caliper from spanning it, and this will enable you to\nfinish it off with emery paper, or allow another small cut to be taken.\n\nTURNING GROOVES.--Then follow this up by turning in a variety of annular\ngrooves of different depths and widths; and also V-shaped grooves, the\nlatter to be performed by using both the longitudinal and transverse\nfeeds. This will give you excellent practice in using both hands\nsimultaneously.\n\nThe next step would be to turn out a bore and fit a mandrel into it.\nThis will give you the opportunity to use the caliper to good advantage,\nand will test your capacity to use them for inside as well as for\noutside work.\n\nDISCS.--A job that will also afford good exercise is to turn up a disc\nwith a groove in its face, and then chuck and turn another disk with an\nannular rib on its face to fit into the groove. This requires delicacy\nof measurement with the inside as well as the outside calipers.\n\nThe groove should be cut first, and the measurement taken from that, as\nit is less difficult to handle and set the tool for the rib than for the\ngroove.\n\nLATHE SPEEDS.--Do not make the too common mistake of running the mandrel\nat high speeds in your initial tests. It is far better to use a slow\nspeed, and take a heavy cut. This is good advice at all times, but it is\nparticularly important with beginners.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nILLUSTRATING SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DEVICES\n\n\nThere are numerous little devices and shop expedients which are\ndesirable, and for which the boy will find uses as he progresses.\n\nWe devote this chapter to hints of this kind, all of which are capable\nof being turned out or utilized at various stages.\n\nLACING BELTS.--To properly lace a belt is quite an art, as many who have\ntried it know. If a belt runs off the pulley it is attributable to one\nof three causes: either the pulleys are out of line or the shafts are\nnot parallel or the belt is laced so it makes the belt longer at one\nmargin than the other.\n\nIn Fig. 58 the lacing should commence at the center hole (A) of one belt\nend and lace outwardly, terminating at the hole (B) in the center of the\nother belt end, as shown in Fig. 58.\n\nIn Fig. 59 the lacing commences at A, and terminates at the hole (B) at\nthe edge. This will be ample for all but the widest belts.\n\nFig. 60 is adapted for a narrow belt. The lacing commences at one margin\nhole (A), and terminates at the other margin hole (Z).\n\nFig. 61 shows the outside of the belt.\n\nFig. 62. GEARS.--This is something every boy ought to know about. Fig.\n62 shows a pair of intermeshing bevel gears. This is the correct term\nfor a pair when both are of the same diameter.\n\n[Illustration: _Inside Fig. 58. Belt Lacing_\n _Outside Fig. 58. Belt Lacing_\n _Fig. 59. Belt Lacing_\n _Fig. 60. Belt Lacing_\n _Fig. 61. Belt Lacing_]\n\nMITER GEARS.--In Fig. 63 we have a pair of miter gears, one being larger\nthan the other. Remember this distinction.\n\nFig. 64. CROWN WHEEL.--This is a simple manner of transmitting motion\nfrom one shaft to another, when the shafts are at right angles, or\nnearly so, without using bevel or miter gears.\n\nFig. 65. GROOVED FRICTION GEARING.--Two grooved pulleys, which fit each\nother accurately, will transmit power without losing too much by\nfriction. The deeper the grooves the greater is the loss by friction.\n\nFig. 66. A VALVE WHICH CLOSES BY THE WATER PRESSURE.--The bibb has\ntherein a movable valve on a horizontal stem, the valve being on the\ninside of the seat. The stem of the handle has at its lower end a crank\nbend, which engages with the outer end of the valve stem. When the\nhandle is turned in either direction the valve is unseated. On releasing\nthe handle the pressure of the water against the valve seats it.\n\nFig. 67. CONE PULLEYS.--Two cone pulleys of equal size and taper provide\na means whereby a change in speed can be transmitted from one shaft to\nanother by merely moving the belt to and fro. The slightest change is\navailable by this means.\n\nFig. 68. UNIVERSAL JOINT.--A wheel, with four projecting pins, is placed\nbetween the U-shaped yokes on the ends of the approaching shafts. The\npins serve as the pivots for the angles formed by the two shafts.\n\nFig. 69. TRAMMEL FOR MAKING AN ELLIPSE.--This is a tool easily made,\nwhich will be of great service in the shop. In a disc (A), preferably\nmade of brass, are two channels (B) at right angles to each other. The\ngrooves are undercut, so that the blocks (C) will fit and slide in the\ngrooves and be held therein by the dove-tailed formation. Each block is\nlonger than the width of the groove, and has an outwardly projecting pin\nwhich passes through a bar (D). One pin (E) is movable along in a slot,\nbut is adjustable at any point so that the shape of the ellipse may be\nvaried. The end of the bar has a series of holes (G) for a pencil, so\nthat the size of the ellipse may also be changed.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 62. Bevel Gears_\n _Fig. 63. Miter Gears_\n _Fig. 64. Crown Wheel_\n _Fig. 65. Grooved Friction Gears_\n _Fig. 66. Valve_\n _Fig. 67. Cone Pulleys_\n _Fig. 68. Universal Joint_]\n\nFig. 70. ESCAPEMENTS.--Various forms of escapements may be made, but the\nobject of all is the same. The device is designed to permit a wheel to\nmove intermittingly or in a step by step movement, by the swinging\nmotion of a pendulum. Another thing is accomplished by it. The teeth of\nthe escapement are cut at such an angle that, as one of the teeth of the\nescapement is released from one tooth of the escapement wheel, the\nspring, or the weight of the clock, will cause one of the teeth of the\nescapement wheel to engage the other tooth of the escapement, and give\nthe pendulum an impulse in the other direction. In the figure, A is the\nescapement, B the escapement wheels and _a_, _b_, the pallets, which\nare cut at suitable angles to actuate the pendulum.\n\nFig. 71. SIMPLE DEVICE TO PREVENT A WHEEL OR SHAFT FROM TURNING\nBACK.--This is a substitute for a pawl and ratchet wheel. A is a drum or\na hollow wheel and B a pulley on a shaft, and this pulley turns loosely\nwith the drum (A). Four tangential slots (C) are cut into the perimeter\nof the pulley (B), and in each is a hardened steel roller (D). It\nmatters not in what position the wheel (B) may be, at least two of the\nrollers will always be in contact with the inside of the drum (A), and\nthus cause the pulley and drum to turn together. On reversing the\ndirection of the pulley the rollers are immediately freed from binding\ncontact.\n\nFig. 72. RACKS AND PINIONS.--The object of this form of mechanism is to\nprovide a reciprocating, or back-and-forth motion, from a shaft which\nturns continually in one direction. A is the rack and B a mutilated\ngear. When the gear turns it moves the rack in one direction, because\nthe teeth of the gear engage the lower rack teeth, and when the rack has\nmoved to the end its teeth engage the teeth of the upper rack, thus\nreversing the movement of the rack.\n\nFig. 73. MUTILATED GEARS.--These are made in so many forms, and adapted\nfor such a variety of purposes, that we merely give a few samples to\nshow what is meant by the term.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 69. Trammel_\n _Fig. 70. Escapement_\n _Fig. 71. Device for Holding Wheel_\n _Fig. 72. Rack and Pinion_\n _Fig. 73. Mutilated Gears_\n _Fig. 74. Shaft Coupling_]\n\nFig. 74. SIMPLE SHAFT COUPLING.--Prepare two similarly formed discs (A,\nB), which are provided with hubs so they may be keyed to the ends of the\nrespective shafts. One disc has four or more projecting pins (C), and\nthe other disc suitable holes (D) to receive the pins.\n\nFig. 75. CLUTCHES.--This is a piece of mechanism which is required in so\nmany kinds of machinery, that we show several of the most approved\ntypes.\n\nFig. 76. BALL AND SOCKET JOINTS.--The most practical form of ball and\nsocket joints is simply a head in which is a bowl-shaped cavity the\ndepth of one-half of the ball. A plate with a central opening small\nenough to hold in the ball, and still large enough at the neck to\npermit the arm carrying the ball to swing a limited distance, is secured\nby threads, or by bolts, to the head. The first figure shows this.\n\nFig. 77 illustrates a simple manner of tightening the ball so as to hold\nthe standard in any desired position.\n\nFig. 78. TRIPPING DEVICES.--These are usually in the form of hooks, so\narranged that a slight pull on the tripping lever will cause the\nsuspended articles to drop.\n\nFig. 79. ANCHOR BOLT.--These are used in brick or cement walls. The bolt\nitself screws into a sleeve which is split, and draws a wedge nut up to\nthe split end of the sleeve. As a result the split sleeve opens or\nspreads out and binds against the wall sufficiently to prevent the bolt\nfrom being withdrawn.\n\nFig. 80. LAZY TONGS.--One of the simplest and most effective instruments\nfor carrying ice, boxes or heavy objects, which are bulky or\ninconvenient to carry. It grasps the article firmly, and the heavier the\nweight the tighter is its grasp.\n\nFig. 81. DISC SHEARS.--This is a useful tool either for cutting tin or\npaper, pasteboard and the like. It will cut by the act of drawing the\nmaterial through it, but if power is applied to one or to both of the\nshafts the work is much facilitated, particularly in thick or hard\nmaterial.\n\n[Illustration:\n _Fig. 75. Clutches_\n _Fig. 76. Ball and Socket Joints_\n _Fig. 77. Fastening Ball_\n _Fig. 78. Tripping Devices_\n _Fig. 79. Anchor Bolt_\n _Fig. 80. Lazy Tongs._\n _Fig. 81. Disc Shears._]\n\nFig. 82. WABBLE SAW.--This is a most simple and useful tool, as it will\nreadily and quickly saw out a groove so that it is undercut. The saw is\nput on the mandrel at an angle, as will be seen, and should be run at a\nhigh rate of speed.\n\nFig. 83. CRANK MOTION BY A SLOTTED YOKE.--This produces a straight\nback-and-forth movement from the circular motion of a wheel or crank. It\nentirely dispenses with a pitman rod, and it enables the machine, or the\npart of the machine operated, to be placed close to the crank.\n\nFig. 84. CONTINUOUS FEED BY THE MOTION OF A LEVER.--The simple lever\nwith a pawl on each side of the fulcrum is the most effective means to\nmake a continuous feed by the simple movement of a lever. The form shown\nis capable of many modifications, and it can be easily adapted for any\nparticular work desired.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 82. Wabble Saw_\n _Fig. 83. Continuous Crank Motion_\n _Fig. 84. Continuous Feed_\n _Fig. 85. Crank Motion_\n _Fig. 86. Ratchet Head_\n _Fig. 87. Bench Clamp_]\n\nFig. 85. CRANK MOTION.--By the structure shown, namely, a slotted lever\n(A), a quick return can be made with the lever. B indicates the fulcrum.\n\nFig. 86. RATCHET HEAD.--This shows a well-known form for common ratchet.\nIt has the advantage that the radially movable plugs (A) are\ntangentially disposed, and rest against walls (B) eccentrically\ndisposed, and are, therefore, in such a position that they easily slide\nover the inclines.\n\nFig. 87. BENCH CLAMP.--A pair of dogs (A, B), with the ends bent toward\neach other, and pivoted midway between the ends to the bench in such a\nposition that the board (C), to be held between them, on striking the\nrear ends of the dogs, will force the forward ends together, and thus\nclamp it firmly for planing or other purposes.\n\n[Illustration:\n _Fig. 88.

Eccentric Rod and Strap_\n _Fig. 94. Anti-Dead Center for Foot-Lathes_]\n\nFig. 88. HELICO-VOLUTE SPRING.--This is a form of spring for tension\npurposes. The enlarged cross-section of the coil in its middle portion,\nwith the ends tapering down to the eyes, provides a means whereby the\npull is transferred from the smaller to the larger portions, without\nproducing a great breaking strain near the ends.\n\nFig. 89. DOUBLE HELICO-VOLUTE.--This form, so far as the outlines are\nconsidered, is the opposite of Fig. 88. A compression spring of this\nkind has a very wide range of movement.\n\nFig. 90. HELICAL SPRING.--This form of coil, uniform from end to end, is\nusually made of metal which is square in cross-section, and used where\nit is required for heavy purposes.\n\nFig. 91. SINGLE VOLUTE HELIX-SPRING.--This is also used for compression,\nintended where tremendous weights or resistances are to be overcome, and\nwhen the range of movement is small.\n\nFig. 92. FLAT SPIRAL, OR CONVOLUTE.--This is for small machines. It is\nthe familiar form used in watches owing to its delicate structure, and\nit is admirably adapted to yield to the rocking motion of an arbor.\n\nFig. 93. ECCENTRIC ROD AND STRAP.--A simple and convenient form of\nstructure, intended to furnish a reciprocating motion where a crank is\nnot available. An illustration of its use is shown on certain types of\nsteam engine to operate the valves.\n\nFig. 94. ANTI-DEAD CENTER FOR FOOT-LATHES.--A flat, spiral spring (A),\nwith its coiled end attached to firm support (B), has its other end\npivotally attached to the crank-pin (C), the tension of the spring being\nsuch that when the lathe stops the crack-pin will always be at one side\nof the dead-center, thus enabling the operator to start the machine by\nmerely pressing the foot downwardly on the treadle (D).\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nPROPERTIES OF MATERIALS\n\n\nA workman is able to select the right metals because he knows that each\nhas some peculiar property which is best adapted for his particular use.\nThese with their meaning will now be explained.\n\nELASTICITY.--This exists in metals in three distinct ways: First, in the\nform of _traction_. Hang a weight on a wire and it will stretch a\ncertain amount. When the weight is removed the wire shrinks back to its\noriginal length.\n\nSecond: If the weight on the wire is rotated, so as to twist it, and the\nhand is taken from the weight, it will untwist itself, and go back to\nits original position. This is called _torsion_.\n\nThird: A piece of metal may be coiled up like a watch spring, or bent\nlike a carriage spring, and it will yield when pressure is applied. This\nis called _flexure_.\n\nCertain kinds of steel have these qualities in a high degree.\n\nTENACITY.--This is a term used to express the resistance which the body\nopposes to the separation of its parts. It is determined by forming the\nmetal into a wire, and hanging on weights, to find how much will be\nrequired to break it. If we have two wires, the first with a transverse\narea only one-quarter that of the second, and the first breaks at 25\npounds, while the second breaks at 50 pounds, the tenacity of the first\nis twice as great as that of the second.\n\nTo the boy who understands simple ratio in mathematics, the problem\nwould be like this:\n\n25 \u00d7 4 : 50 \u00d7 1, or as 2 : 1.\n\nTHE MOST TENACIOUS METAL.--Steel has the greatest tenacity of all\nmetals, and lead the least. In proportion to weight, however, there are\nmany substances which have this property in a higher degree. Cotton\nfibers will support millions of times their own weight.\n\nThere is one peculiar thing, that tenacity varies with the form of the\nbody. A solid cylindrical body has a greater strength than a square one\nof the same size; and a hollow cylinder more tenacity than a solid one.\nThis principle is well known in the bones of animals, in the feathers of\nbirds, and in the stems of many plants.\n\nIn almost every metal tenacity diminishes as the temperature increases.\n\nDUCTILITY.--This is a property whereby a metal may be drawn out to form\na wire. Some metals, like cast iron, have absolutely no ductility. The\nmetal which possesses this property to the highest degree, is platinum.\nWires of this metal have been drawn out so fine that over 30,000 of them\nlaid side by side would measure only one inch across, and a mile of such\nwire would weigh only a grain, or one seven-thousandth of a pound.\n\nMALLEABILITY.--This is considered a modification of ductility. Any\nmetal which can be beaten out, as with a hammer, or flattened into\nsheets with rollers, is considered malleable. Gold possesses this\nproperty to the highest degree. It has been beaten into leaves one\nthree-hundred-thousandth of an inch thick.\n\nHARDNESS.--This is the resistance which bodies offer to being scratched\nby others. As an example, the diamond has the capacity to scratch all,\nbut cannot be scratched by any other.\n\nALLOYS.--Alloys, that is a combination of two or more metals, are harder\nthan the pure metals, and for this reason jewelry, and coins, are\nusually alloyed.\n\nThe resistance of a body to compression does not depend upon its\nhardness. Strike a diamond with a hammer and it flies to pieces, but\nwood does not. One is brittle and the other is tough.\n\nThe machinist can utilize this property by understanding that velocity\nenables a soft material to cut a harder one. Thus, a wrought iron disc\nrotating rapidly, will cut such hard substances as agate or quartz.\n\nRESISTANCE.--All metals offer more or less resistance to the flow of an\nelectric current. Silver offers the least resistance, and German silver\nthe greatest. Temperature also affects the flow. It passes more easily\nover a cold than a warm conductor.\n\nPERSISTENCE.--All metals on receiving heat, will retain it for a certain\nlength of time, and will finally cool down to the temperature of the\nsurrounding atmosphere. Some, like aluminum, retain it for a long time;\nothers, as iron, will give it off quickly.\n\nCONDUCTIVITY.--All metals will conduct heat and cold, as well as\nelectricity. If one end of a metal bar is heated, the heat creeps along\nto the other end until it has the same temperature throughout. This is\ncalled _equalization_.\n\nIf a heated bar is placed in contact with another, the effect is to\nincrease the temperature of the cold bar and lower that of the warm bar.\nThis is called _reciprocity_.\n\nMOLECULAR FORCES.--_Molecular_ attraction is a force which acts in such\na way as to bring all the particles of a body together. It acts in\nthree ways, dependent on the particular conditions which exist.\n\nFirst: _Cohesion_. This exists between molecules which are of the same\nkind, as for instance, iron. Cohesion of the particles is very strong in\nsolids, much weaker in liquids, and scarcely exists at all between the\nparticles in gases.\n\nSecond: _Adhesion_ is that property which exists between the surfaces of\nbodies in contact. If two flat surfaces are pressed together, as for\ninstance, two perfectly smooth and flat pieces of lead, they will\nadhere. If, for instance, oil should be put on the surfaces, before\nputting them together, they would adhere so firmly that it would be\ndifficult to pull them apart.\n\nThird: _Affinity_. This is another peculiarity about materials. Thus,\nwhile cohesion binds together the molecules of water, it is chemical\naffinity which unites two elements, like hydrogen and oxygen, of which\nwater is composed.\n\nPOROSITY.--All matter has little hollows or spaces between the\nmolecules. You know what this is in the case of a sponge, or pumice\nstone. Certain metals have the pores so small that it is difficult to\nsee them except with a very powerful glass. Under great pressure water\ncan be forced through the pores of metals, as has been done in the case\nof gold. Water also is porous, but the spaces between the molecules are\nvery small.\n\nCOMPRESSIBILITY.--It follows from the foregoing statement, that if there\nare little interstices between the molecules, the various bodies can be\ncompressed together. This can be done in varying degrees with all\nsolids, but liquids, generally, have little compressibility. Gases are\nreadily reduced in volume by compression.\n\nELASTICITY.--This is a property by virtue of which a body resumes its\noriginal form when compressed. India rubber, ivory and glass are\nexamples of elasticity; whereas, lead and clay do not possess this\nproperty. Air is the most elastic of all substances.\n\nINERTIA.--This is a property of matter by virtue of which it cannot of\nitself change its state of motion or of rest.\n\nNewton's first law of motion is, in substance, that matter at rest will\neternally remain at rest, and matter in motion will forever continue in\nmotion, unless acted on by some external force.\n\nA rider is carried over the head of a horse when the latter suddenly\nstops. This illustrates the inertia of movement. A stone at rest will\nalways remain in that condition unless moved by some force. That shows\nthe inertia of rest.\n\nMOMENTUM.--This is the term to designate the quantity of motion in a\nbody. This quantity varies and is dependent on the mass, together with\nthe velocity. A fly wheel is a good example. It continues to move after\nthe impelling force ceases; and a metal wheel has greater momentum than\na wooden wheel at the same speed, owing to its greater mass.\n\nIf, however, the wooden wheel is speeded up sufficiently it may have the\nsame momentum as the metal one.\n\nWEIGHT.--All substances have what is called _weight_. This means that\neverything is attracted toward the earth by the force of gravity.\nGravity, however, is different from weight. All substances attract each\nother; not only in the direction of the center of the earth, but\nlaterally, as well.\n\nWeight, therefore, has reference to the pull of an object toward the\nearth; and gravity to that influence which all matter has for each other\nindependently of the direction.\n\nCENTRIPETAL FORCE.--This attraction of the earth, which gives articles\nthe property of weight, is termed centripetal force--that is, the\ndrawing in of a body.\n\nCENTRIFUGAL FORCE.--The direct opposite of centripetal, is centrifugal\nforce, which tends to throw outwardly. Dirt flying from a rapidly\nmoving wheel illustrates this.\n\nCAPILLARY ATTRACTION.--There is a peculiar property in liquids, which\ndeserves attention, and should be understood, and that is the name given\nto the tendency of liquids to rise in fine tubes.\n\nIt is stated that water will always find its level. While this is true,\nwe have an instance where, owing to the presence of a solid, made in a\npeculiar form, causes the liquid, within, to rise up far beyond the\nlevel of the water.\n\nThis may be illustrated by three tubes of different internal diameters.\nThe liquid rises up higher in the second than in the first, and still\nhigher in the third than in the second. The smaller the tube the greater\nthe height of the liquid.\n\nThis is called _capillary attraction_, the word capillary meaning a\nhair. The phenomena is best observed when seen in tubes which are as\nfine as hairs. The liquid has an affinity for the metal, and creeps up\nthe inside, and the distance it will thus move depends on the size of\nthe tube.\n\nTHE SAP OF TREES.--The sap of trees goes upwardly, not because the tree\nis alive, but due to this property in the contact of liquids with a\nsolid. It is exactly on the same principle that if the end of a piece of\nblotting paper is immersed in water, the latter will creep up and\nspread over the entire surface of the sheet.\n\nIn like manner, oil moves upwardly in a wick, and will keep on doing so,\nuntil the lighted wick is extinguished, when the flow ceases. When it is\nagain lighted the oil again flows, as before.\n\nIf it were not for this principle of capillary attraction, it would be\ndifficult to form a bubble of air in a spirit level. You can readily see\nhow the liquid at each end of the air bubble rounds it off, as though it\ntried to surround it.\n\nSOUND.--Sound is caused by vibration, and it would be impossible to\nconvey it without an elastic medium of some kind.\n\n_Acoustics_ is a branch of physics which treats of sounds. It is\ndistinguished from music which has reference to the particular kinds.\n\n_Sounds_ are distinguished from _noises_. The latter are discordant and\nabrupt vibrations, whereas the former are regular and continuous.\n\nSOUND MEDIUMS.--Gases, vapors, liquids and solids transmit vibrations,\nbut liquids and solids propagate with greater velocity than gases.\n\nVIBRATION.--A vibration is the moving to and fro of the molecules in a\nbody, and the greater their movement the more intense is the sound. The\nintensity of the sound is affected by the density of the atmosphere, and\nthe movement of the winds also changes its power of transmission.\n\nSound is also made more intense if a sonorous body is near its source.\nThis is taken advantage of in musical instruments, where a\nsounding-board is used, as in the case of the piano, and in the violin,\nwhich has a thin shell as a body for holding the strings.\n\nAnother curious thing is shown in the speaking tube, where the sound\nwaves are confined, so that they are carried along in one line, and as\nthey are not interfered with will transmit the vibrations to great\ndistances.\n\nVELOCITY OF SOUND.--The temperature of the air has also an effect on the\nrate of transmission, but for general purposes a temperature of 62\ndegrees has been taken as the standard. The movement is shown to be\nabout 50 miles in 4 minutes, or at the rate of 1,120 feet per second.\n\nIn water, however, the speed is four times greater; and in iron nearly\nfifteen times greater. Soft earth is a poor conductor, while rock and\nsolid earth convey very readily. Placing the ear on a railway track will\ngive the vibrations of a moving train miles before it can be heard\nthrough the air.\n\nSOUND REFLECTIONS.--Sound waves move outwardly from the object in the\nform of wave-like rings, but those concentric rings, as they are\ncalled, may be interrupted at various points by obstacles. When that is\nthe case the sound is buffeted back, producing what is called echoes.\n\nRESONANCE.--Materials have a quality that produces a very useful result,\ncalled _resonance_, and it is one of the things that gives added effect\nto a speaker's voice in a hall, where there is a constant succession of\nechoes. A wall distant from the speaker about 55 feet, produces an\nalmost instantaneous reflection of the sound, and at double that\nmeasurement the effect is still stronger. When the distance is too short\nfor the reflecting sound to be heard, we have _resonance_. It enriches\nthe sound of the voice, and gives a finer quality to musical\ninstruments.\n\nECHOES.--When sounds are heard after the originals are emitted they tend\nto confusion, and the quality of resonance is lost. There are places\nwhere echoes are repeated many times. In the chateau of Simonetta,\nItaly, a sound will be repeated thirty times.\n\nSPEAKING TRUMPET.--This instrument is an example of the use of\nreflection. It is merely a bell-shaped, or flaring body, the large end\nof which is directed to the audience. The voice talking into the small\nend is directed forwardly, and is reflected from the sides, and its\nresonance also enables the vibrations to carry farther than without the\nuse of the solid part of the instrument.\n\nThe ear trumpet is an illustration of a sound-collecting device, the\nwaves being brought together by reflection.\n\nTHE STETHOSCOPE.--This is an instrument used by physicians, and it is so\ndelicate that the movements of the organs of the body can be heard with\ngreat distinctness. It merely collects the vibrations, and transmits\nthem to the ears by the small tubes which are connected with the\ncollecting bell.\n\nTHE VITASCOPE.--Numerous instruments have been devised to determine\nthe rate of vibration of different materials and structures, the most\nimportant being the _vitascope_, which has a revolvable cylinder,\nblackened with soot, and this being rotated at a certain speed, the\nstylus, which is attached to the vibrating body, in contact with the\ncylinder, will show the number per second, as well as the particular\ncharacter of each oscillation.\n\nTHE PHONAUTOGRAPH.--This instrument is used to register the vibration of\nwind instruments, as well as the human voice, and the particular forms\nof the vibrations are traced on a cylinder, the tracing stylus being\nattached to a thin vibrating membrane which is affected by the voice or\ninstrument.\n\nTHE PHONOGRAPH.--This instrument is the outgrowth of the stylus forms of\nthe apparatus described, but in this case the stylus, or needle, is\nfixed to a metallic diaphragm, and its point makes an impression on\nsuitable material placed on the outside of a revolvable cylinder or\ndisc.\n\nLight.-Light is the agent which excites the sensation of vision in the\neye. Various theories have been advanced by scientists to account for\nthe phenomenon, and the two most noted views are the _corpuscular_,\npromulgated by Sir Isaac Newton, and the _undulatory_, enunciated by\nHuygens and Euler.\n\nThe _corpuscular_ theory conceives that light is a substance of\nexceedingly light particles which are shot forth with immense velocity.\nThe _undulatory_ theory, now generally accepted, maintains that light is\ncarried by vibrations in ether. Ether is a subtle elastic medium which\nfills all space.\n\n_Luminous_ bodies are those like the sun, which emit light. Rays may\n_diverge_, that is, spread out; _converge_, or point toward each other;\nor they may be _parallel_ with each other.\n\nVELOCITY OF LIGHT.--Light moves at the rate of about 186,000 miles a\nsecond. As the sun is about 94,000,000 miles from the earth, it takes\n8-1/2 minutes for the light of the sun to reach us.\n\nREFLECTION.--One of the most important things connected with light is\nthat of reflection. It is that quality which is utilized in telescopes,\nmicroscopes, mirrors, heliograph signaling and other like apparatus and\nuses. The underlying principle is, that a ray is reflected, or thrown\nback from a mirror at the same angle as that which produces the light.\n\nWhen the rays of the sun, which are, of course, parallel, strike a\nconcave mirror, the reflecting rays are converged; and when the rays\nstrike a convex mirror they diverge. In this way the principle is\nemployed in reflecting telescopes.\n\nREFRACTION.--This is the peculiar action of light in passing through\nsubstances. If a ray passes through water at an angle to the surface the\nray will bend downwardly in passing through, and then again pass on in a\nstraight line. This will be noticed if a pencil is stood in a glass of\nwater at an angle, when it will appear bent.\n\nRefraction is that which enables light to be divided up, or analyzed. In\nthis way white light from the sun is shown to be composed of seven\nprincipal colors.\n\nCOLORS.--If the light is passed through a prism, which is a triangularly\nshaped piece of glass, the rays on emerging will diverge from each\nother, and when they fall on a wall or screen the colors red, orange,\nyellow, green, blue, indigo and violet are shown.\n\nThe reason for this is that the ray in passing through the prism has the\ndifferent colors in it refract at different angles, the violet bending\nmore than the red.\n\nTHE SPECTROSCOPE.--The ability to make what is thus called a _spectrum_,\nbrought forth one of the most wonderful instruments ever devised by man.\nIf any metal, or material, is fused, or put in such a condition that a\nray of light can be obtained from it, and this light is passed through a\nprism, it will be found that each substance has its own peculiar\ndivisions and arrangements of colors.\n\nIn this way substances are determined by what is called _spectrum\nanalysis_, and it is by means of this instrument that the composition of\nthe sun, and the planets and fixed stars are determined.\n\nTHE RAINBOW.--The rainbow is one of the effects of refraction, as the\nlight, striking the little globular particles of water suspended in the\nair, produces a breaking up of the white light into its component\ncolors, and the sky serves as a background for viewing the analysis thus\nmade.\n\nHEAT.--It is now conclusively proven, that heat, like light, magnetism\nand electricity, is merely a mode of motion.\n\nThe _mechanical_ theory of heat may be shown by rubbing together several\nbodies. Heat expands all substances, except ice, and in expanding\ndevelops an enormous force.\n\nEXPANSION.--In like manner liquids expand with heat. The power of\nmercury in expanding may be understood when it is stated that a pressure\nof 10,000 pounds would be required to prevent the expansion of mercury,\nwhen heated simply 10 degrees.\n\nGases also expand. While water, and the different solids, all have their\nparticular units of expansion, it is not so with gases, as all have the\nsame coefficient.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nHOW DRAUGHTING BECOMES A VALUABLE AID\n\n\nThe ability to read drawings is a necessary part of the boy's education.\nTo know how to use the tools, is still more important. In conveying an\nidea about a piece of mechanism, a sketch is given. Now, the sketch may\nbe readable in itself, requiring no explanation, or it may be of such a\nnature that it will necessitate some written description.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 95. Plain Circle_]\n\nLINES IN DRAWING.--In drawing, lines have a definite meaning. A plain\ncircular line, like Fig. 95, when drawn in that way, conveys three\nmeanings: It may represent a rim, or a bent piece of wire; it may\nillustrate a disk; or, it may convey the idea of a ball.\n\nSuppose we develop them to express the three forms accurately. Fig. 96,\nby merely adding an interior line, shows that it is a rim. There can be\nno further doubt about that expression.\n\nFig. 97 shows a single line, but it will now be noticed that the line is\nthickened at the lower right-hand side, and from this you can readily\ninfer that it is a disk.\n\nSHADING.--Fig. 98, by having a few shaded lines on the right and lower\nside, makes it have the appearance of a globe or a convex surface.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 96. Ring_\n_Fig. 97. Raised Surface_\n_Fig. 98. Sphere_]\n\nShading or thickening the lines also gives another expression to the\nsame circular line.\n\nIn Fig. 99, if the upper and left-hand side of the circle is heavily\nshaded, it shows that the area within the circle is depressed, instead\nof being raised.\n\nDIRECTION OF SHADE.--On the other hand, if the shading lines, as in Fig.\n100, are at the upper left-hand side, then the mind at once grasps the\nidea of a concave surface.\n\nThe first thing, therefore, to keep in mind, is this fact: That in all\nmechanical drawing, the light is supposed to shine down from the upper\nleft-hand corner and that, as a result, the lower vertical line, as well\nas the extreme right-hand vertical line, casts the shadows, and should,\ntherefore, be made heavier than the upper horizontal, and the left-hand\nvertical lines.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 99. Depressed Surface_ _Fig. 100. Concave_]\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule, which will be readily understood by\nfollowing out the illustrations in the order given below.\n\nPERSPECTIVES.--The utility of the heavy lines will be more apparent when\ndrawing square, rectangular, or triangular objects.\n\nLet us take Fig. 101, which appears to be the perspective of a cube.\nNotice that all lines are of the same thickness. When the sketch was\nfirst brought to me I thought it was a cube; but the explanation which\nfollowed, showed that the man who made the sketch had an entirely\ndifferent meaning.\n\nHe had intended to convey to my mind the idea of three pieces, A, B, C,\nof metal, of equal size, joined together so as to form a triangularly\nshaped pocket as shown in Fig. 101. The addition of the inner lines,\nlike D, quickly dispelled the suggestion of the cube.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 101. Fig. 102. Fig. 103. Fig. 104.\n Forms of Cubical Outlines_]\n\n\"But,\" he remarked, \"I want to use the thinnest metal, like sheets of\ntin; and you show them thick by adding the inner lines.\"\n\nSuch being the case, if we did not want to show thickness as its\nstructural form, we had to do it by making the lines themselves and the\nshading give that structural idea. This was done by using the single\nlines, as in Fig. 103, and by a slight shading of the pieces A, B, C.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 105. Fig. 106. Shading Edges_]\n\nTHE MOST PRONOUNCED LINES.--If it had been a cube, or a solid block, the\ncorners nearest the eye would have been most pronounced, as in Fig. 104,\nand the side next to the observer would have been darkest.\n\nThis question of light and shadow is what expresses the surface\nformation of every drawing. Simple strokes form outlines of the object,\nbut their thickness, and the shading, show the character enclosed by the\nLINES. DIRECTION OF LIGHT.--Now, as stated, the casting of the shadow\ndownward from the upper left-hand corner makes the last line over which\nit passes the thickest, and in Figs. 105 and 106 they are not the\nextreme lines at the bottom and at the right side, because of the close\nparallel lines.\n\nIn Figs. 109 and 110 the blades superposed on the other are very thin,\nand the result is the lines at the right side and bottom are made much\nheavier.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 107. Fig. 108. Illustrating Heavy Lines_]\n\nThis is more fully shown in Figs. 107 and 108. Notice the marked\ndifference between the two figures, both of which show the same set of\npulleys, and the last figure, by merely having the lower and the\nright-hand lines of each pulley heavy, changes the character of the\nrepresentation, and tells much more clearly what the draughtsman sought\nto convey.\n\nSCALE DRAWINGS.--All drawings are made to a scale where the article is\nlarge and cannot be indicated the exact size, using parts of an inch to\nrepresent inches; and parts of a foot to represent feet.\n\nIn order to reduce a drawing where a foot is the unit, it is always best\nto use one-and-a-half inches, or twelve-eighths of an inch, as the\nbasis. In this way each eighth of an inch represents an inch. If the\ndrawing should be made larger, then use three inches, and in that way\neach inch would be one-quarter of an inch.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 109. Fig. 110. Lines on Plain Surfaces_]\n\nThe drawing should then have marked, in some conspicuous place, the\nscale, like the following: \"Scale, 1-1/2\" = 1'\"; or, \"Scale 3\" = 1'.\"\n\nDEGREE, AND WHAT IT MEANS.--A degree is not a measurement. The word is\nused to designate an interval, a position, or an angle. Every circle has\n360 degrees, and when a certain degree is mentioned, it means a certain\nangle from what is called a _base line_.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 111. Illustrating Degrees_]\n\nLook at Fig. 111. This has a vertical line A, and a horizontal line B.\nThe circle is thus divided into four parts, and where these lines A, B,\ncross the circle are the cardinal points. Each of the four parts is\ncalled a quadrant, and each quadrant has 90 degrees.\n\nAny line, like C, which is halfway between A and B, is 45 degrees.\nHalfway between A and C, or between B and C, like the line D, is 22-1/2\ndegrees.\n\nMEMORIZING ANGLES.--It is well to try and remember these lines by fixing\nthe angles in the memory. A good plan is to divide any of the quadrants\ninto thirds, as shown by the points E, F, and then remember that E is 30\ndegrees from the horizontal line B, and that F is 60 degrees. Or, you\nmight say that F is 30 degrees from the vertical line A, and E 60\ndegrees from A. Either would be correct.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 112. Section Lining_]\n\nSECTION LINING.--In representing many parts of a machine, or article, it\nis necessary to show the parts cut off, which must be illustrated by\nwhat is called \"section lining.\" Adjacent parts should have the section\nlines running at right angles to each other, and always at 45 degrees.\n\nLook at the outside and then the inside views of Fig. 112, and you will\nsee how the contiguous parts have the angles at right angles, and\nclearly illustrate how every part of the wrench is made. Skill in\ndepicting an article, for the purpose of constructing it from the\ndrawing, will make the actual work on the bench and lathe an easy one.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 113. Drawing an Ellipse_]\n\nMAKING ELLIPSES AND IRREGULAR CURVES.--This is the hardest thing to do\nwith drawing tools. A properly constructed elliptical figure is\ndifficult, principally, because two different sized curves are\nrequired, and the pen runs from one curve into the other. If the two\ncurves meet at the wrong place, you may be sure you will have a\ndistorted ellipse.\n\nFollow the directions given in connection with Fig. 113, and it will\ngive you a good idea of merging the two lines.\n\nFirst. Draw a horizontal line, A, which is in the direction of the major\naxis of the ellipse--that is, the longest distance across. The narrow\npart of the ellipse is called the minor axis.\n\nSecond. Draw a perpendicular line, B, which we will call the center of\nthe ellipse, where it crosses the line A. This point must not be\nconfounded with the _focus_. In a circle the focus is the exact center\nof the ring, but there is no such thing in an ellipse. Instead, there\nare two focal points, called the _foci_, as you will see presently.\n\nThird. Step off two points or marking places, as we shall term them,\nequidistant from the line B, and marked C, C. These marks will then\nrepresent the diameter of the ellipse across its major axis.\n\nFourth. We must now get the diameter of the minor axis, along the line\nB. This distance will depend on the perspective you have of the figure.\nIf you look at a disk at an angle of about 30 degrees it will be half of\nthe distance across the major axis.\n\nSo you may understand this examine Fig. 114. The first sketch shows the\neye looking directly at the disk 1. In the second sketch the disk is at\n30 degrees, and now the lines 2 2, from the eye, indicate that it is\njust half the width that it was when the lines 3 3 were projected. The\nmarks D D, therefore, indicate the distance across the minor axis in\nFig. 113.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 114. Perspection in Angles_]\n\nFifth. We must now find the focal points of the ellipse. If the line A\non each side of the cross line B is divided into four parts, the outer\nmarks E may be used for the foci, and will be the places where the point\nof the compass, or bow pen, is to be placed.\n\nSixth. Describe a circle F, so it passes through the mark C, and move\nthe point of the compass to the center of the ellipse, at the star, and\ndescribe a circle line G, from the mark C to the line B. This will give\na centering point H. Then draw a line I from H to E, and extend it\nthrough the circle F.\n\nSeventh. If the point of the compass is now put at H, and the pencil or\npen on the circle line F, the curve J can be drawn, so the latter curve\nand the curve F will thus merge perfectly at the line I.\n\nTHE FOCAL POINTS.--The focal points can be selected at any arbitrary\npoint, between C and the line B, and the point H may be moved closer to\nor farther away from the line A, and you will succeed in making the\nellipse correct, if you observe one thing, namely: The line I, which\nmust always run from H to E, and intersects the circle F, is the\nstarting or the ending point for the small curve F or the large circle\nJ.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 115. Fig. 116. Fig. 117. Perspectives of Cubes_]\n\nISOMETRIC AND PERSPECTIVE.--A figure may be drawn so as to show an\nisometric or a perspective view. Thus, a cube can be drawn so as to make\nan isometric figure, as in Fig. 115, where the three sides are equal to\neach other.\n\nIsometric means a method of drawing any object in such a manner that the\nheight, length and breadth may be shown in the proportion they really\nbear to each other. Fig. 115 has the sides not only equal to each other,\nin appearance to the eye, but they have the same outlines and angles.\n\nContrast this figure with Figs. 116 and 117. In Fig. 116 two of the\nsides are equal in angles and outline; and in Fig. 117 each side has a\ndifferent outline, and different angles. Nevertheless, all the cubes\nare, in reality, of the same dimension.\n\nTHE PROTRACTOR.--This is a most useful tool for the draughtsman. It\nenables the user to readily find any angle. Fig. 118 shows an approved\nform of the tool for this purpose.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 118. Protractor. Section Lining Metals_]\n\nSUGGESTIONS IN DRAWING.--As in the use of all other tools, so with the\ndrawing instrument, it must be kept in proper order. If the points are\ntoo fine they will cut the paper; if too blunt the lines will be ragged.\nIn whetting the points hold the pen at an angle of 12 degrees. Don't\nmake too long an angle or slope, and every time you sharpen hold it at\nthe same angle, so that it is ground back, and not at the point only.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 119. Using the Protractor._]\n\nHOLDING THE PEN.--The drawing pen should be held as nearly vertical as\npossible. Use the cleaning rag frequently. If the ink does not flow\nfreely, after you have made a few strokes, as is frequently the case,\ngently press together the points. The least grit between the tines will\ncause an irregular flow.\n\nINKS.--As prepared liquid inks are now universally used, a few\nsuggestions might be well concerning them. After half the bottle has\nbeen used, add a half teaspoonful of water, shake it well, and then\nstrain it through a fine cotton cloth. This will remove all grit and\nlint that is sure to get into the bottle however carefully it may be\ncorked.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 120. Section Lining Metals_]\n\nTRACING CLOTH.--It is preferable to use the dull side of the tracing\ncloth for the reasons that, as the cloth is rolled with the glossy side\ninside, the figure when drawn on the other side will be uppermost, and\nwill thus lie flat; and on the other hand, the ink will take better on\nthe dull side.\n\nIf the ink does not flow freely, use chalk, fine pumice stone, or talc,\nand rub it in well with a clean cloth, and then wipe off well before\nbeginning to trace.\n\nDETAIL PAPER.--The detail paper, on which the drawing is first made in\npencil, should show the figure accurately, particularly the points where\nthe bow pen are to be used, as well as the measurement points for the\nstraight lines.\n\nHOW TO PROCEED.--Make the circles, curves, and irregular lines first,\nand then follow with the straight lines. Where the point of the circle\npen must be used for a large number of lines, as, for instance, in\nshading, the smallest circles should be made first, and the largest\ncircles last, because at every turn the centering hole becomes larger,\nand there is liability to make the circles more or less irregular. Such\nirregularity will not be so noticeable in the large curves as in the\nsmaller ones.\n\nINDICATING MATERIAL BY THE SECTION LINES.--In section lining different\nmaterials can be indicated by the character of the lines, shown in Fig.\n120.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTREATMENT AND USE OF METALS\n\n\nANNEALING.--A very important part of the novice's education is a\nknowledge pertaining to the annealing of metals. Unlike the artisan in\nwood, who works the materials as he finds them, the machinist can, and,\nin fact, with many of the substances, must prepare them so they can be\nhandled or cut by the tools.\n\nAnnealing is one of the steps necessary with all cutting tools, and it\nis an absolute requirement with many metals for ordinary use, as well as\nfor many other articles like glass. This is particularly true in the use\nof copper.\n\nTOUGHNESS AND ELASTICITY.--It means the putting of metals in such a\ncondition that they will not only be less brittle, but also tougher and\nmore elastic. Many substances, like glass, must be annealed before they\ncan be put in condition for use, as this material when first turned out\nis so brittle that the slightest touch will shatter it, so that it must\nbe toughened.\n\nMalleable or wrought iron, if subjected to pressure, becomes brittle,\nand it is necessary to anneal it. Otherwise, if used, for instance, for\nboiler plates, from the rolled sheets, it would stand but little\npressure.\n\nThe most immediate use the boy will have is the treatment of steel. He\nmust learn the necessity of this process, and that of tempering, in all\nhis cutting tools, and in the making of machinery where some parts are\nrequired to be constructed of very hard metal.\n\nTHE PROCESS.--To anneal steel it must be heated to a bright cherry red\nand then gradually cooled down. For this purpose a bed of fine charcoal,\nor iron filings and lime, is prepared, in which the article is embedded,\nand permitted to remain until it is cold.\n\nThere are many ways of doing the work, particularly in the use of\nsubstances which will the most readily give up their carbon to the tool.\nYellow prussiate of potash is an excellent medium, and this is sprinkled\nover the cherry-heated article to be annealed. The process may be\nrepeated several times.\n\nTEMPERING.--This is the reverse of annealing as understood in the art.\nThe word itself does not mean to \"harden,\" but to put into some\nintermediate state. For instance, \"tempered clay\" means a clay which has\nbeen softened so it can be readily worked.\n\nOn the other hand, a tempered steel tool is put into a condition where\nit is hardened, but this hardness is also accompanied by another\nquality, namely, _toughness_. For this reason, the word _temper_, and\nnot _hardness_, is referred to. A lathe tool, if merely hardened, would\nbe useless for that purpose.\n\nTEMPERING CONTRASTED WITH ANNEALING.--It will be observed that in\nannealing three things are necessary: First, heating to a certain\ntemperature; second, cooling slowly; third, the particular manner of\ncooling it.\n\nIn tempering, on the other hand, three things are also necessary:\n\nFirst: The heating temperature should be a dull red, which is less than\nthe annealing heat.\n\nSecond: Instead of cooling slowly the article tempered is dipped into a\nliquid which suddenly chills it.\n\nThird: The materials used vary, but if the article is plunged into an\nunguent made of mercury and bacon fat, it will impart a high degree of\ntoughness and elasticity.\n\nMATERIALS USED.--Various oils, fats and rosins are also used, and some\nacids in water are also valuable for this purpose. Care should be taken\nto have sufficient amount of liquid in the bath so as not to evaporate\nit or heat it up too much when it receives the heated body.\n\nDifferent parts of certain articles require varying degrees of hardness,\nlike the tangs of files. The cutting body of the file must be extremely\nhard, and rather brittle than tough. If the tang should be of the same\nhardness it would readily break.\n\n_Gradual Tempering._--To prevent this, some substance like soap suds may\nbe used to cool down the tang, so that toughness without hardness is\nimparted.\n\nThe tempering, or hardening, like the annealing process, may be repeated\nseveral times in succession, and at each successive heating the article\nis put at a higher temperature.\n\nIf any part of a body, as, for instance, a hammerhead, should require\nhardening, it may be plunged into the liquid for a short distance only,\nand this will harden the pole or peon while leaving the other part of\nthe head soft, or annealed.\n\nGlycerine is a good tempering substance, and to this may be added a\nsmall amount of sulphate of potash.\n\nFLUXING.--The word _flux_ means to fuse or to melt, or to put into a\nliquid state. The office of a flux is to facilitate the fusion of\nmetals. But fluxes do two things. They not only aid the conversion of\nthe metal into a fluid state, but also serve as a means for facilitating\nthe unity of several metals which make up the alloy, and aid in uniting\nthe parts of metals to be joined in the welding of parts.\n\nUNITING METALS.--Metals are united in three ways, where heat is used:\n\nFirst: By heating two or more of them to such a high temperature that\nthey melt and form a compound, or an alloy, as it is called.\n\nSecond: By heating up the points to be joined, and then lapping the\npieces and hammering the parts. This is called forge work or welding.\n\nThird: By not heating the adjacent parts and using an easily fusible\nmetal, which is heated up and run between the two, by means of a\nsoldering iron.\n\nThe foreign material used in the first is called a flux; in the second\nit is termed a welding compound; and in the third it is known as a\nsoldering acid, or soldering fluid.\n\nThe boy is not so much interested in the first process, from the\nstandpoint of actual work, but it is necessary that he should have some\nunderstanding of it.\n\nIt may be said, as to fluxes, generally, that they are intended to\npromote the fusion of the liquefying metals, and the elements used are\nthe alkalis, such as borax, tartar, limestone, or fluor spar.\n\nThese substances act as reducing or oxidizing agents. The most important\nare carbonate of soda, potash, and cyanide of potassium. Limestone is\nused as the flux in iron-smelting.\n\nWELDING COMPOUNDS.--Elsewhere formulas are given of the compounds most\ndesirable to use. It is obvious that the application of these substances\non the heated surfaces, is not only to facilitate the heating, but to\nprepare the articles in such a manner that they will more readily adhere\nto each other.\n\nOXIDATION.--Oxidation is the thing to guard against in welding. The\nmoment a piece of metal, heated to whiteness, is exposed, the air coats\nit with a film which is called an _oxide_. To remove this the welding\ncompound is applied.\n\nThe next office of the substance thus applied, is to serve as a medium\nfor keeping the welding parts in a liquid condition as long as possible,\nand thus facilitate the unity of the joined elements.\n\nWhen the hammer beats the heated metals an additional increment of heat\nis imparted to the weld, due to the forcing together of the molecules of\nthe iron, so that these two agencies, namely, the compound and the\nmechanical friction, act together to unite the particles of the metal.\n\nSOLDERING.--Here another principle is involved, namely, the use of an\nintermediate material between two parts which are to be united. The\nsurfaces to be brought together must be thoroughly cleaned, using such\nagents as will prevent the formation of oxides.\n\nThe parts to be united may be of the same, or of different materials,\nand it is in this particular that the workman must be able to make a\nchoice of the solder most available, and whether hard or soft.\n\nSOFT SOLDER.--A soft solder is usually employed where lead, tin, or\nalloys of lead, tin and bismuth are to be soldered. These solders are\nall fusible at a low temperature, and they do not, as a result, have\ngreat strength.\n\nBismuth is a metal which lowers the fusing point of any alloy of which\nit forms a part, while lead makes the solder less fusible.\n\nHARD SOLDER.--These are so distinguished because they require a\ntemperature above the low red to fuse them. The metals which are alloyed\nfor this purpose are copper, silver, brass, zinc and tin. Various alloys\nare thus made which require a high temperature to flux properly, and\nthese are the ones to use in joining steel to steel, the parts to be\nunited requiring an intense furnace heat.\n\nSPELTER.--The alloy used for this purpose is termed \"spelter,\" and\nbrass, zinc and tin are its usual components. The hard solders are used\nfor uniting brass, bronze, copper, and iron.\n\nWhether soft or hard solder is used, it is obvious that it must melt at\na lower temperature than the parts which are to be joined together.\n\nThere is one peculiarity with respect to alloys: They melt at a lower\ntemperature than either of the metals forming the alloys.\n\nSOLDERING ACID.--Before beginning the work of soldering, the parts must\nbe cleaned by filing or sandpapering, and coated with an acid which\nneutralizes the oxygen of the air.\n\nThis is usually muriatic acid, of which use, say, one quart and into\nthis drop small pieces of zinc. This will effervesce during the time the\nacid is dissolving the zinc. When the boiling motion ceases, the liquid\nmay be strained, or the dark pieces removed.\n\nThe next step is to dissolve two ounces of sal ammoniac in a third of a\npint of water, and in another vessel dissolve an ounce of chloride of\ntin.\n\nThen mix the three solutions, and this can be placed in a bottle, or\nearthen jar or vessel, and it will keep indefinitely.\n\nTHE SOLDERING IRON.--A large iron is always better than a small one,\nparticularly for the reason that it will retain its heat better. This\nshould always be kept tinned, which can be done by heating and plunging\nit into the soldering solution, and the solder will then adhere to the\niron and cover the point, so that when the actual soldering takes place\nthe solder will not creep away from the tool.\n\nBy a little care and attention to these details, the work of uniting\nmetals will be a pleasure. It is so often the case, however, that the\napparatus for doing this work is neglected in a shop; the acid is\nallowed to become dirty and full or foreign matter, and the different\nparts separated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nON GEARING AND HOW ORDERED\n\n\nThe technical name for gears, the manner of measuring them, their pitch\nand like terms, are most confusing to the novice. As an aid to the\nunderstanding on this subject, the wheels are illustrated, showing the\napplication of these terms.\n\nSPUR AND PINION.--When a gear is ordered a specification is necessary.\nThe manufacturer will know what you mean if you use the proper terms,\nand you should learn the distinctions between spur and pinion, and why a\nbevel differs from a miter gear.\n\nIf the gears on two parallel shafts mesh with each other, they both may\nbe of the same diameter, or one may be larger than the other. In the\nlatter case, the small one is the pinion, and the larger one the spur\nwheel.\n\nSome manufacturers use the word \"gear\" for \"pinion,\" so that, in\nordering, they call them _gear_ and _pinion_, in speaking of the large\nand small wheels.\n\nMEASURING A GEAR.--The first thing to specify would be the diameter. Now\na spur gear, as well as a pinion, has three diameters; one measure\nacross the outer extremities of the teeth; one measure across the wheel\nfrom the base of the teeth; and the distance across the wheel at a point\nmidway between the base and end of the teeth.\n\nThese three measurements are called, respectively, \"outside diameter,\"\n\"inside diameter,\" and \"pitch diameter.\" When the word _diameter_ is\nused, as applied to a gear wheel, it is always understood to mean the\n\"pitch diameter.\"\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 121. Spur Gears_]\n\nPITCH.--This term is the most difficult to understand. When two gears of\nequal size mesh together, the pitch line, or the _pitch circle_, as it\nis also called, is exactly midway between the centers of the two\nwheels.\n\nNow the number of teeth in a gear is calculated on the pitch line, and\nthis is called:\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 122. Miter Gear Pitch_]\n\nDIAMETRAL PITCH.--To illustrate: If a gear has 40 teeth, and the pitch\ndiameter of the wheel is 4 inches, there are 10 teeth to each inch of\nthe pitch diameter, and the gear is then 10 _diametral pitch_.\n\nCIRCULAR PITCH.--Now the term \"circular pitch\" grows out of the\nnecessity of getting the measurement of the distance from the center of\none tooth to the center of the next, and it is measured along the pitch\nline.\n\nSupposing you wanted to know the number of teeth in a gear where the\npitch diameter and the diametral pitch are given. You would proceed as\nfollows: Let the diameter of the pitch circle be 10 inches, and the\ndiameter of the diametral pitch be 4 inches. Multiplying these together\nthe product is 40, thus giving the number of teeth.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 123. Bevel Gears._]\n\nIt will thus be seen that if you have an idea of the diametral pitch and\ncircular pitch, you can pretty fairly judge of the size that the teeth\nwill be, and thus enable you to determine about what kind of teeth you\nshould order.\n\nHOW TO ORDER A GEAR.--In proceeding to order, therefore, you may give\nthe pitch, or the diameter of the pitch circle, in which latter case the\nmanufacturer of the gear will understand how to determine the number of\nthe teeth. In case the intermeshing gears are of different diameters,\nstate the number of teeth in the gear and also in the pinion, or\nindicate what the relative speed shall be.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 124. Miter Gears._]\n\nThis should be followed by the diameter of the hole in the gear and also\nin the pinion; the backing of both gear and pinion; the width of the\nface; the diameter of the gear hub; diameter of the pinion hub; and,\nfinally, whether the gears are to be fastened to the shafts by key-ways\nor set-screws.\n\nFig. 122 shows a sample pair of miter gears, with the measurements to\nindicate how to make the drawings. Fig. 123 shows the bevel gears.\n\nBEVEL AND MITER GEARS.--When two intermeshing gears are on shafts which\nare at right angles to each other, they may be equal diametrically, or\nof different sizes. If both are of the same diameter, they are called\nbevel gears; if of different diameters, miter gears.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 125. Sprocket Wheel._]\n\nIt is, in ordering gears of this character, that the novice finds it\nmost difficult to know just what to do. In this case it is necessary to\nget the proper relation of speed between the two gears, and, for\nconvenience, we shall, in the drawing, make the gears in the relation of\n2 to 1.\n\nDRAWING GEARS.--Draw two lines at right angles, Fig. 124, as 1 and 2,\nmarking off the sizes of the two wheels at the points 3, 4. Then draw a\nvertical line (A) midway between the marks of the line 2, and this will\nbe the center of the main pinion.\n\nAlso draw a horizontal line (B) midway between the marks on the vertical\nline (1), and this will represent the center of the small gear. These\ntwo cross lines (A, B) constitute the intersecting axes of the two\nwheels, and a line (5), drawn from the mark (3 to 4), and another line\n(6), from the axes to the intersecting points of the lines (1, 2), will\ngive the pitch line angles of the two wheels.\n\nSPROCKET WHEELS.--For sprocket wheels the pitch line passes centrally\nthrough the rollers (A) of the chain, as shown in Fig. 125, and the\npitch of the chain is that distance between the centers of two adjacent\nrollers. In this case the cut of the teeth is determined by the chain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nMECHANICAL POWERS\n\n\nTHE LEVER.--The lever is the most wonderful mechanical element in the\nworld. The expression, _lever_, is not employed in the sense of a stick\nor a bar which is used against a fulcrum to lift or push something with,\nbut as the type of numerous devices which employ the same principle.\n\nSome of these devices are, the wedge, the screw, the pulley and the\ninclined plane. In some form or other, one or more of these are used in\nevery piece of mechanism in the world.\n\nBecause the lever enables the user to raise or move an object hundreds\nof times heavier than is possible without it, has led thousands of\npeople to misunderstand its meaning, because it has the appearance, to\nthe ignorant, of being able to manufacture power.\n\nWRONG INFERENCES FROM USE OF LEVER.--This lack of knowledge of first\nprinciples, has bred and is now breeding, so-called perpetual motion\ninventors (?) all over the civilized world. It is surprising how many\nmen, to say nothing of boys, actually believe that power can be made\nwithout the expenditure of something which equalizes it.\n\nThe boy should not be led astray in this particular, and I shall try to\nmake the matter plain by using the simple lever to illustrate the fact\nthat whenever power is exerted some form of energy is expended.\n\nIn Fig. 126 is a lever (A), resting on a fulcrum (B), the fulcrum being\nso placed that the lever is four times longer on one side than on the\nother. A weight (C) of 4 pounds is placed on the short end, and a\n1-pound weight (D), called the _power_, on the short end. It will thus\nbe seen that the lever is balanced by the two weights, or that the\n_weight_ and the _power_ are equal.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 126. Simple Lever_]\n\nTHE LEVER PRINCIPLE.--Now, without stopping to inquire, the boy will\nsay: \"Certainly, I can understand that. As the lever is four times\nlonger on one side of the fulcrum than on the other side, it requires\nonly one-fourth of the weight to balance the four pounds. But suppose I\npush down the lever, at the point where the weight (D) is, then, for\nevery pound I push down I can raise four pounds at C. In that case do I\nnot produce four times the power?\"\n\nI answer, yes. But while I produce that power I am losing something\nwhich is equal to the power gained. What is that?\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 127. Lever Action_]\n\nFirst: Look at Fig. 127; the distance traveled. The long end of the\nlever is at its highest point, which is A; and the short end of the\nlever is at its lowest point C. When the long end of the lever is pushed\ndown, so it is at B, it moves four times farther than the short end\nmoves upwardly, as the distance from C to D is just one-fourth that from\nA to B. The energy expended in moving four times the distance balances\nthe power gained.\n\nPOWER VS. DISTANCE TRAVELED.--From this the following law is deduced:\nThat whatever is gained in power is lost in the distance traveled.\n\nSecond: Using the same figure, supposing it was necessary to raise the\nshort end of the lever, from C to D, in one second of time. In that case\nthe hand pressing down the long end of the lever, would go from A to B\nin one second of time; or it would go four times as far as the short\nend, in the same time.\n\nPOWER VS. LOSS IN TIME.--This means another law: That what is gained in\npower is lost in time.\n\nDistinguish clearly between these two motions. In the first case the\nlong end of the lever is moved down from A to B in four seconds, and it\nhad to travel four times the distance that the short end moves in going\nfrom C to D.\n\nIn the second case the long end is moved down, from A to B, in one\nsecond of time, and it had to go that distance in one-fourth of the\ntime, so that four times as much energy was expended in the same time to\nraise the short end from C to D.\n\nWRONGLY DIRECTED ENERGY.--More men have gone astray on the simple\nquestion of the power of the lever than on any other subject in\nmechanics. The writer has known instances where men knew the principles\ninvolved in the lever, who would still insist on trying to work out\nmechanical devices in which pulleys and gearing were involved, without\nseeming to understand that those mechanical devices are absolutely the\nsame in principle.\n\nThis will be made plain by a few illustrations. In Fig. 128, A is a\npulley four times larger, diametrically, than B, and C is the pivot on\nwhich they turn. The pulleys are, of course, secured to each other. In\nthis case we have the two weights, one of four pounds on the belt, which\nis on the small pulley (B), and a one-pound weight on the belt from the\nlarge pulley (A).\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 128. The Pulley_]\n\nTHE LEVER AND THE PULLEY.--If we should substitute a lever (D) for the\npulleys, the similarity to the lever (Fig. 127) would be apparent at\nonce. The pivot (C) in this case would act the same as the pivot (C) in\nthe lever illustration.\n\nIn the same manner, and for like reasons, the wedge, the screw and the\nincline plane, are different structural applications of the principles\nset forth in the lever.\n\nWhenever two gears are connected together, the lever principle is used,\nwhether they are the same in size, diametrically, or not. If they are\nthe same size then no change in power results; but instead, thereof, a\nchange takes place in the direction of the motion.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 129. Fig. 130. Change of Direction_]\n\nWhen one end of the lever (A) goes down, the other end goes up, as shown\nin Fig. 129; and in Fig. 130, when the shaft (C) of one wheel turns in\none direction, the shaft of the other wheel turns in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nIt is plain that a gear, like a lever, may change direction as well as\nincrease or decrease power. It is the thorough knowledge of these facts,\nand their application, which enables man to make the wonderful machinery\nwe see on every hand.\n\nSOURCES OF POWER.--Power is derived from a variety of sources, but what\nare called the _prime movers_ are derived from heat, through the various\nfuels, from water, from the winds and from the tides and waves of the\nocean. In the case of water the power depends on the head, or height, of\nthe surface of the water above the discharging orifice.\n\nWATER POWER.--A column of water an inch square and 28 inches high gives\na pressure at the base of one pound; and the pressure at the lower end\nis equal in all directions. If a tank of water 28 inches high has a\nsingle orifice in its bottom 1\" x 1\" in size, the pressure of water\nthrough that opening will be only one pound, and it will be one pound\nthrough every other orifice in the bottom of the same size.\n\nCALCULATING FUEL ENERGY.--Power from fuels depends upon the expansion of\nthe materials consumed, or upon the fact that heat expands some element,\nlike water, which in turn produces the power. One cubic inch of water,\nwhen converted into steam, has a volume equal to one cubic foot, or\nabout 1,700 times increase in bulk.\n\nAdvantage is taken of this in steam engine construction. If a cylinder\nhas a piston in it with an area of 100 square inches, and a pipe one\ninch square supplies steam at 50 pounds pressure, the piston will have\n50 pounds pressure on every square inch of its surface, equal to 5,000\npounds.\n\nTHE PRESSURE OR HEAD.--In addition to that there will also be 50 pounds\npressure on each square inch of the head, as well as on the sides of the\ncylinder.\n\nFig. 131 shows a cylinder (A), a piston (B) and a steam inlet port (C),\nin which is indicated how the steam pressure acts equally in all\ndirections. As, however, the piston is the only movable part, the force\nof the steam is directed to that part, and the motion is then\ntransmitted to the crank, and to the shaft of the engine.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 131. Steam Pressure_]\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 132. Water Pressure_]\n\nThis same thing applies to water which, as stated, is dependent on its\nhead. Fig. 132 represents a cylinder (D) with a vertically movable\npiston (E) and a standpipe (F). Assuming that the pipe (F) is of\nsufficient height to give a pressure of 50 pounds to the square inch,\nthen the piston (E) and the sides and head of the cylinder (D) would\nhave 50 pounds pressure on every square inch of surface.\n\nFUELS.--In the use of fuels, such as the volatile hydrocarbons, the\ndirect expansive power of the fuel gases developed, is used to move the\npiston back and forth. Engines so driven are called _Internal Combustion\nMotors_.\n\nPOWER FROM WINDS.--Another source of power is from the wind acting\nagainst wheels which have blades or vanes disposed at such angles that\nthere is a direct conversion of a rectilinear force into circular\nmotion.\n\nIn this case power is derived from the force of the moving air and the\ncalculation of energy developed is made by considering the pressure on\neach square foot of surface. The following table shows the force exerted\nat different speeds against a flat surface one foot square, held so that\nthe wind strikes it squarely:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------+--------------++-------------------+--------------\nSPEED OF WIND    |   PRESSURE   || SPEED OF WIND     |   PRESSURE\n-----------------+--------------++-------------------+--------------\n5 Miles per hour |        2 oz. || 35 miles per hour |  6 lb. 2 oz.\n10 \"        \"    |        8  \"  || 40   \"       \"    |  8  \"\n15 \"        \"    |  1 lb. 2  \"  || 45   \"       \"    | 10  \"  2  \"\n20 \"        \"    |  2  \"        || 50   \"       \"    | 12  \"  2  \"\n25 \"        \"    |  3  \"  2  \"  || 55   \"       \"    | 15  \"  2  \"\n30 \"        \"    |  4  \"  8  \"  || 60   \"       \"    | 18  \"\n-----------------+--------------++-------------------+--------------\n\nVARYING DEGREES OF PRESSURE.--It is curious to notice how the increase\nin speed changes the pressure against the blade. Thus, a wind blowing 20\nmiles an hour shows 2 pounds pressure; whereas a wind twice that\nvelocity, or 40 miles an hour, shows a pressure of 8 pounds, which is\nfour times greater than at 20 miles.\n\nIt differs, therefore, from the law with respect to water pressure,\nwhich is constant in relation to the height or the head--that is, for\nevery 28 inches height of water a pound pressure is added.\n\nPOWER FROM WAVES AND TIDES.--Many attempts have been made to harness the\nwaves and the tide and some of them have been successful. This effort\nhas been directed to the work of converting the oscillations of the\nwaves into a rotary motion, and also to take advantage of the to-and-fro\nmovement of the tidal flow. There is a great field in this direction for\nthe ingenious boy.\n\nA PROFITABLE FIELD.--In no direction of human enterprise is there such\na wide and profitable field for work, as in the generation of power. It\nis constantly growing in prominence, and calls for the exercise of the\nskill of the engineer and the ingenuity of the mechanic. Efficiency and\neconomy are the two great watchwords, and this is what the world is\nstriving for. Success will come to him who can contribute to it in the\nsmallest degree.\n\nCapital is not looking for men who can cheapen the production of an\narticle 50 per cent., but 1 per cent. The commercial world does not\nexpect an article to be 100 per cent, better. Five per cent. would be an\ninducement for business.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nON MEASURES\n\n\nHORSE-POWER.--When work is performed it is designated as horse-power,\nusually indicated by the letters H. P.; but the unit of work is called a\n_foot pound_.\n\nIf one pound should be lifted 550 feet in one second, or 550 pounds one\nfoot in the same time, it would be designated as one horse-power. For\nthat reason it is called a foot pound. Instead of using the figure to\nindicate the power exerted during one minute of time, the time is taken\nfor a minute, in all calculations, so that 550 multiplied by the number\nof seconds, 60, in a minute, equals 33,000 foot pounds.\n\nFOOT POUNDS.--The calculation of horse-power is in a large measure\narbitrary. It was determined in this way: Experiments show that the heat\nexpended in vaporizing 34 pounds of water per hour, develops a force\nequal to 33,000 foot pounds; and since it takes about 4 pounds of coal\nper hour to vaporize that amount of water, the heat developed by that\nquantity of coal develops the same force as that exercised by an average\nhorse exerting his strength at ordinary work.\n\nAll power is expressed in foot pounds. Suppose a cannon ball of\nsufficient weight and speed strikes an object. If the impact should\nindicate 33,000 pounds it would not mean that the force employed was one\nhorse-power, but that many foot pounds.\n\nIf there should be 60 impacts of 550 pounds each within a minute, it\nmight be said that it would be equal to 1 horse-power, but the correct\nway to express it would be foot pounds.\n\nSo in every calculation, where power is to be calculated, first find out\nhow many foot pounds are developed, and then use the unit of measure,\n33,000, as the divisor to get the horse-power, if you wish to express it\nin that way.\n\nIt must be understood, therefore, that horse-power is a simple unit of\nwork, whereas a foot pound is a compound unit formed of a foot paired\nwith the weight of a pound.\n\nENERGY.--Now _work_ and _energy_ are two different things. Work is the\novercoming of resistance of any kind, either by causing or changing\nmotion, or maintaining it against the action of some other force.\n\nEnergy, on the other hand, is the power of doing work. Falling water\npossesses energy; so does a stone poised on the edge of a cliff. In the\ncase of water, it is called _kinetic_ energy; in the stone _potential_\nenergy. A pound of pressure against the stone will cause the latter, in\nfalling, to develop an enormous energy; so it will be seen that this\nproperty resides, or is within the thing itself. It will be well to\nremember these definitions.\n\nHOW TO FIND OUT THE POWER DEVELOPED.--The measure of power produced by\nan engine, or other source, is so interesting to boys that a sketch is\ngiven of a Prony Brake, which is the simplest form of the Dynamometer,\nas these measuring machines are called.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 133. Prony Brake_]\n\nIn the drawing (A) is the shaft, with a pulley (A\u00b4), which turns in the\ndirection of the arrow (B). C is a lever which may be of any length.\nThis has a block (C\u00b4), which fits on the pulley, and below the shaft,\nand surrounding it, are blocks (D) held against the pulley by a chain\n(E), the ends of the chain being attached to bolts (F) which pass\nthrough the block (C\u00b4) and lever (C).\n\nNuts (G) serve to draw the bolts upwardly and thus tighten the blocks\nagainst the shaft. The free end of the lever has stops (H) above and\nbelow, so as to limit its movement. Weights (I) are suspended from the\nend of the lever.\n\n[Illustration: _Fig. 134. Speed Indicator_]\n\nTHE TEST.--The test is made as follows: The shaft is set in motion, and\nthe nuts are tightened until its full power at the required speed is\nbalanced by the weight put on the platform.\n\nThe following calculation can then be made:\n\nFor our present purpose we shall assume that the diameter of the pulley\n(A\u00b4) is 4 inches; the length of the lever (C), 3 feet; the speed of the\nshaft (A) and the pulley, 210 revolutions per minute; and the weight 600\npounds.\n\nNow proceed as follows:\n\n(1) Multiply the diameter of the pulley (A\u00b4) (4 inches) by 3.1416, and\nthis will give the circumference 12.5664 inches; or, 1.0472 feet.\n\n(2) Multiply this product (1.0472) by the revolutions per minute. 1.0472\n\u00d7 210 = 219.912. This equals the _speed_ of the periphery of the pulley.\n\n(3) The next step is to get the length of the lever (C) from the center\nof the shaft (A) to the point from which the weights are suspended, and\ndivide this by one-half of the diameter of the pulley (A\u00b4). 36\" \u00f7 2\" =\n18\", or 1-1/2 feet. This is the _leverage_.\n\n(4) Then multiply the _weight_ in pounds by the _leverage_. 600 \u00d7 1-1/2\n= 900.\n\n(5) Next multiply this product (900) by the _speed_, 900 \u00d7 219.912 =\n197,920.8, which means _foot pounds_.\n\n(6) As each horse-power has 33,000 foot pounds, the last product should\nbe divided by this figure, and we have 197,920.8 \u00f7 33,000 = 5.99 H. P.\n\nTHE FOOT MEASURE.--How long is a foot, and what is it determined by? It\nis an arbitrary measure. The human foot is the basis of the measurement.\nBut what is the length of a man's foot? It varied in different countries\nfrom 9 to 21 inches.\n\nIn England, in early days, it was defined as a measure of length\nconsisting of 12 inches, or 36 barleycorns laid end to end. But\nbarleycorns differ in length as well as the human foot, so the standard\nadopted is without any real foundation or reason.\n\nWEIGHT.--To determine weight, however, a scientific standard was\nadopted. A gallon contains 8.33 pounds avoirdupois weight of distilled\nwater. This gallon is divided up in two ways; one by weight, and the\nother by measurement.\n\nEach gallon contains 231 cubic inches of distilled water. As it has four\nquarts, each quart has 57-3/4 cubic inches, and as each quart is\ncomprised of two pints, each pint has nearly 29 cubic inches.\n\nTHE GALLON.--The legal gallon in the United States is equal to a\ncylindrical measure 7 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep.\n\nNotwithstanding the weights and dimensions of solids and liquids are\nthus fixed by following a scientific standard, the divisions into\nscruples, grains, pennyweights and tons, as well as cutting them up into\npints, quarts and other units, is done without any system, and for this\nreason the need of a uniform method has been long considered by every\ncountry.\n\nTHE METRIC SYSTEM.--As early as 1528, Fernal, a French physician,\nsuggested the metric system. Our own government recognized the value of\nthis plan when it established the system of coinage.\n\nThe principle lies in fixing a unit, such as a dollar, or a pound, or a\nfoot, and then making all divisions, or addition, in multiples of ten.\nThus, we have one mill; ten mills to make a dime; ten dimes to make a\ndollar, and so on.\n\nBASIS OF MEASUREMENT.--The question arose, what to use as the basis of\nmeasurement, and it was proposed to use the earth itself, as the\nmeasure. For this purpose the meridian line running around the earth at\nthe latitude of Paris was selected.\n\nOne-quarter of this measurement around the globe was found to be\n393,707,900 inches, and this was divided into 10,000,000 parts. Each\npart, therefore, was a little over 39.37 inches in length, and this was\ncalled a meter, which means _measure_.\n\nA decimeter is one-tenth of that, namely, 3.937 inches; and a decameter\n39.37, or ten times the meter, and so on.\n\nFor convenience the metrical table is given, showing lengths in feet and\ninches, in which only three decimal points are used.\n\nMetrical Table, showing measurements in feet and inches:\n\nMETRICAL TABLE, SHOWING MEASUREMENTS IN FEET\nAND INCHES\n\n------------------------------------------\n------------+--------------+--------------\n   Length   |    Inches    |    Feet\n------------+--------------+--------------\nMillimeter  |       0.039  |      0.003\nCentimeter  |       0.393  |      0.032\nDecimeter   |       3.937  |      0.328\nMeter       |      39.370  |      3.280\nDecameter   |     393.707  |     32.808\nHectometer  |    3937.079  |    328.089\nKilometer   |   39370.790  |   3280.899\nMyriameter  |  393707.900  |  32808.992\n------------+--------------+--------------\n\nMETRIC SYSTEM, SHOWING THE EQUIVALENTS\nIN OUR MEASURES\n\n1 Myriameter            = 5.4 nautical miles, or 6.21 statute\n                            miles.\n\n1 Kilometer             = 0.621 statute mile, or nearly 5/8\n                            mile.\n\n1 Hectometer            = 109.4 yards.\n\n1 Decameter             = 0.497 chain, 1.988 rods.\n\n1 Meter                 = 39.37 inches, or nearly 3 ft. 3-3/8\n                            inches.\n\n1 Decimeter             = 3.937 inches.\n\n1 Centimeter            = 0.3937 inch.\n\n1 Millimeter            = 0.03937 inch.\n\n1 Micron                = 1/25400 inch.\n\n1 Hectare               = 2.471 acres.\n\n1 Arc                   = 119.6 square yards.\n\n1 Centaire, or square\nmeter                   = 10.764 square feet.\n\n1 Decastere             = 13 cubic yards, or about 2-3/4\n                            cords.\n\n1 Stere, or cubic meter = 1.308 cubic yards, or 35.3 cubic\n                            feet.\n\n1 Decistere             = 3-1/2 cubic feet.\n\n1 Kiloliter             = 1 ton, 12 gal., 2 pints, 2 gills\n                            old wine measure.\n\n1 Hectoliter            = 22.01 Imperial gals., or 26.4\n                            U.

Clean afterwards with fine emery cloth.\n\nPlaster of paris is valuable for many purposes in a machine shop, but\nthe disadvantage in handling it is, that it sets so quickly, and its use\nis, therefore, very much limited. To prevent quick setting mix a small\namount of arrow root powder with the plaster before it is mixed, and\nthis will keep it soft for some time, and also increase its hardness\nwhen it sets.\n\nFor measuring purposes a tablespoon holds 1/2 ounce; a dessertspoon 1/4\nounce; a teaspoon 1/8 ounce; a teacupful of sugar weighs 1/2 pound; two\nteacupsful of butter weigh 1 pound; 1-1/3 pints of powdered sugar weigh\n1 pound; one pint of distilled water weighs 1 pound.\n\nOrdinarily, 450 drops of liquid are equal to 1 ounce; this varies with\ndifferent liquids, some being thicker in consistency than others, but\nfor those of the consistency of water the measure given is fairly\naccurate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE SIMPLICITY OF GREAT INVENTIONS, AND OF NATURE'S MANIFESTATIONS\n\n\nIf there is anything in the realm of mechanics which excites the wonder\nand admiration of man, it is the knowledge that the greatest inventions\nare the simplest, and that the inventor must take advantage of one law\nin nature which is universal in its application, and that is vibration.\n\nThere is a key to every secret in nature's great storehouse. It is not a\ncomplicated one, containing a multiplicity of wards and peculiar angles\nand recesses. It is the very simplicity in most of the problems which\nlong served as a bar to discovery in many of the arts. So extremely\nsimple have been some of the keys that many inventions resulted from\naccidents.\n\nINVENTION PRECEDES SCIENCE.--Occasionally inventions were brought about\nby persistency and energy, and ofttimes by theorizing; but science\nrarely ever aids invention. The latter usually precedes science. Thus,\nreasoning could not show how it might be possible for steam to force\nwater into a boiler against its own pressure. But the injector does\nthis.\n\nIf, prior to 1876, it had been suggested that a sonorous vibration could\nbe converted into an electrical pulsation, and transformed back again to\na sonorous vibration, science would have proclaimed it impossible; but\nthe telephone does it. Invention shows how things are done, and science\nafterwards explains the phenomena and formulates theories and laws which\nbecome serviceable to others in the arts.\n\nSIMPLICITY IN INVENTIONS.--But let us see how exceedingly simple are\nsome of the great discoveries of man.\n\nTHE TELEGRAPH.--The telegraph is nothing but a magnet at each end of a\nwire, with a lever for an armature, which opens and closes the circuit\nthat passes through the magnets and armature, so that an impulse on the\nlever, or armature, at one end, by making and breaking the circuit, also\nmakes and breaks the circuit at the other end.\n\nTELEPHONE.--The telephone has merely a disk close to but not touching\nthe end of a magnet. The sonorous vibration of the voice oscillates the\ndiaphragm, and as the diaphragm is in the magnetic field of the magnet,\nit varies the pressure, so called, causing the diaphragm at the other\nend of the wire to vibrate in unison and give out the same sound\noriginally imparted to the other diaphragm.\n\nTRANSMITTER.--The transmitter is merely a sensitized instrument. It\ndepends solely on the principle of light contact points in an electric\ncircuit, whereby the vibrations of the voice are augmented.\n\nPHONOGRAPH.--The phonograph is not an electrical instrument. It has a\ndiaphragm provided centrally with a blunt pin, or stylus. To make the\nrecord, some soft or plastic material, like wax, or tinfoil, is caused\nto move along so that the point of the stylus makes impressions in it,\nand the vibrations of the diaphragm cause the point to traverse a groove\nof greater or smaller indentations. When this groove is again presented\nto the stylus the diaphragm is vibrated and gives forth the sounds\noriginally imparted to it when the indentations were made.\n\nWIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.--Wireless telegraphy depends for its action on what\nis called induction. Through this property a current is made of a high\nelectro-motive force, which means of a high voltage, and this disturbs\nthe ether with such intensity that the waves are sent out in all\ndirections to immense distances.\n\nThe great discovery has been to find a mechanism sensitive enough to\ndetect the induction waves. The instrument for this purpose is called a\ncoherer, in which small particles cohere through the action of the\nelectric waves, and are caused to fall apart mechanically, during the\nelectrical impulses.\n\nPRINTING TELEGRAPH.--The printing telegraph requires the synchronous\nturning of two wheels. This means that two wheels at opposite ends of a\nwire must be made to turn at exactly the same rate of speed. Originally,\nthis was tried by clock work, but without success commercially, for the\nreason that a pendulum does not beat with the same speed at the equator,\nas at different latitudes, nor at altitudes; and temperature also\naffects the rate. The solution was found by making the two wheels move\nby means of a timing fork, which vibrates with the same speed\neverywhere, and under all conditions.\n\nELECTRIC MOTOR.--The direct current electric motor depends for its\naction on the principle that likes repel, and unlikes attract. The\ncommutator so arranges the poles that at the proper points, in the\nrevolution of the armature, the poles are always presented to each other\nin such a way that as they approach each other, they are opposites, and\nthus attract, and as they recede from each other they repel. A dynamo is\nexactly the same, except that the commutator reverses the operation and\nmakes the poles alike as they approach each other, and unlike as they\nrecede.\n\nSteel is simply iron, to which has been added a small per cent of\ncarbon.\n\nQuinine is efficient in its natural state, but it has been made\ninfinitely more effectual by the breaking up or changing of the\nmolecules with acids. Sulphate of quinine is made by the use of\nsulphuric acid as a solvent.\n\nEXPLOSIONS.--Explosions depend on oxygen. While this element does not\nburn, a certain amount of it must be present to support combustion.\nThus, the most inflammable gas or liquid will not burn or explode unless\noxygenized. Explosives are made by using a sufficient amount, in a\nconcentrated form, which is added to the fuel, so that when it is\nignited there is a sufficient amount of oxygen present to support\ncombustion, hence the rapid explosion which follows.\n\nVIBRATION IN NATURE.--The physical meaning of vibration is best\nillustrated by the movement of a pendulum. All agitation is vibration.\nAll force manifests itself in this way.\n\nThe painful brilliancy of the sun is produced by the rapid vibrations of\nthe rays; the twinkle of the distant star, the waves of the ocean when\nruffled by the winds; the shimmer of the moon on its crested surface;\nthe brain in thinking; the mouth in talking; the beating of the heart;\nall, alike, obey the one grand and universal law of vibratory motion.\n\nQUALITIES OF SOUND.--Sound is nothing but a succession of vibrations of\ngreater or less magnitude. Pitch is produced by the number of\nvibrations; intensity by their force; and quality by the character of\nthe article vibrated.\n\nSince the great telephone controversy which took place some years ago\nthere has been a wonderful development in the knowledge of acoustics, or\nsounds. It was shown that the slightest sound would immediately set into\nvibration every article of furniture in a room, and very sensitive\ninstruments have been devised to register the force and quality.\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHER'S PLATE.--It is known that the chemical action of an\nobject on a photographer's plate is due to vibration; each represents a\nforce of different intensity, hence the varying shades produced. Owing\nto the different rates of vibrations caused by the different colors, the\ndifficulty has been to photograph them, but this has now been\naccomplished. Harmony, or \"being in tune,\" as is the common expression,\nis as necessary in light, as in music.\n\nSome chemicals will bring out or \"develop,\" the pictures; others will\nnot. Colors are now photographed because invention and science have\nfound the harmonizing chemicals.\n\nQUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY.--One of the most remarkable of all the wonders of\nour age is what is known as duplex and quadruplex telegraphy. Every atom\nand impulse in electricity is oscillation. The current which transmits\na telegram is designated in the science as \"vibratory.\"\n\nBut how is it possible to transmit two or more messages over one wire at\nthe same time? It is by bringing into play the harmony of sounds. One\nmessage is sent in one direction in the key of A; another message in the\nother direction in B; and so any number may be sent, because the\nelectrical vibrations may be tuned, just like the strings of a violin.\n\nELECTRIC HARMONY.--Every sound produces a corresponding vibration in\nsurrounding objects. While each vibrates, or is capable of transmitting\na sound given to it by its vibratory powers, it may not vibrate in\nharmony.\n\nWhen a certain key of a piano is struck every key has a certain\nvibration, and if we could separate it from the other sounds, it would\nreflect the same sound as the string struck, just the same as the walls\nof a room or the air itself would convey that sound.\n\nBut as no two strings in the instrument vibrate the same number of times\neach second, the rapid movement of successive sounds of the keys do not\ninterfere with each other. If, however, there are several pianos in a\nroom, and all are tuned the same pitch, the striking of a key on one\ninstrument will instantly set in vibration the corresponding strings in\nall the other instruments.\n\nThis is one reason why a piano tested in a music wareroom has always a\nmore beautiful and richer sound than when in a drawing-room or hall,\nsince each string is vibrated by the other instrument.\n\nIf a small piece of paper is balanced upon the strings of a violin,\nevery key of the piano may be struck, except the one in tune, without\naffecting the paper; but the moment the same key is struck the vibration\nof the harmonizing pitch will unbalance the paper.\n\nThe musical sound of C produces 528 vibrations per second; D 616, and so\non. The octave above has double the number of vibrations of the lower\nnote. It will thus be understood why discord in music is not pleasant to\nthe ear, as the vibrations are not in the proper multiples.\n\nODORS.--So with odors. The sense of smell is merely the force set in\nmotion by the vibration of the elements. An instrument called the\n_odophone_ demonstrates that a scale or gamut exists in flowers; that\nsharp smells indicate high tones and heavy smells low tones. Over fifty\nodors have thus been analyzed.\n\nThe treble clef, note E, 4th space, is orange; note D, 1st space below,\nviolet; note F, 4th space above clef, ambergris. To make a proper\nbouquet, therefore the different odors must be harmonized, just the\nsame as the notes of a musical chord are selected.\n\nA BOUQUET OF VIBRATIONS.--The odophone shows that santal, geranium,\norange flower and camphor, make a bouquet in the key of C. It is easy to\nconceive that a beautiful bouquet means nothing more than an agreeable\nvibratory sensation of the olfactory nerves.\n\nTASTE.--So with the sense of taste. The tongue is covered with minute\ncells surrounded by nervous filaments which are set in motion whenever\nany substance is brought into contact with the surface. Tasting is\nmerely the movement of these filaments, of greater or less rapidity.\n\nIf an article is tasteless, it means that these filaments do not\nvibrate. These vibrations are of two kinds. They may move faster or\nslower, or they may move in a peculiar way. A sharp acute taste means\nthat the vibrations are very rapid; a mild taste, slow vibrations.\n\nWhen a pleasant taste is detected, it is only because the filaments are\nset into an agreeable motion. The vibrations in the tongue may become so\nrapid that it will be painful, just as a shriek becomes piercing to the\near, or an intense light dazzling to the eye; all proceed from the same\nphysical force acting on the brain.\n\nCOLOR.--Color, that seemingly unexplainable force, becomes a simple\nthing when the principles of vibration are applied, and this has been\nfully explained by the spectroscope and its operation.\n\nWhen the boy once appreciates that this force, or this motion in nature\nis just as simple as the great inventions which have grown out of this\nmanifestation, he will understand that a knowledge of these things will\nenable him to utilize the energy in a proper way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWORKSHOP RECIPES AND FORMULAS\n\n\nIn a work of this kind, dealing with the various elements, the boy\nshould have at hand recipes or formulas for everything which comes\nwithin the province of his experiments. The following are most carefully\nselected, the objects being to present those which are the more easily\ncompounded.\n\nADHESIVES FOR VARIOUS USES.--Waterproof glue. Use a good quality of\nglue, and dissolve it in warm water, then add one pound of linseed oil\nto eight pounds of the glue. Add three ounces of nitric acid.\n\nLeather or Card-board Glue. After dissolving good glue in water, to\nwhich a little turpentine has been added, mix it with a thick paste of\nstarch, the proportion of starch to glue being about two to every part\nof glue used. The mixture is used cold.\n\nA fine Belt Glue. Dissolve 50 ounces of gelatine in water, and heat\nafter pouring off the excess water. Then stir in five ounces of\nglycerine, ten ounces of turpentine, and five ounces of linseed oil\nvarnish. If too thick add water to suit.\n\nFor cementing Iron to Marble. Use 30 parts of Plaster of Paris, 10 parts\nof iron filings, and one half part of sal ammoniac. These are mixed up\nwith vinegar to make a fluid paste.\n\nTo cement Glass to Iron. Use 3 ounces of boiled linseed oil and 1 part\nof copal varnish, and into this put 2 ounces of litharge and 1 ounce of\nwhite lead and thoroughly mingle so as to make a smooth paste.\n\nWater-proof Cement. Boiled linseed oil, 6 ounces; copal, 6 ounces;\nlitharge, 2 ounces; and white lead, 16 ounces. To be thoroughly\nincorporated.\n\nTo unite rubber or leather to hard substances. One ounce of pulverized\ngum shellac dissolved in 9-1/2 ounces of strong ammonia, will make an\nelastic cement. Must be kept tightly corked.\n\nFor uniting iron to iron. Use equal parts of boiled oil, white lead,\npipe clay and black oxide of manganese, and form it into a paste.\n\nTransparent Cement. Unite 1 ounce of india rubber, 67 ounces of\nchloroform, and 40 ounces of mastic. This is to be kept together for a\nweek, and stirred at times, when it will be ready for use.\n\nTo Attach Cloth to Metal. Water 100 parts, sugar 10 parts, starch 20\nparts, and zinc chloride 1 part. This must be first stirred and made\nfree of lumps, and then heated until it thickens.\n\nUnited States Government Gum. Dissolve 1 part of gum arabic in water and\nadd 4 parts of sugar and 1 part of starch. This is then boiled for a\nfew minutes, and thinned down as required.\n\nTO MAKE DIFFERENT ALLOYS.--Silver-aluminum. Silver one-fourth part, and\naluminum three-fourth parts.\n\nBell-metal. Copper, 80 parts; tin, 20 parts. Or, copper, 72 parts; tin,\n26 parts; zinc, 2 parts. Or, copper 2; 1 of tin.\n\nBrass. Copper, 66 parts; zinc, 32 parts; tin, 1 part; lead, 1 part.\n\nBronzes.

Tin, 70 parts; mercury, 30 parts.\n\nBOILER COMPOUNDS.--To prevent scaling. Use common washing soda, or\nGlauber salts.\n\nTO DISSOLVE CELLULOID.--Use 50 parts of alcohol and 5 parts of camphor\nfor every 5 parts of celluloid. When the celluloid is put into the\nsolution it will dissolve it.\n\nTo Soften Celluloid. This may be done by simply heating, so it will\nbend, and by putting it in steam, it can be worked like dough.\n\nCLAY MIXTURE FOR FORGES.--Mix dry 20 parts of fire clay, 20 parts\ncast-iron turnings, one part of common salt, and 1/2 part sal ammoniac,\nand then add water while stirring, so as to form a mortar of the proper\nconsistency. The mixture will become very hard when heat is applied.\n\nA Modeling Clay. This is made by mixing the clay with glycerine and\nafterwards adding vaseline. If too much vaseline is added it becomes too\nsoft.\n\nFLUIDS FOR CLEANING CLOTHES, FURNITURE, ETC.--For Delicate Fabrics. Make\nstrong decoction of soap bark, and put into alcohol.\n\nNon-inflammable Cleaner. Equal parts of acetone, ammonia and diluted\nalcohol.\n\nTaking dried paint from clothing. Shake up 2 parts of ammonia water with\n1 part of spirits of turpentine.\n\nCleaning Furniture, etc. Unite 2.4 parts of wax; 9.4 parts of oil of\nturpentine; 42 parts acetic acid; 42 parts citric acid; 42 parts white\nsoap. This must be well mingled before using.\n\nRemoving Rust from Iron or Steel. Rub the surface with oil of tartar.\nOr, apply turpentine or kerosene, and after allowing to stand over\nnight, clean with emery cloth.\n\nFor Removing Ink Stains from Silver. Use a paste made of chloride of\nlime and water.\n\nTo clean Silver-Plated Ware. Make a mixture of cream of tartar, 2 parts;\nlevigated chalk, 2 parts; and alum, 1 part. Grind up the alum and mix\nthoroughly.\n\nCleaning a Gas Stove. Make a solution of 9 parts of caustic soda and 150\nparts of water, and put the separate parts of the stove in the solution\nfor an hour or two. The parts will come out looking like new.\n\nCleaning Aluminum. A few drops of sulphuric acid in water will restore\nthe luster to aluminum ware.\n\nOil Eradicator. Soap spirits, 100 parts; ammonia solution, 25; acetic\nether, 15 parts.\n\nDISINFECTANTS.--Camphor, 1 ounce; carbolic acid (75 per cent.), 12\nounces; aqua ammonia, 10 drachms; soft salt water, 8 drachms.\n\nWater-Closet Deodorant. Ferric chloride, 4 parts; zinc chloride, 5\nparts; aluminum chloride, 4 parts; calcium chloride, 5 parts; magnesium\nchloride, 3 parts; and water sufficient to make 90 parts. When all is\ndissolved add to each gallon 10 grains of thymol and a quarter-ounce of\nrosemary that had been previously dissolved in six quarts of alcohol.\n\nOdorless Disinfectants. Mercuric chloride, 1 part; cupric sulphate, 10\nparts; zinc sulphate, 50 parts; sodium chloride, 65 parts; water to make\n1,000 parts.\n\nEmery for Lapping Purposes. Fill a pint bottle with machine oil and\nemery flour, in the proportion of 7 parts oil and 1 part emery. Allow it\nto stand for twenty minutes, after shaking up well, then pour off half\nthe contents, without disturbing the settlings, and the part so poured\noff contains only the finest of the emery particles, and is the only\npart which should be used on the lapping roller.\n\nEXPLOSIVES.--Common Gunpowder. Potassium nitrate, 75 parts; charcoal, 15\nparts; sulphur, 10 parts.\n\nDynamite. 75 per cent. nitro-glycerine; 25 per cent. infusorial earth.\n\nGiant Powder. 36 per cent. nitro-glycerine; 48 per cent. nitrate of\npotash; 8 per cent. of sulphur; 8 per cent. charcoal.\n\nFulminate. Chlorate of potassia, 6 parts; pure lampblack, 4 parts;\nsulphur, 1 part. A blow will cause it to explode.\n\nFILES.--How to Keep Clean. Olive oil is the proper substance to rub over\nfiles, as this will prevent the creases from filling up while in use,\nand preserve the file for a longer time, and also enable it to do better\ncutting.\n\nTo Renew Old Files. Use a potash bath for boiling them in, and\nafterwards brush them well so as to get the creases clean. Then stretch\na cotton cloth between two supports, and after plunging the file into\nnitric acid, use the stretched cloth to wipe off the acid. The object is\nto remove the acid from the ridges of the file, so the acid will only\neat out or etch the deep portions between the ridges, and not affect the\nedges or teeth.\n\nFIRE PROOF MATERIALS OR SUBSTANCES.--For Wood. For the kind where it is\ndesired to apply with a brush, use 100 parts sodium silicate; 50 parts\nof Spanish white, and 100 parts of glue. It must be applied hot.\n\nAnother good preparation is made as follows: Sodium silicate, 350 parts;\nasbestos, powdered, 350 parts; and boiling water 1,000 parts.\n\nFor Coating Steel, etc. Silica, 50 parts; plastic fire clay, 10 parts;\nball clay, 3 parts. To be thoroughly mixed.\n\nFor Paper. Ammonium sulphate, 8 parts; boracic acid, 3 parts; borax, 2\nparts; water, 100 parts. This is applied in a liquid state to the paper\nsurface.\n\nFLOOR DRESSINGS.--Oil Stain. Neats' foot oil, 1 part; cottonseed oil, 1\npart; petroleum oil, 1 part. This may be colored with anything desired,\nlike burnt sienna, annatto, or other coloring material.\n\nBallroom Powder. Hard paraffine, 1 pound; powdered boric acid, 7 pounds;\noil of lavender, 1 drachm; oil of neroli, 20 minims.\n\nFOOT POWDERS.--For Perspiring Feet. Balsam Peru, 15 minims; formic\nacid, 1 drachm; chloral hydrate, 1 drachm; alcohol to make 3 ounces.\n\nFor Easing Feet. Tannaform, 1 drachm; talcum, 2 drachms; lycopodium, 30\ngrains.\n\nFrost Bites. Carbolized water, 4 drachms; nitric acid, 1 drop; oil of\ngeranium, 1 drop.\n\nGLASS.--To cut glass, hold it under water, and use a pair of shears.\n\nTo make a hole through glass, place a circle of moist earth on the\nglass, and form a hole in this the diameter wanted for the hole, and in\nthis hole pour molten lead, and the part touched by the lead will fall\nout.\n\nTo Frost Glass. Cover it with a mixture of 6 ounces of magnesium\nsulphate, 2 ounces of dextrine, and 20 ounces of water. This produces a\nfine effect.\n\nTo imitate ground glass, use a composition of sandarac, 2-1/2 ounces;\nmastic, 1/2 ounce; ether, 24 ounces; and benzine, 16 ounces.\n\nIRON AND STEEL.--How to distinguish them. Wash the metal and put it into\na solution of bichromate of potash to which has been added a small\namount of sulphuric acid. In a minute or so take out the metal, wash and\nwipe it. Soft steel and cast iron will have the appearance of an\nash-gray tint; tempered steels will be black; and puddled or refined\nirons will be nearly white and have a metallic reflection.\n\nTo Harden Iron or Steel. If wrought iron, put in the charge 20 parts, by\nweight, of common salt, 2 parts of potassium cyanide, .3 part of\npotassium bichromate, .15 part of broken glass.\n\nTo harden cast iron, there should be added to the charge the following:\nTo 60 parts of water, add 2-1/2 parts of vinegar, 3 parts of common\nsalt, and .25 part of hydrochloric acid.\n\nTo soften castings: Heat them to a high temperature and cover them with\nfine coal dust and allow to cool gradually.\n\nLACQUERS.--For Aluminum. Dissolve 100 parts of gum lac in 300 parts of\nammonia and heat for an hour moderately in a water bath. The aluminum\nmust be well cleaned before applying. Heat the aluminum plate\nafterwards.\n\nFor Brass. Make a compound as follows; Annatto, 1/4 ounce; saffro, 1/4\nounce; turmeric, 1 ounce; seed lac, 3 ounces; and alcohol, 1 pint. Allow\nthe mixture to stand for three days, then strain in the vessel which\ncontains the seed lac, and allow to stand until all is dissolved.\n\nFor Copper. Heat fine, thickly liquid amber varnish so it can be readily\napplied to the copper, and this is allowed to dry. Then heat the coated\nobject until it commences to smoke and turn brown.\n\nLUBRICANTS.--Heavy machinery oils. Use paraffine, 8 pounds; palm oil, 20\npounds; and oleonaptha, 12 pounds. Dissolve the paraffine in the\noleonaptha at a temperature of 160 degrees and then stir in the palm oil\na little at a time.\n\nFor Cutting Tools. Heat six gallons of water and put in three and a half\npounds of soft soap and a half gallon of clean refuse oil. It should be\nwell mixed.\n\nFor high-speed bearings. Use flaky graphite and kerosene oil. Apply this\nas soon as there is any indication of heating in the bearings.\n\nFor lathe centers, one part of graphite and four parts of tallow\nthoroughly mixed and applied will be very serviceable.\n\nFor Wooden Gears. Use tallow, 30 parts; palm oil; 20 parts; fish oil, 10\nparts; and graphite, 20 parts.\n\nPAPER.--FIRE PROOF PAPER.--Make the following solution: Ammonium\nsulphate, 8 parts; boracic acid, 3 parts; water, 100 parts. Mix at a\ntemperature of 120 degrees. Paper coated with this will resist heat.\n\nFilter Paper. Dip the paper into nitric acid of 1.433 specific gravity,\nand subsequently wash and dry it. This makes a fine filtering body.\n\nCarbon Paper. A variety of substances may be used, such as fine soot or\nivory black, ultramarine or Paris blue. Mix either with fine grain\nsoap, so it is of a uniform consistency and then apply to the paper with\na stiff brush, rubbing it in until it is evenly spread over the surface.\n\nTracing Paper. Take unsized paper and apply a coat of varnish made of\nequal parts of Canada balsam and oil of turpentine. To increase the\ntransparency give another coat. The sheets must be well dried before\nusing.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY.--Developers.\n\n1. Pure water, 30 ounces; sulphite soda, 5 ounces; carbonate soda, 2-1/2\nounces.\n\n2. Pure water, 24 ounces; oxalic acid, 15 grains; pyrogallic acid, 1\nounce.\n\nTo develop use of solution 1, 1 ounce; solution 2, 1/2 ounce; and water,\n3 ounces.\n\nStock solutions for developing: Make solution No. 1 as follows: water,\n32 ounces; tolidol, I ounce; sodium sulphate, 1-1/2 ounces.\n\nSolution No. 2: Water, 32 ounces; sodium sulphate.\n\nSolution No. 3: Water, 32 ounces; sodium carbonate, from 4 to 6 ounces.\n\nFixing bath. Add two ounces of S. P. C. clarifier (acid bisulphate of\nsodium) solution to one quart of hypo solution 1 in 5.\n\nClearing solution. Saturated solution of alum, 20 ounces; and\nhydrochloric acid, 1 ounce. Varnish. Brush over the negative a solution\nof equal parts of benzol and Japanese gold size.\n\nPLASTERS.--Court Plaster. Use good quality silk, and on this spread a\nsolution of isinglass warmed. Dry and repeat several times, then apply\nseveral coats of balsam of Peru. Or,\n\nOn muslin or silk properly stretched, apply a thin coating of smooth\nstrained flour paste, and when dry several coats of colorless gelatine\nare added. The gelatine is applied warm, and cooled before the fabric is\ntaken off.\n\nPLATING.--Bronze coating. For antiques, use vinegar, 1,000 parts; by\nweight, powdered bloodstone, 125 parts; plumbago, 25 parts. Apply with\nbrush.\n\nFor brass where a copper surface is desired, make a rouge with a little\nchloride of platinum and water, and apply with a brush.\n\nFor gas fixtures. Use a bronze paint and mix with it five times its\nvolume of spirit of turpentine, and to this mixture add dried slaked\nlime, about 40 grains to the pint. Agitate well and decant the clear\nliquid.\n\nCOLORING METALS.--Brilliant black for iron. Selenious acid, 6 parts;\ncupric sulphate, 10 parts; water 1,000 parts; nitric acid, 5 parts.\n\nBlue-black. Selenious acid, 10 parts; nitric acid, 5 parts; cupric\nsulphate; water, 1,000 parts. The colors will be varied dependent on\nthe time the objects are immersed in the solution.\n\nBrass may be colored brown by using an acid solution of nitrate of\nsilver and bismuth; or a light bronze by an acid solution of nitrate of\nsilver and copper; or black by a solution of nitrate of copper.\n\nTo copper plate aluminum, take 30 parts of sulphate of copper; 30 parts\nof cream of tartar; 25 parts of soda; and 1,000 parts of water. The\narticle to be coated is merely dipped into the solution.\n\nPOLISHERS.--Floor Polish. Permanganate of potash in boiling water,\napplied to the floor hot, will produce a stain, the color being\ndependent on the number of coats. The floor may them be polished with\nbeeswax and turpentine.\n\nFor Furniture. Make a paste of equal parts of plaster of paris, whiting,\npumice stone and litharge, mixed with Japan dryer, boiled linseed oil\nand turpentine. This may be colored to suit. This will fill the cracks\nof the wood. Afterwards rub over the entire surface of the wood with a\nmixture of 1 part Japan, 2 of linseed oil, and three parts of\nturpentine, also colored, and after this has been allowed to slightly\nharden, rub it off, and within a day or two it will have hardened\nsufficiently so that the surface can be polished.\n\nStove Polish. Ceresine, 12 parts; Japan wax, 10 parts; turpentine oil,\n100 parts; lampblack, 12 parts; graphite, 10 parts. Melt the ceresine\nand wax together, and cool off partly, and then add and stir in the\ngraphite and lampblack which were previously mixed up with the\nturpentine.\n\nPUTTY.--Black Putty. Whiting and antimony sulphide, and soluble glass.\nThis can be polished finely after hardening.\n\nCommon Putty. Whiting and linseed oil mixed up to form a dough.\n\nRUST PREVENTIVE.--For Machinery. Dissolve an ounce of camphor in one\npound of melted lard. Mix with this enough fine black lead to give it an\niron color. After it has been on for a day, rub off with a cloth.\n\nFor tools, yellow vaseline is the best substance.\n\nFor zinc, clean the plate by immersing in water that has a small amount\nof sulphuric acid in it. Then wash clean and coat with asphalt varnish.\n\nSOLDERS.--For aluminum. Use 5 parts of tin and 1 part of aluminum as the\nalloy, and solder with the iron or a blow pipe.\n\nYellow hard solder. Brass, 3-1/2 parts; and zinc, 1 part.\n\nFor easily fusing, make an alloy of equal parts of brass and zinc.\n\nFor a white hard solder use brass, 12 parts; zinc, 1 part; and tin, 2\nparts.\n\nSOLDERING FLUXES.--For soft soldering, use a solution of chloride of\nzinc and sal ammoniac. Powdered rosin is also used.\n\nFor hard soldering, borax is used most frequently.\n\nA mixture of equal parts of cryolite and barium chloride is very good in\nsoldering bronze or aluminum alloys.\n\nOther hard solders are alloyed as follows: brass, 4 parts; and zinc, 5\nparts. Also brass, 7 parts; and zinc, 2 parts.\n\nSteel Tempering-.-Heat the steel red hot and then plunge it into sealing\nwax.\n\nFor tempering small steel springs, they may be plunged into a fish oil\nwhich has a small amount of rosin and tallow.\n\nVARNISHES.--Black Varnish. Shellac, 5 parts; borax, 2 parts; glycerine,\n2 parts; aniline black, 6 parts; water, 45 parts. Dissolve the shellac\nin hot water and add the other ingredients at a temperature of 200\ndegrees.\n\nA good can varnish is made by dissolving 15 parts of shellac, and adding\nthereto 2 parts of Venice turpentine, 8 parts of sandarac, and 75 parts\nof spirits.\n\nA varnish for tin and other small metal boxes is made of 75 parts\nalcohol, which dissolves 15 parts of shellac, and 3 parts of turpentine.\n\nSEALING WAX.--For modeling purposes. White wax, 20 parts; turpentine, 5\nparts; sesame oil, 2 parts; vermilion, 2 parts.\n\nOrdinary Sealing. 4 pounds of shellac, 1 pound Venice turpentine, add 3\npounds of vermilion. Unite by heat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nHANDY TABLES\n\n\nTABLE OF WEIGHTS FOR ROUND AND SQUARE STEEL.\n\nThe Estimate is on the basis of Lineal Feet. 1 cu. ft. of Steel--490\nlbs.\n\n==========+===================+==========+===================\n          |                   |          |\n          | Weight in Pounds  |          | Weight in Pounds\n Sizes in |                   | Sizes in |\n  Inches  +---------+---------+  Inches  +---------+---------\n          |  Round  | Square  |          |  Round  | Square\n----------+---------+---------+----------+---------+---------\n   1/16   |   .110  |   .013  |  1-1/16  |  3.014  |  3.400\n   1/8    |   .042  |   .053  |  1-1/8   |  3.379  |  3.838\n   3/16   |   .094  |   .119  |  1-3/16  |  3.766  |  4.303\n   1/4    |   .167  |   .212  |  1-1/4   |  4.173  |  4.795\n   5/16   |   .261  |   .333  |  1-5/16  |  4.600  |  5.312\n   3/8    |   .375  |   .478  |  1-3/8   |  5.049  |  5.857\n   7/16   |   .511  |   .651  |  1-7/16  |  5.518  |  6.428\n   1/2    |   .667  |   .850  |  1-1/2   |  6.008  |  7.650\n   9/16   |   .845  |  1.026  |  1-9/16  |  6.520  |  7.650\n   5/8    |  1.043  |  1.328  |  1-5/8   |  7.051  |  8.301\n  11/16   |  1.262  |  1.608  |  1-11/16 |  7.604  |  8.978\n   3/4    |  1.502  |  1.913  |  1-3/4   |  8.178  | 10.41\n  13/16   |  1.773  |  2.245  |  1-13/16 |  8.773  | 11.17\n   7/8    |  2.044  |  2.603  |  1-7/8   |  9.388  | 11.95\n  15/16   |  2.347  |  2.989  |  1-15/16 | 10.02   | 12.76\n    1     |  2.670  |  3.400  |  2       | 10.68   | 13.60\n----------+---------+---------+----------+---------+---------\n\nWEIGHT OF FLAT STEEL BARS.\n\n=========+=============================================================\nThickness|\n   in    |                             Width\n Inches  |\n---------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+------+------\n   1/16  |  .212|  .265|  .32 |  .372|  .425|  .477|  .53|  .588|  .63\n   1/8   |  .425|  .53 |  .64 |  .745|  .85 |  .955| 1.06| 1.17 | 1.27\n   3/16  |  .638|  .797|  .957| 1.11 | 1.28 | 1.44 | 1.59| 1.75 | 1.91\n   1/4   |  .85 | 1.06 | 1.28 | 1.49 | 1.70 | 1.91 | 2.12| 2.34 | 2.55\n   5/16  | 1.06 | 1.33 | 1.59 | 1.86 | 2.12 | 2.39 | 2.65| 2.92 | 3.19\n   3/8   | 1.28 | 1.59 | 1.92 | 2.23 | 2.55 | 2.87 | 3.19| 3.51 | 3.83\n   7/16  | 1.49 | 1.85 | 2.23 | 2.60 | 2.98 | 3.35 | 3.72| 4.09 | 4.46\n   1/2   | 1.70 | 2.12 | 2.55 | 2.98 | 3.40 | 3.83 | 4.25| 4.67 | 5.10\n   9/16  | 1.92 | 2.39 | 2.87 | 3.35 | 3.83 | 4.30 | 4.78| 5.26 | 5.74\n   5/8   | 2.12 | 2.65 | 3.19 | 3.72 | 4.25 | 4.78 | 5.31| 5.84 | 6.38\n  11/16  | 2.34 | 2.92 | 3.51 | 4.09 | 4.67 | 5.26 | 5.84| 6.43 | 7.02\n   3/4   | 2.55 | 3.19 | 3.83 | 4.47 | 5.10 | 5.75 | 6.38| 7.02 | 7.65\n  13/16  | 2.76 | 3.45 | 4.14 | 4.48 | 5.53 | 6.21 | 6.90| 7.60 | 8.29\n   7/8   | 2.98 | 3.72 | 4.47 | 5.20 | 5.95 | 6.69 | 7.44| 8.18 | 8.93\n  15/16  | 3.19 | 3.99 | 4.78 | 5.58 | 6.38 | 7.18 | 7.97| 8.77 | 9.57\n    1    | 3.40 | 4.25 | 5.10 | 5.95 | 6.80 | 7.65 | 8.50| 9.35 |10.20\n---------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----+------+------\n\nAVOIRDUPOIS WEIGHT.\n\nFor Merchandise of all kinds.\n\n   16 Drams (dr.) make            1 Ounce (oz.)\n   16 Ounces make                 1 Pound (pd.)\n   25 Pounds make                 1 Quarter (qr.)\n    4 Quarters, or 100 lbs., make 1 Hundredweight (cwt.)\n   20 Hundredweights make         1 Ton (T.)\n2,240 Pounds make                 1 Long ton (L.

Whether it be in the direction\nof making some new tool, needed in some special work, or in devising a\nparticular movement, or mechanical expedient, the machinist must be\nprepared to meet the issues and decide on the best structural\narrangement.\n\nOpportunities also come daily to the workers in machine shops to a\ngreater extent than other artisans, because inventors in every line\nbring inventions to them to be built and experimentally tested.\n\nA knowledge of the rights and duties of inventors, and of the men who\nbuild the models, is very desirable; and for your convenience we append\nthe following information:\n\nThe inventor of a device is he who has conceived an idea and has put it\ninto some concrete form.\n\nA mere idea is not an invention.\n\nThe article so conceived and constructed, must be both _new_ and\n_useful_. There must be some utility. It may be simply a toy, or\nsomething to amuse.\n\nIf A has an idea, and he employs and pays B to work out the device, and\nput it into practical shape, A is the inventor, although B may have\nmaterially modified, or even wholly changed it. B is simply the agent or\ntool to bring it to perfection, and his pay for doing the work is his\ncompensation.\n\nAn inventor has two years' time within which he may apply for a patent,\nafter he has completed his device and begun the sale of it. If he sells\nthe article for more than two years before applying for a patent, this\nwill bar a grant.\n\nTwo or more inventors may apply for a patent, provided each has\ncontributed something toward bringing it to its perfected state. Each\ncannot apply separately. The patent issued will be owned by them\njointly.\n\nJoint owners of a patent are not partners, unless they have signed\npartnership papers respecting the patent. Because they are partners in\nsome other enterprise, disconnected from the patent, that does not\nconstitute them partners in the patent. They are merely joint owners.\n\nIf they have no special agreement with respect to the patent each can\ngrant licenses to manufacture, independently of the others, without\nbeing compelled to account to the others, and each has a right to sell\nhis interest without asking permission of the others.\n\nAn _inventor_ is one who has devised an invention. A _patentee_ is one\nwho owns a patent, or an interest in one, be he the inventor or not.\n\nThe United States government does not grant Caveats. The only protection\noffered is by way of patent.\n\nA patent runs for a period of seventeen years, and may be renewed by act\nof Congress only, for a further term of seven years.\n\nAn interference is a proceeding in the Patent Office to determine who is\nthe first inventor of a device. The following is a brief statement of\nthe course followed:\n\nWhen two or more applicants have applications pending, which, in the\nopinion of the Examiner, appear to be similar, the Office may declare an\ninterference.\n\nIf an applicant has an application pending, and the Examiner rejects it\non reference to a patent already issued, the applicant may demand an\ninterference, and the Office will then grant a hearing to determine\nwhich of the two is entitled to the patent.\n\nThe first step, after the declaration of interference, is to request\nthat each applicant file a preliminary statement, under oath, in which\nhe must set forth the following:\n\nFirst: The date of conception of the invention.\n\nSecond: Date of the first reduction to writing, or the preparation of\ndrawings.\n\nThird: Date of making of the first model or device.\n\nFourth: When a complete machine was first produced.\n\nThese statements are filed in the Patent Office, and opened on the same\nday, and times are then set for the respective parties to take\ntestimony.\n\nIf one of the parties was the first to conceive and reduce to practice,\nas well as the first to file his application, he will be adjudged to be\nthe first inventor, without necessitating the taking of testimony.\n\nIf, on the other hand, one was the first to conceive, and the other the\nfirst to file, then testimony will be required to determine the question\nof invention.\n\nThe granting of a patent is not conclusive that the patentee was, in\nreality, the first inventor. The law is that the patent must issue to\nthe _first_ inventor, and if it can be proven that another party was the\nfirst, a new patent will issue to the one who thus establishes his\nright. The Commissioner of Patents has no right to take away the patent\nfirst issued. Only the Courts are competent to do this.\n\nA patent is granted for the right to _make_, to _use_ and to _vend_.\n\nAn owner of a patent cannot sell the right only to make, or to sell, or\nto use. Such a document would be a simple license, only, for that\nparticular purpose.\n\nA patent may be sold giving a divided, or an undivided right.\n\nA divided right is where a State, or any other particular territorial\nright is granted. An undivided right is a quarter, or a half, or some\nother portion in the patent itself.\n\nIf an inventor assigns his invention, and states in the granting clause\nthat he conveys \"all his right and title in and to the invention,\" or\nwords to that effect, he conveys all his rights throughout the world.\n\nIf the conveyance says, \"all rights and title in and throughout the\nUnited States,\" he thereby reserves all other countries.\n\nIf a patent is issued, and the number and date of the patent are given,\nthe assignment conveys the patent for the United States only, unless\nforeign countries are specifically mentioned.\n\nTo convey an invention or patent, some definite number or filing date\nmust be given in the document, with sufficient clearness and certainty\nto show the intent of the assignor.\n\nAn invention does not depend on quantity, but on quality. It is that\nwhich produces a new and a useful _result_.\n\nIn the United States patents are granted for the purpose of promoting\nthe useful arts and sciences.\n\nIn England, and in many other foreign countries, patents are granted,\nnot on account of any merit on the part of the inventor, but as a favor\nof the crown, or sovereign.\n\nOriginally patents were granted by the crown for the exclusive privilege\nin dealing in any commodity, and for this right a royal fee was exacted.\n>From this fact the term _royalty_ originated.\n\nAn international agreement is now in force among nearly all countries,\nwhich respects the filing of an application in any country, for a period\nof one year in the other countries.\n\nIn making an application for a patent, a petition is required, a\nspecification showing its object, use, and particular construction,\nfollowed by a claim, or claims, and accompanied by a drawing, if the\ninvention will permit of it, (which must be made in black, with India\nink), and an oath.\n\nThe oath requires the following assertions: That the applicant is the\nfirst and original inventor of the device, and that he does not know\nand does not believe the same was ever known or used before his\ninvention or more than two years before his application.\n\nHe must also further allege that the invention was not patented or\ndescribed in any printed publication here or abroad, and not\nmanufactured more than two years prior to the application, and that he\nhas not made an application, nor authorized any one to do so more than\ntwo years prior to his application.\n\nThe first Government fee is $15, payable at the time of filing, and the\nsecond and final fee is $20, payable at the time the patent is ordered\nto issue.\n\nThe filing of an application for patent is a secret act, and the Patent\nOffice will not give any information to others concerning it, prior to\nthe issue of the patent.\n\n\n\n\nGLOSSARY OF WORDS\n\nUSED IN TEXT OF THIS VOLUME\n\n\nAbrupt.

U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n\nIn this work, the author has endeavored to present a book embracing\npractical information for those who may wish to build for private or\nexperimental use a set of wireless instruments which are more than toys\nbut yet not so expensive as the commercial apparatus.\n\nMany books have been published on the subject of wireless telegraphy,\nbut in them the interests of the novice have been rather neglected and\nin order to build an outfit he has been forced to rely upon a series of\ndisconnected articles published in the amateur periodicals.\n\nIt is the object of this book to show the construction of simple,\nefficient instruments by means of clear drawings, and to give enough\nelementary theory and practical hints to enable the experimenter to\nbuild a size and type in keeping with his needs and resources.\n\nThe tiresome \"how to make\" style has been avoided as far as possible.\nHistory and all unimportant details are omitted to give in their place a\nconcise explanation of the parts played by the different instruments and\nthe influence of developing their various factors.\n\nA small lathe and a set of taps and dies are necessary to produce\napparatus having a good appearance, but a little ingenuity displayed in\nadapting screws and parts of old electrical instruments oftentimes at\nhand will make these tools unnecessary.\n\nOrdinary precaution and plenty of time should be used in the work. It is\nobvious that if a large coil is to be made, it is well to insure its\nsuccessful completion by painstaking care and the use of proper\nmaterials. Neither is it wise to strain an instrument through becoming\nimpatient and using it before it is properly completed and adjusted.\n\nWherever possible instructions have been given regarding the adjustment\nof the apparatus, but it is only by actual practice that the operator\nwill acquaint himself with the most efficient manipulation.\n\nExtracts from articles contributed by the Author to _Popular\nElectricity_ have been used in the chapters on Spark Gaps, Oscillation\nDetectors and Telephone Receivers, through the courtesy of the editor,\nMr. H. W. Young.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer wishes to express his thanks to the United\nWireless Telegraph Company for views of their apparatus and to the other\nfirms who have loaned electrotypes and supplied information. To those\nwho have assisted in the preparation of the book, more especially to Mr.\nSafford Adams, for numerous suggestions and criticisms, the Author\ndesires to express his full acknowledgments.\n\n\nALFRED POWELL MORGAN.\n\nUPPER MONTCLAIR, N.J.\n\n_June_, 1910.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.\n\n\nThe success of the previous editions of this book has made a new and\nthird one necessary.\n\nThere have not been any startling changes or new discoveries made in the\nfield of wireless telegraphy since the first edition was published, but\nthe art has undergone a number of small changes and improvements which\nhave increased the efficiency and selectivity of the apparatus.\n\nSince then a federal law restricting and controlling wireless telegraphy\nhas been passed. Its effect has been to place wireless telegraphy upon a\nmore certain basis, and to give a recognized standing to the amateur\nexperimenter.\n\nThis new law has been included in this edition in the form of an\nappendix. The amateur will do well to read it carefully. Compliance with\nits regulations will prove beneficial rather than a hindrance.\n\nA fully illustrated chapter explaining exactly how to comply with the\nlaw and how to build the apparatus required has been added. Complete\ndescriptions of several new types of detectors are also included.\n\nAll old matter has been thoroughly revised and several illustrations\nreplaced by ones more up-to-date and of direct interest.\n\n\nALFRED P.

INTRODUCTORY.\n\n\nBeing desirous of keeping this book as far as possible within the limits\nprescribed by the title, it is not possible to go deeply into the theory\nof the propagation of electric waves, but at the same time it is not\ndeemed advisable to plunge suddenly into the construction of wireless\napparatus without giving some explanation of the underlying principles.\n\nIf the reader desires information upon this subject he is referred to\nFleming\u2019s \"Electric Wave Telegraphy\" or the same author\u2019s \"Elementary\nManual of Radio-telegraphy and Radio-telephony.\"\n\nThe explanations given in this chapter do not involve any actual theory\nof the transmission and reception of electric waves. They are merely\nintended to show the train of actions which take place and may be\nobserved in a physical sense. With this purpose in view, several\nreferences have been made to simple hydraulic apparatus and an analogy\ndrawn to render the explanation clearer.\n\n\n\nThe Transmission and Reception of Electric Waves.\n\n\nWireless telegraphy by means of electromagnetic waves may be divided\ninto four distinct operations, namely:\n\n  1. The generation of electrical oscillations.\n  2. The transformation of electrical oscillations into electrical\n     waves.\n  3. The transformation of electrical waves into electrical\n     oscillations.\n  4. The detection of the electrical oscillations.\n\nThe first two operations comprise those taking place at the transmitter,\nwhile the last two, which are the converse of the first, are in evidence\nonly when receiving.\n\n[Illustration: Fig 1. Hertz Oscillator and Resonator.]\n\nFig. 1 illustrates the original Hertz oscillator and resonator, which is\nthe simplest form a wireless installation may take. _T_ represents the\ntransmitting apparatus and _R_ the receptor. At the transmitting station\na telegraph key is placed in series with a battery and an induction\ncoil. Two large metal plates, _t_ and _t\u2019_, are connected to the\nopposite sides of the spark gap, which in turn is connected to the\nsecondary of the induction coil. When the key is pressed the electrical\ncircuit is completed and the voltage of the battery is raised\nsufficiently by the induction coil to charge the metal plates _t_ and\n_t\u2019_.\n\nThe key serves to break the current into periods corresponding to the\ndots and dashes of the telegraph code. When the high voltage of the\ninduction coil is impressed upon the plates they become charged, and\nbeing of opposite polarity, when at a maximum the energy rushes across\nthe gap and produces a disruptive spark. Each discharge, although\nappearing like a single spark passing in one direction, is in reality\nmade up of a large number of rapid oscillations or surgings. The first\npassage of current serves to more than discharge the plates and they\nbecome charged in the opposite direction. A reverse discharge then\noccurs which also oversteps itself, and thus the oscillations go on, but\ngradually become weaker and weaker until they die completely or are\ndamped out. The heated air of the spark gap becomes a conductor during\nthe passage of the spark, and the oscillations are enabled to surge back\nand forth at the rate of 15,000 to 1,000,000 per second, although the\nactual discharge may take only a fraction of a second.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Hydraulic Oscillator.]\n\nThe generation of electrical oscillations may perhaps be made more clear\nby reference to the hydraulic apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2. _T_ and\n_T\u2019_ are communicating tubes divided by an elastic membrane M. The tubes\nmay be likened to the metal plates _t_ and _t\u2019_ or the arms of the\noscillator. The membrane may be likened to the layer of air between the\nknobs which separates the opposite arms of the oscillator. _P_ is a pump\nconnected to the two tubes _T_ and _T\u2019_, and the broken lines in the\napparatus represent water. The pump corresponds to the induction coil in\nFig. 1, and the water to the secondary currents of the induction coil.\nWhen the pump is set in operation, the water is drawn from the tube _T_\nand injected into _T\u2019_. The pump valves prevent it from flowing back.\nWhen the level becomes very high in _T\u2019_, the great pressure distends\nthe membrane in the direction shown by the dotted line until finally it\nbursts and the water is allowed to flow with a rush into the tube T. But\nthe inertia of the water causes it to rise higher in the tube than its\nfinal position of equilibrium, while in returning and endeavoring to\nseek its level its inertia carries it below this position. Thus the\nwater oscillates back and forth until finally it comes to rest.\n\nSimilarly the difference of potential of the oscillator arms is not\nimmediately equalized upon the breaking down of the air gap, and the\napparatus becomes the seat of extremely rapid electrical oscillations,\nas explained above.\n\nAll space is supposed to be filled with a highly attenuated, invisible\nand weightless medium called ether. When the electrical oscillations\nsurge back and forth through the arms of the oscillator, portions of the\nenergy are thrown off from the apparatus and travel in enlarging circles\nlike the ripples on a pond. These consist of lines of dielectric stress\nor electrostatic flux which pass through the ether and constitute\nelectromagnetic waves.\n\nThe receptor or resonator _R_, Fig. 1, consists of a circle of wire\nhaving in it a small spark gap capable of minute adjustment. Two metal\nplates _r_ and _r\u2019_ are sometimes attached to the opposite sides of the\nspark gap. When the key is pressed at the transmitting station and waves\nare sent out through the ether, they strike the resonator and set up\ntherein electrical oscillations which pass across the gap in the shape\nof sparks.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. \"Hydraulic\" Transmitter and Receptor.]\n\nTo make the explanation clearer, let us consider Fig. 3 in which two\nfloats or blocks of wood are represented as resting on the surface of a\ntank or pool of water. One float, _A_, is connected by a rope and pulley\nso that by jerking the rope the float may be made to _oscillate_ and\ncause little ripples or waves to pass outwards in a gradually enlarging\ncircle. When the waves reach the float, _B_, they cause it to rise and\nfall with each wave or to oscillate and reproduce the movements of the\nfloat, _A_. Likewise the oscillations set up by a wireless transmitter\nare sent out into space to be caught and duplicated at the receiving\nstation. Of course this analogy to the propagation and reception of\nelectric waves is not the same as the true electrical actions, but is\nmerely a graphical, representation.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Simple Wireless Telegraph Transmitter and\nReceptor.]\n\nThe wireless telegraph outfit illustrated in Fig. 1 would not serve for\nmore than short distances of a few feet, and so a somewhat similar but\nmore efficient apparatus is employed in practice. Fig. 4 shows such a\nsystem in its simplest form. In this case the secondary or high\npotential leads of the induction coil are connected, one to an earth and\nthe other to an aerial or antenna composed of a number of bare copper\nwires insulated and suspended from a mast.\n\nAll electrically charged bodies are surrounded by an electrostatic field\nof force, the nature of which in theory is a state of strain.\n\nThe action of an induction coil connected as in Fig. 4 is to charge the\nupper part of the aerial above the spark gap, say with negative\nelectricity and establish a field of force in its vicinity varying in\narea from a few feet to several miles. When the charge reaches a certain\npotential it is sufficient to puncture the layer of air in the gap and a\nspark takes place, setting up electrical oscillations.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Electric Waves and Lines of Strain.]\n\nPrevious to the rupture of the spark gap, _lines of electric strain or\nforce_ stretch from the aerial to the earth on all sides as in the\ncenter of Fig. 5. A line of force may be defined as a curve drawn in the\nelectric field so that the direction of the curve is the same as that of\nthe electric intensity at that point.\n\nThe aerial and the earth act like the two metal plates in Fig. 1 or like\nthe opposite plates of a condenser. As soon as the air gap is punctured\nit becomes conductive and the aerial charge rushes down into the earth.\nWith the discharge, the strain in the electrostatic field is released\nand the aerial charge rushes down into the earth, but in so relaxing\nproduces a new current and builds up a strain around the antenna\nopposite in direction to the first. This process repeats itself very\nrapidly and electrical oscillations are thus set up in the antenna.\nEvery oscillation changes the direction of the magnetic flux or\ndielectric strain and causes the imaginary lines which originally\nstretched from the aerial to the earth to be displaced and the ends\nterminating at the aerial to run down it and form semi-loops or inverted\n\"U\u2019s\" standing with their ends on the earth in a circular ripple around\nthe aerial and moving away from it with the speed of light. In Fig. 5\nthree oscillations are supposed to have taken place. The shortest\ndistance between two adjacent points at which the electric strain is at\na maximum in the same direction and period of time is the _wave length_\nemitted by the aerial. The separate standing groups of dielectric strain\nmoving away from the antenna are electromagnetic waves. In the figure,\nthe adjacent groups are separated by half a wave length. These waves are\nemitted at right angles to the transmitting aerial, whence they pass\nthrough the ether to the other station. When they reach the receiving\naerial they set up electrical oscillations therein which are _too weak\nto be perceptible in the shape of sparks_ as in the original Hertz\noscillator and resonator because of the great distance separating the\nstations, so they are made to flow through a _detector_, which in Fig. 4\nis represented as being a crystal of a mineral called silicon. When the\nhigh frequency currents strike the silicon, they set up a weak pulsating\ndirect current. This action is due to a peculiar rectifying property of\nthe mineral. The direct current flows through the telephone receiver and\nproduces an audible sound. If the aerial and ground were connected\ndirectly to the terminals of the telephone receiver, without the\nsilicon, the oscillations would not pass because of the impeding or\nchoking action of the electro-magnets in the telephone receivers.\n\n*Tuning.*\u2014It is sometimes desirable that messages should be made\nselective or secretive. It is obvious that if there were several large\nstations in the same neighborhood they could not all operate at the same\ntime unless some means of preventing the stations from receiving more\nthan one message at a time were possible. This is the object in view of\nthe so-called \"tuning\" of wireless telegraphy. It also accomplishes a\nsecond purpose which is perhaps considered more important than the\nfirst. The length of the aerial may be too great or too short for the\namount of energy and the length of the waves which it emits or receives.\nWhen this is the case, the oscillations are quickly damped out and do\nnot generate very powerful waves or produce strong signals at the\nreceiving station and thus by properly adjusting the circuit all\nundesirable messages may be cut out as well as the signaling range\ngreatly increased. Every electrical circuit has a definite period or\nelectrical length, determined by its inductance and capacity. A circuit\nemits waves of only one length for given values of inductance and\ncapacity, and must also be of a certain length before it will respond to\nwaves sent out by another transmitter. The careful adjustment of a\ncircuit to emit or receive a given wave constitutes _tuning_.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Resonance Tube.]\n\nThis may be made more clear by the comparison of an electrical circuit\nwith a column of air. Fig. 6 represents a cross section of a glass tube,\n_T_, lying in a horizontal position and containing a cork, _C_, which\ncan be slid to various positions. By adjusting the cork we are able to\nobtain various depths of air in the tube from its open end, _M_, to the\ncork, _C_.\n\nWhen a vibrating tuning fork, _F_, is held opposite the open mouth and\nthe cork slid back and forth it is found that the sound of the tuning\nfork is greatly increased in volume at a certain position of the cork.\nIf the cork is then removed from this position the sound decreases in\nintensity. When the cork is in such a position that the sound of the\nfork is reenforced, we have secured resonance. When in this condition\nand the prong of the vibrating fork is moving toward the open mouth of\nthe tube a \"condensed\" pulse of air travels down the tube and back\nagain, having been reflected at the cork and reaching _M_ just as the\nprong of the fork begins its excursion away from the open mouth of the\ntube. When the prong of the fork is moving away from _M_ a \"rarefied\"\npulse of air moves from _M_ to _C_ and back again by the time the prong\nis ready to begin its next vibration. When the tube is not in resonance,\nthe successive condensations and rarefactions passing up and down the\nair column interfere with one another and decrease instead of increase\nthe sound of the tuning fork.\n\nIf we substitute the sound waves emitted by the tuning fork for high\nfrequency oscillations and the air column for the electrical circuit we\nmay readily see that by adjusting its length, resonance can be produced.\nIf the length of the air column is measured it will be found that the\nreenforcing of the sound of the fork reaches a maximum when the depth of\nthe air column is _one-fourth_ of the sound wave length given by the\nfork. Likewise resonance is produced in wireless telegraphy when the\nlength of the circuit is _approximately one-fourth_ the length of the\nwaves. Vice versa, the wave emitted from an ordinary closed circuit\ntransmitter is _approximately four times_ the length of the aerial wire.\nFor example, an aerial 25 meters long will emit waves having a length in\nthe neighborhood of 100 meters.\n\nAs stated above, tuning is accomplished and resonance or syntony\nestablished by varying the inductance and capacity of the circuit. The\ncapacity of a circuit may be defined as its relative ability to retain\nan electrical charge, while inductance is the property of an electric\ncircuit by virtue of which lines of force are developed around it.\n\nCapacity and inductance are opposite or reactive in their effects upon a\ncircuit. If the value of one is decreased the influence of the other in\nincreased. Fig. 7 and the following explanation will serve to illustrate\nthis.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Lag and Lead.]\n\nAlternating currents do not always keep step with the voltage impulses\nof a circuit. If there is inductance in the circuit, the current will\nlag behind the voltage, and if there is capacity, the impulses of the\ncurrent will lead. Fig. 7 _A_ illustrates the lag produced by inductance\nand _B_ the lead produced by capacity. In _A_ the impulses of the\ncurrent, represented by the full line, occur a little _later_ than those\nof the volts as represented by the dotted line. In _B_ the effect is\njust the opposite and the current leads. These reactive effects of\ninductance and capacity are very pronounced with the high frequency\ncurrents of wireless telegraphy, and, as stated before, are the factors\nwhich determine the period of the circuit.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Tuned Hydraulic Transmitter and Receptor.]\n\nTuning is represented graphically in Fig. 8. The two floats _A_ and _B_\nare not only resting on the surface of a pool of water as in Fig. 3 but\nare also suspended from the springs _S_ and _S\u2019_. The springs will have,\nlike a pendulum, a definite time of rising and falling, or period of\noscillation, depending upon their length. If we strike the float _A_ the\nspring will cause the float to rise and fall at a definite rate and send\nout a little wave or ripple with every oscillation. If the springs _S_\nand _S\u2019_ are of the same length, the float _B_ will be caused to\noscillate with every wave sent out by _A_, for, the periods of the\nsprings being equal, _B_ will be permitted to rise with a wave and fall\nagain just in time to be raised by the next oncoming ripple. On the\nother hand, if the springs are of different lengths, _B_ may only rise\nslightly and in falling meet an oncoming wave which will cause it to\nrise before it has reached its lowest point and so dampen or weaken its\noscillations that they either do not become very strong or are entirely\nobliterated. Thus several floats having different periods of oscillation\nmight be sending out ripples in the same pool, and the float _B_ could\nbe made to respond to any of them by adjusting the length of the spring.\n\nWe may also see in this illustration the part that tuning plays in\ncausing the apparatus to emit or receive more powerful impulses. When\nthe rope in the untuned apparatus illustrated in Fig. 3 is jerked, the\nblock _A_ oscillates only once or twice before a new jerk is required to\nkeep it in motion. In Fig. 8 it is quite the contrary, for when an\nimpulse has been given to the float _A_ it will oscillate much longer\nthan the untuned float before it requires to be set in motion again.\nLikewise the float _B_ in Fig. 8 will oscillate longer and more\npowerfully than the float _B_ in Fig. 3, when once it has been set in\nmotion.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Tuned Wireless Telegraph Transmitter and\nReceptor]\n\nFig. 9 shows a diagram of a simple wireless telegraph system employing\nan inductance and capacity for tuning the circuits. When the induction\ncoil is in operation it charges a condenser. The condenser discharges\nthrough the sending helix and across the spark gap. The sending helix is\nmerely a spiral coil of wire of large diameter, and constitutes the\ngreater part of the inductance in the circuit. Two movable contacts, _A_\nand _B_, make connections with the helix. The spark gap, condenser and\nlower portion of the helix up to the movable contact _A_ are known as\nthe closed circuit. By shifting _A_, more or less inductance may be\nincluded in the closed circuit until resonance is secured. The aerial,\nthe inductance from the contact _B_ down, the condenser and the ground\ncompose the open circuit. By varying the contact _B_ more or less\ninductance may be included in the open circuit and its period altered\nuntil the oscillatory currents of both circuits flow in the same period\nof time. The closed and open portions of the transmitting helix form an\nauto transformer, and the voltages of the open circuit are raised above\nthose of the closed circuit.\n\nThe tuned receptor shown in Fig. 9 is the simplest form possible and is\nknown as the single slide system. The tuning coil or helix is much\nlonger in proportion to its diameter than the sending helix, and is made\nof finer wire, since it does not carry such heavy currents. When the\ncontact is slid up or down on the tuning coil, the inductance of the\ncircuit is varied. Since the oscillating currents in the receiving\naerial have the same frequency as those in the radiating aerial, the\nreceptor must have the same relative values of inductance and capacity.\nThis condition is obtained by varying the slider until the signals in\nthe telephone receivers are the loudest.\n\nIn practice more than one sliding contact is used, and these together\nwith adjustable condensers make the circuit more complicated. These\ndevices are necessary because oscillations may be forced on a receptor\nby a near-by transmitter unless other precautions than the \"single\nslider\" are taken. Such circuits are illustrated in Plates IV and V.\nWith them it is possible to obtain a considerable degree of selectivity\nand \"tune out\" an undesirable message.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE APPARATUS.\n\n\nIt is generally the receiving apparatus which first attracts the\nattention of the amateur operator, and so it will be considered first\nhere. An efficient receiving set consists of some form of _Detector,\nTuning Coil, Telephone Receivers_, and _Condenser_.\n\nOther accessories such as adjustable condensers, potentiometer, battery\nand testing buzzer improve the outfit and make it more complete.\n\nThe choice of the type of instruments must be left entirely to the\nperson who is constructing them. His resources will determine whether he\nis to use 1,000 ohm telephone receivers built especially for wireless\nwork or ordinary ones having a resistance of only 75 ohms. It is\ntherefore best to read carefully the chapters devoted to the different\npieces of receiving apparatus and select the type of detector, tuning\ncoil, etc., which it is desirable to use before commencing the\nconstruction of any.\n\nFor beginners, I would recommend an outfit consisting of a silicon\ndetector, a double slide tuning coil, a condenser of fixed capacity and\n75-ohm telephone receivers. Such an outfit with a 50-foot aerial will\nreceive messages about 150 miles. If 1,000 ohm telephone receivers are\nused, messages may be read up to 400 miles. Much depends upon the\nlocation of the station and the ability of the operator.\n\nA more elaborate and efficient set consists of an electrolytic or\n\"Perikon\" detector, a transforming tuner, two adjustable condensers, a\npotentiometer and a pair of 1,000 ohm telephone receivers. This outfit\nand a 75-foot aerial could be made to receive 500 to 1,000 miles by a\ncareful operator.\n\nSeveral cuts of wireless apparatus built for private installation are\nshown both in this chapter and further through the book, to give an idea\nof how the better instruments of this type are constructed and finished.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Long-distance Receiving Set.]\n\nFig. 10 illustrates a selective receiving set built by the Long Distance\nWireless Company. The set is mounted on a mahogany base and the\ninstruments are finished in polished hard rubber and lacquered brass.\nThey comprise a detector stand so arranged that any of the sensitive\nminerals used in wireless work may be used. The tuning coil is of the\ndouble slide type. The condenser is sealed up in a square lacquered\nbrass tube fitted with hard rubber ends and binding posts. The\narrangement and construction of the outfit may be readily understood\nfrom the cut.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Murdock Receiving Set.]\n\nFig. 11 illustrates a receiving set manufactured by the Wm. J. Murdock\nCompany. The tuning coil is fitted with hard rubber composition ends and\nis wound on a special core which is not affected by temperature changes.\nThe detector is of the crystal type and is of rather unique\nconstruction, since the small fixed condenser is mounted in the base of\nthe detector itself.\n\nThe Clapp-Eastham set in Fig. 12 employs a receiving transformer which\nmakes great selectivity possible. The detector is mounted at the\nleft-hand side of the outfit. A very sensitive mineral called \"Ferron\"\nis used in the detector. The fixed condenser is enclosed in a brass tube\nfitted with hard rubber ends and is located on the front of the base,\ndirectly in the center. A variable condenser of the rotary type is\nplaced at the right-hand corner.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Clapp-Eastham Receiving Set.]\n\nThe Prague Electric Company manufacture the apparatus shown in Fig. 13.\nThe cabinet is mahogany and is fitted with a hard rubber cover. A fixed\ncondenser and a double slide tuning coil are mounted within the cabinet.\nThe sliders of the tuning coil project through two long slots in the\ncabinet. A universal detector mounted on top of the cabinet is so\ndesigned that any material may be experimented with or tested.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Prague Receiving Set.]\n\nFig. 14 shows a receiving set built up from apparatus described in this\nbook. The cabinet is 12 x 16 inches and 4 inches deep. The wood should\nbe 1/2 inch thick, and in order to present a good appearance is\npreferably of mahogany. As mahogany is sometimes very hard to procure\nand expensive, some may find red birch an excellent substitute. When\nstained with a mahogany stain it presents a fine appearance.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Receiving Set.]\n\nVarnishing and polishing are wasted time when applied to the average\namateur\u2019s instruments in view of the rough handling and scratching which\nthey receive. The best plan is to stain the wood with an oil stain and\ngive it a wax finish. An oil stain contains no varnish but is merely\ncoloring matter and oil. A good coat should be applied with a wide brush\nand the surplus stain immediately wiped off by rubbing the whole surface\nwith a piece of cheesecloth. As soon as the stain is thoroughly dry the\nwood is waxed.\n\nCut up some beeswax into fine shreds and place it in a jar. Pour some\nturpentine over the beeswax and let the mixture stand for five or six\nhours, giving it an occasional stir. Allow it to stand further if\nnecessary until the wax melts and then add enough turpentine to give the\nmixture a consistency similar to that of thick cream. Apply the\npreparation to the wood with a rag, and then rub with a piece of clean\ncheesecloth until the finish is hard and dry. Waxing produces a gloss\nwhich is not so bright as a French polish but yet is more durable and\nnot so easily scratched or marred.\n\nA double slide tuning coil made as described in Chapter XIV is mounted\non top of the cabinet in the rear. A \"universal\" detector is mounted in\nthe center, directly in front of the tuning coil. A tubular condenser of\nfixed capacity is placed on the left-hand side of the detector, and a\npotentiometer on the opposite side. A double point switch placed\ndirectly in front of the detector enables the potentiometer to be\nbrought into play when a battery is used. Four binding posts are mounted\non the front of the cabinet. The ground and aerial are connected to the\nleft-hand pair and the telephone receivers to those on the right hand.\nThe wiring diagram is shown also in Fig. 14. By placing the switch _A_\non contact 1, the potentiometer is brought into use. When on contact 2,\nthe potentiometer is cut out. The switch _B_ must be opened when the\ndetector is not in use so as not to run down the battery.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Receiving Set.]\n\nFig. 15 shows a receiving set somewhat similar to that shown in Fig. 14\nbut more elaborate and efficient. The cabinet in this case measures 14 x\n22 inches and is 6 inches deep. A loosely coupled or transforming tuning\ncoil is used in place of the closely coupled double slide type. Two\nvariable condensers are mounted on either side of the tuning coil. The\ndetector and potentiometer occupy the space directly in front of the\ntuning coil, while a fixed condenser is placed at their right. The two\nswitches for breaking the battery circuit and disconnecting the\npotentiometer are in front of the detector. The aerial, ground and\ntelephone receiver leads are connected to binding posts mounted on the\nfront of the cabinet.\n\nThe batteries, in both cases, are placed inside the cabinet. The details\nand construction of all the separate instruments will be found in the\nrespective chapters as denoted by the titles.\n\n*Transmitting Range.*\u2014A simple transmitting outfit capable of sending\nabout two miles consists of the necessary batteries, a one-inch spark\ninduction coil, a small zinc spark gap and a key. The connections of\nsuch a transmitting outfit are shown in Fig. 4.\n\nIf the same coil is used with a transmitting helix and a condenser, the\nrange may be increased from 3 to 5 miles.\n\nA 1 1/2-inch spark induction coil using a condenser and a transmitting\nhelix will send about 10 miles, and a 3-inch coil under the same\nconditions about 20 miles. A 4 and a 6 inch coil will transmit about 30\nand 40 miles respectively.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Murdock Transmitting and Receiving Set.]\n\nThe one quarter kilowatt transformer with a helix and four two-quart\nleyden jars or an equivalent condenser will transmit at least 50 miles\nwith a suitable aerial. Used as a one half kilowatt transformer with a\nhelix and eight two-quart leyden jars, it will send about 100 miles.\n\nOf course, as in the case of the receiving outfits, these distances are\napproximate and depend upon the location of the station, the nature of\nthe ground over which the messages are transmitted, the kind of receptor\nused at the receiving station and the efficiency of the operator\nhimself.\n\nFig. 16 illustrates a complete Murdock transmitting and receiving set.\nThe transmitting outfit consists of a 15-watt induction coil giving\nabout a one-inch spark, a sending helix, oscillation condenser, a key\nand a double pole double throw switch for changing the antenna and\nground from the transmitting to the receiving instruments or vice versa.\nThe spark gap is mounted on top of the coil. The receiving outfit is the\nsame as that illustrated in Fig. 11.\n\n*A complete wireless station*\u2014outside of the aerial consists primarily\nof a source of electrical energy, a transformer or induction coil for\ncharging the oscillation condenser, an oscillation condenser, a\ntransmitting helix, a key for breaking the primary current, a spark gap,\nan aerial switch, a hot wire ammeter for tuning the transmitting\ncircuits, a detector, a receiving tuner, auxiliary tuning apparatus such\nas fixed and variable condensers, a potentiometer and battery, and a\npair of telephone receivers with a headband.\n\nOther apparatus such as switches, insulators, anchor gaps, testing\nbuzzers, reactance coils, grounding switches, etc., have been described\nin various places throughout the book and their use suggested whenever\nit is of any advantage.\n\nThe choice of transmitting instruments, as with the receiving apparatus,\nis left entirely with the experimenter so that he may suit his ideas and\nmeans. Wherever possible the range and power of the instruments have\nbeen given and suggestions made as to the other apparatus which should\nbe used in connection with them so that the completed outfit will bear\nsome sense of proportion.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. United Wireless Portable Outfit.]\n\nFig. 17 illustrates the portable wireless telegraph set manufactured by\nthe United Wireless Telegraph Company for army service and exploring\nexpeditions or isolated camps. The aerial and the mast can be unloaded,\nerected, and all parts be ready for operation in fifteen minutes. The\nmast is made of interchangeable wooden sections. The current for the\ntransmitter is furnished by a portable storage battery. The whole outfit\nis capable of furnishing efficient service for distances of 25 to 30\nmiles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. AERIALS AND EARTH CONNECTIONS.\n\n\nThe aerial or antenna ordinarily consists of a number of wires elevated\nin the air to emit or intercept the Hertzian waves. In fitting up a\nwireless station the location and erection of an aerial are of prime\nimportance, and the successful reception and transmission of wireless\nmessages will depend largely upon its condition.\n\nA few years ago the wireless antenna consisted of a metal plate high in\nthe air and having a wire suspended from it, but to-day usually exists\nin one of the forms illustrated in Plate II.\n\nThe higher an aerial is placed above the surface of the earth, the wider\nwill be its electrostatic field, and consequently more powerful\nelectrical waves will be developed. But after a height of 180-200 feet\nis attained, the engineering difficulties and the expenses increase so\nrapidly that few stations exceed it. Other things being equal, the\nincreased range in transmitting varies as the square of the height of\nthe radiating wires. For example, a 25-foot aerial capable of\ntransmitting one mile theoretically will send waves 16 miles if made 100\nfeet high. The actual ratio is often greater, but much is dependent upon\nthe many meteorological conditions.\n\nAfter the limit in a vertical direction has been reached, the only\nremaining possibilities are to increase the surface and spread out\nhorizontally.\n\nThe flat top aerials are used on shipboard or wherever it is an\nadvantage to suspend the wires between two masts.\n\nThey are especially recommended for amateur use, since they need not be\nso high as the other aerials, to be efficient. The flat top aerials are\n_directive_, that is, they receive or radiate waves better in certain\ndirections. The bent or inverted L type is one of these and exhibits a\npreference for waves coming from a direction opposite to that in which\nits free end points. This directive action of an inverted L antenna may\nbe somewhat lessened if the leads are taken off at the center and it is\nmade a T aerial. This is the most common form of flat top aerial in use\non ships.\n\nThe inverted U type is not used extensively because the two opposite\nleads or rat-tails make a centrally located operating room necessary.\nThe loop aerial is used by the United Wireless Company, in both their\nship and land stations. This type of aerial is well adapted to long\nwaves and close tuning.\n\nThe Lodge-Muirhead capacity aerial does not make use of a ground and is\nrarely seen in this country. Lately the United States Signal Corps have\napplied it to their balloons where an earth connection would be\nimpossible. The upper part of the balloon is covered with a network of\nwires which serves as the upper aerial, and a second system of wires is\nsuspended below the balloon to take the place of the ground. By this\nmeans they have had little difficulty in establishing successful\ncommunication between the balloons and the earth.\n\nThe pyramid aerial is the type used by Marconi in long-distance\nultra-powerful stations, but is debarred from extensive installation on\naccount of the large cost of erection.\n\nThe cage and grid aerials are of the vertical type and are excellent\nwhere a high support to elevate them can be secured. They are at present\nused principally by the Massie and Stone Companies.\n\n[Illustration: *Plate II. Aerial Systems.*]\n\nThe desirable feature of an aerial is a quantity known as its\nelectrostatic capacity and is measured by the charge required to raise\nits potential one unit. An increase in capacity enables more energy to\nbe accumulated in the antenna, and consequently greater radiation\nresults. The capacity of an aerial may be increased by adding wires, but\nmust not be carried too far or the transmitting apparatus will not be\nable to raise its potential sufficiently. Owing to an effect caused by\nmutual induction between the wires, the lines of strain are not\ndistributed symmetrically, and the capacity will not vary directly but\nrather approximately as the square root of the number of wires. In order\nto decrease this action and use the surface most efficiently, the wires\nshould not be placed nearer than one-fiftieth of their length and\npreferably farther apart.\n\nThe materials used for the insulation and suspension of an aerial must\nbe reliable, so that in event of bad weather the station will not lose\nenergy or be put out of working order because the aerial blew down.\n\nPorcelain cleats or a string of porcelain insulating knobs make\ninexpensive insulators. The standard insulator for wireless telegraph\nwork is the \"Electrose\" insulator. These are made of a molded\ncomposition, and have iron rings set firmly in the ends so that they can\nwithstand a very heavy strain. Hard rubber is undesirable for an aerial\ninsulator because it becomes carbonized and covered with a conducting\nlayer.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Electrose Insulators.]\n\nHigh frequency currents permeate copper wire only about one\nthree-hundredth of an inch, and so, in order to increase the surface and\ndecrease the resistance, it is best to make the aerial of stranded wire.\nA phosphor bronze wire for this purpose which is very flexible but still\ndoes not sag or stretch, is composed of 7 strands of No. 20 B. S. gauge.\nSuch a wire 150 feet long suspended vertically and insulated from the\nearth will have a capacity of from 0.0003 to 0.0004 of a microfarad.\n\nThe aerial must receive very particular attention if the station is one\nkilowatt or over in power. In that case stranded wire is necessary. The\ninsulation of the aerial must be as thorough as possible, and proximity\nto large conductors such as smokestacks, telephone lines, etc., avoided.\nRope stays and guys are advisable in order to prevent dissipation of\nenergy. If wire stays must be used they should be divided up at frequent\nintervals by insulators.\n\nFig. 19 illustrates a guy insulator used by the United Wireless\nTelegraph Company. It is made of two strips of well paraffined wood\nseparated by two porcelain knob insulators.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Guy Insulator.]\n\nCopper wire is the most desirable for an aerial. Iron wire must never be\nused unless it is very heavily galvanized, and even then it is not to be\nrecommended. Aluminum wire is undesirable except for kite sustained\naerials. When used on an aerial and exposed to smoke and other fumes it\nbecomes quickly coated with a layer of oxide. All connections made in\naluminum wire must be soldered. This necessity may be better understood\nwhen it is explained that electro-magnets on dynamos, etc., are\nsometimes wound with bare aluminum wire and that the natural coating of\noxide on the wire is sufficient insulation to separate the turns.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Insulating Tube.]\n\nWhere the aerial enters the building in which the instruments are\nlocated it must be very carefully insulated. The simplest method is to\nbore a hole through the wall and push a porcelain tube through it. The\nrat-tail or leading-in wire is then passed through and the interstices\nbetween it and the tube poured full of melted paraffin.\n\nThe best method is to bore a hole in the window pane and pass the wire\nthrough a hard rubber insulating tube. Fig. 20 shows such a tube. It is\nthree-quarters of an inch in outside diameter and has an internal bore\nof three-eighths of an inch. The tube is threaded throughout its entire\nlength. Two hard rubber flanges inch thick and 2 inches in diameter are\nthreaded to screw on the tube. The tube is inserted in the hole in the\nwindow pane and the flanges screwed on either side. If a soft rubber\nwasher is placed between the hard rubber flanges and the pane there will\nbe less likelihood of cracking the glass. The leading-in wire is then\npassed through the tube. The hole in the window pane may be bored by\nusing a copper tube having an external diameter equal to that of the\nrequired hole. The tube is set in a brace and used like an ordinary bit,\nbut must be kept well smeared with emery and oil or else it will not\ncut.\n\nThis method of leading in the rat-tail is the only one to be recommended\nif the transmitter is one-quarter kilowatt or over in power.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. High-tension Cable and Insulator.]\n\nThe lead-in should be anchored just outside of the window so as to\nrelieve the glass pane and the tube from all strain. Pirelli cable or\nthe high-tension cable which is used for the secondary wiring of an\nautomobile is the best conductor to use for the aerial in the interior\nof a building. The way to lead it over the ceiling is to support it on a\nporcelain cleat similar to that shown in Fig. 21.\n\nMany are under the erroneous impression that four times the length of\nthe aerial is the wave length which the station will emit. This is only\nat the best a very rough approximation, for many undeterminable factors\nsuch as the nature and location of surrounding objects, trees, etc., so\naffect the capacity and inductance of the aerial that the wave length\nmust be determined empirically after the aerial is in operation.\n\nThe standard wave length of the United States Navy for ship\ninstallations is 425 meters. An inverted L aerial, calculated before\nerection to have a wave length as near as possible to this, has the\nfollowing dimensions: Four horizontal stranded phosphor bronze wires (7\nstrands No. 20 B. S.) each 160 feet long and spaced 5 feet apart, four\nvertical wires 85 feet long and a 35-foot rat-tail.\n\nIt is always desirable that the wave length should be as long as\npossible, for the waves will then travel farther and are not absorbed to\nsuch an extent by trees, etc. The absorption due to trees is said to\nvary as the fourth power of the frequency.\n\nIt is sometimes very convenient to calculate the strain on insulators or\nmasts caused by a horizontal antenna. This is easily found by the\nfollowing equation:\n\n_P_ equals L\u00b2 x W/8S\n\nwhere _P_ is the required strain in lbs., _W_ the weight in lbs. per\nfoot of aerial, _L_ the length of the aerial and _S_ the sag of the wire\nin feet.\n\nWhen erecting an aerial, it is best to fasten a pulley at the top of the\nsupporting mast and hoist the aerial up after the pole is in position.\nThen in case the wires become twisted or broken they may be lowered and\nrepaired without any difficulty.\n\n*Erection of an Aerial.*\u2014The average amateur aerial is generally from 40\nto 60 feet high and supported at one end by a short pole placed on the\nhouse and at the other end by a mast set in the ground or lashed to a\ntree. Fig. 22 illustrates such an arrangement whereby a flat-top T\naerial is supported at one end by a short pole fastened to the house and\nat the other end by a pole set in the ground.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Flat-top T Aerial.]\n\nThe flat-top loop aerial is preferred by some amateurs and it is to be\nrecommended for receiving but is an inefficient radiator. When this type\nof aerial is used the two leading-in wires should be connected to a\nswitch so that when the switch is closed they are connected. The aerial\nmay then be used as a straight-away aerial for transmitting, and by\nopening the switch, as a loop aerial for receiving. This precaution is\nadvised when a loop aerial is to be used with a low-powered induction\ncoil as a transmitter, for otherwise there will be a loss of energy at\nthe anchor gap.\n\nA large aerial is of no advantage when used with a small transformer or\ninduction coil because it cannot become properly charged.\n\nTo erect a flat-top T aerial, first select its location. If possible\ntake advantage of two trees and lash a short pole in the top of each, so\nthat the aerial may be raised up clear of the leaves. Another good plan\nis to erect a pole at each end of the house. In any case, the distance\nseparating the poles must not be greater than three times the height\nabove ground or the directive action of the aerial will be very\npronounced. An aerial 50 to 60 feet high should have a length of from 80\nto 100 feet. Stranded wire is no advantage for receiving, but must be\nused if the transmitter is other than a small induction coil.\n\nSecure two spruce sticks about 2 inches in diameter and 10 feet long.\nFasten an insulator 6 inches from each end of the spars and two more\neach 3 J feet from the ends. This arrangement will separate each of the\nfour wires which compose the aerial by three feet.\n\nThe two spars are then laid on the ground at a distance apart equal to\nthe desired length of the aerial. Four wires, either stranded or No. 12\nB. S. gauge copper, are cut to equal lengths and fastened to the\ncorresponding insulators. The middle of each wire is found and a long\ncopper wire soldered to it. These four wires constitute the rat-tail or\nlead-in. They should be of the same length, and are not connected\ntogether until they are about to enter the building. A short rope tied\nto each end of the spars and fastened to the rope which passes over the\npulley on the top of the pole, serves as a bridle to prevent the aerial\nfrom twisting. The aerial is then hoisted up but allowed to hang\nslightly slack.\n\nThere is considerable difference of opinion among experts as to whether\nor not the ends of the horizontal wires should be connected, and it is\nimpossible to say with good reason which method is better. However, when\nerecting a flat top aerial, exercise every care to make all the wires of\nexactly the same length.\n\nAn aerial of the size and type just described will send and receive the\nfollowing distances.\n\nThese distances are only approximate and will vary with the efficiency\nof the operator and the location of the station.\n\nWhen any of the transformers described later are used, the aerial should\nbe 80 to 100 feet high. In this case the last named receiving outfit\nwill have a range of from 500 to 1,000 miles.\n\n*Ground Connections.*\u2014The importance of a good earth or ground\nconnection can hardly be overestimated. Whenever possible commercial\nstations are located on moist ground or near a body of water so that a\ngood ground may be secured by imbedding zinc or copper plates in the\nearth or water. A ground on shipboard is easily secured by fastening a\nconductor to one of the ship\u2019s plates.\n\nIf the ground connection is poor, the natural period of the oscillation\ncircuit is made irregular and short, so that the currents are choked in\npassing in and out of the earth. The result is an undesirable rise of\npotential at the lower end of the aerial and often harmful sparking at\nthe ground connection. The transmitting and receiving ranges of a\nstation are very considerably reduced through a poor earth.\n\nGround connection can often be obtained in the country by immersing\nmetal plates in a well or a cistern. Where connection is made to a water\nsupply pipe some sort of a ground clamp should be used to insure a good\ncontact.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Ground Clamp.]\n\nAn efficient earth for portable outfits may be quickly formed by\nspreading a large area of wire netting over the ground.\n\nProper precautions for protection against lightning by grounding the\naerial outside of the building should be taken.\n\nThe wisest plan is to install a heavy single pole double throw switch\noutside of the building where the rat-tail enters. The knife of the\nswitch should be connected to the aerial, one contact to the house lead\nand the other to a heavy wire grounded on the outside of the building as\nin Fig. 24. When the apparatus is not in use the aerial should be\ngrounded by throwing the switch on the grounded contact.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Switch for Lightning Protection.]\n\nThe rulings of the National Board of Fire Underwriters governing this\nclass of work are appended below.\n\n\"1. Aerial conductors to be permanently and effectively grounded at all\ntimes when the station is not in operation by a conductor not smaller\nthan No. 4 B. S. gauge copper wire, run in a direct line as possible to\nwater pipe on street side of said water pipe within the premises or to\nsome other equally satisfactory earth connection.\n\n\"2. Aerial conductors when grounded as above specified must be\neffectually cut off from all apparatus within the building.\n\n\"3. Or the aerial to be permanently connected at all times to earth in\nthe manner specified above, through a short gap lightning arrester; said\narrester to have a gap of not over .015 of an inch between brass or\ncopper plates not less than 2 1/2 inches in length, parallel to the gap,\nand 1 1/2 inches the other way, with a thickness of not less than\none-eighth of an inch, mounted on non-combustible, non-absorptive\ninsulating material of such dimensions as to give ample strength. Other\napproved arresters of equally low resistance and equally substantial\nconstruction may be used.\n\n\"4. In cases where the aerial is grounded as specified in paragraph 1,\nthe switch employed to join the aerial to the ground connection shall\nnot be smaller than a standard 100-ampere jack-knife switch.\n\n\"Notice of wiring done for these installations should be sent to the\nBoard, the same as for all other work.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. INDUCTION COILS.\n\n\nSome means of charging the condenser which produces the oscillatory\ndischarge is necessary. An induction coil is the most practical for the\namateur.\n\nThe induction coil consists of a primary coil of wire wound around a\ncentral iron core and surrounded by a secondary coil consisting of many\nthousand turns of carefully insulated wire. The primary coil is\nconnected to a source of direct current which also includes an\ninterrupter to \"make\" and \"break\" the current in rapid succession. Every\n\"make\" of the circuit and consequent magnetization of the core induces a\nmomentary inverse current in the secondary, and every \"break\" and\ncorresponding demagnetization a momentary direct current. Normally, the\ninduced currents would be equal, but by means of a condenser shunted\nacross the interrupter the circuit when \"made\" requires considerable\ntime for the current and magnetization of the core to reach a maximum\nvalue, while when broken the demagnetization and current drop are nearly\ninstantaneous. The value of the induced electromotive force in a circuit\nvaries as the speed at which the magnetic lines of force cut the\ncircuit, and so the induced e.m.f. at \"break\" is thus rendered high\nenough to leap across a gap in the shape of sparks.\n\nThe formulas connected with induction coils depend upon conditions which\nare never met in actual practice and cannot be relied upon. To construct\na coil of a given size, it is necessary to use dimensions obtained\nempirically. Therefore it is well for the amateur to stick closely to\nlines and hints which are given here or which appear in some _up to\ndate_ book on induction coil building.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Diagram of an Induction Coil.]\n\nFor a long time the induction coil was an expensive, inefficient\ninstrument, until wireless telegraphy demanded of it more rigid and\nefficient design and construction. It was the aim of manufacturers to\nproduce the longest possible spark length with a minimum amount of\nsecondary wire. As a result of this demand, wireless coils are now made\nwith a core of large diameter and give heavier and thicker sparks. The\nsecondary in this case is short and uses wire of large cross section in\norder to reduce the resistance and minimize the heating.\n\nNo one part of an induction coil may be developed to its maximum\nefficiency without seriously influencing and lowering the efficiency of\nthe other parts. The following suggestions regarding the construction\nare given that they may prove a useful guide to the amateur coil\nbuilder. The parts will be considered in their natural order of\nconstruction.\n\n*Core.*\u2014Some experimenters not quite familiar with the principles of\nmagnetism reason that if an induction coil were provided with a closed\ncore as the transformer, the efficiency of the coil would be materially\nincreased. But this is not so, for the magnetization and demagnetization\nof the iron cannot take place rapidly enough in a closed core when an\ninterrupted direct current is employed in place of an alternating\ncurrent.\n\nThe core of an induction coil is therefore always straight. For the same\nreason, it is never solid but is made up of a bundle of soft iron wires\nin order that rapid changes in magnetism may take place. The wires are\nalways of as high a permeability\u00b9 as possible so as to create a strong\nmagnetic field. Swedish or Russian iron of a good quality is the best,\nas its hysteresis\u00b2 losses are small. The smaller the diameter of the\nwire the less will be the eddy current losses and heating, but the\npermeability is also rendered less and the core will not be so\neffective, as the amount of iron is thereby decreased and the oxidized\nsurface increased. No. 22 B. S. gauge wire is the best size for the\naverage core.\n\nWires of a good quality may be purchased already cut to various lengths.\nTo buy them in this form will save a great deal of the labor required in\nbuilding a core. If the wires are not quite straight they may be\nstraightened by rolling them, one at a time, between two boards. It is\nbest to reanneal the wires in the following manner. Place them in an\niron pipe and plug the ends of the pipe with clay. Then lay it in a coal\nfire until the whole mass attains a red heat. The fire is then allowed\nto die out gradually with the pipe and wires remaining in the ashes\nuntil cool. When cool remove them from the pipe and rub each one with\nemery paper until bright. After this cleaning, the wires are dipped in\nhot water and dried. They are then dipped in a good quality of varnish\nand allowed to dry again.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Induction Coil Core.]\n\nThe varnish serves to interpose resistance to the eddy currents\ngenerated in the core and renders the losses due to this cause much\nless. A strong paper tube having an internal diameter equal to the\ndiameter of the finished core is made by rolling the paper on a form and\ncementing with shellac. When perfectly dry. the tube is removed and the\nwires tightly packed in it. The following table gives the core\ndimensions for practical coils of different sizes.\n\n*Primary Winding.*\u2014The ratio of the number of primary turns of an\ninduction coil to the number of secondary turns bears no relation to the\nratio of the primary and the secondary currents. It has been found in\npractice that two layers of wire wound tightly on the core constitute\nthe best primary. The primary should always be thoroughly shellacked or\ncovered with insulating varnish. Since there is almost no ventilation in\nthe primary the wire must be large enough to avoid all heating. A table\ncontaining the various sizes of primary wires is given below.\n\nIn large coils, the inductance of the primary causes a \"kick back\" and\nsparks are liable to pass between the adjacent turns. For this reason,\nit is always well to use double cotton covered wire and to further\nthoroughly insulate it by soaking the primary and core in a pan of\nmelted paraffin and allowing them to harden therein. Afterwards the pan\nis slightly warmed to loosen the cake of paraffin and the excess of wax\nremoved by scraping with a blunt instrument so as not to injure the\nwires. Paraffin contracts upon hardening, and the proper method to\nimpregnate a porous substance is to allow it to soak and become set in\nit upon cooling.\n\nA good method of reducing the \"kick back\" and also the size of the\ncondenser shunted across the interrupter is to form the primary of a\nnumber of turns of smaller wire in parallel, the effect being to give a\nconductivity equal to a single wire of large diameter and at the same\ntime to make a more compact winding of the primary on the core. This\nmethod of winding is very desirable in large coils, as it reduces the\ncross section of the primary and allows the secondary to be placed\nnearer the core, where the magnetic field is the strongest.\n\nThe primary winding ought to occupy nearly the whole length of the core,\nsince there is no gain in carrying the end of the core very far beyond\nthe end of the primary, for most of the magnetic lines of force bend at\nthe end of the primary and return without passing through the extreme\nends of the core.\n\n*Insulating Tube.*\u2014The successful operation of an induction coil without\nbreaking down when under strain depends largely upon the insulating tube\nwhich separates the primary and secondary. Hard rubber tubes are perhaps\nthe best. A tube may be easily built up of several layers of 1/2-inch\nsheet hard rubber by steaming it so as to soften it and then wrapping it\naround a form. The tube should fit the primary tightly and be about one\ninch shorter than the core. After the tube is in place it is poured full\nof beeswax and rosin in order to fill all interstices and prevent sparks\ndue to the condenser effect of the windings from jumping from the inside\nof the tube to the primary.\n\n*Secondary.*\u2014A coil used as a wireless telegraph transmitter must have\nwire of large cross section in its secondary so as to obtain a heavy\ndisruptive discharge. Numbers 34 and 32 B. S. are generally used for\nsmall coils and numbers 30 and 28 B. S. for large coils. Silk covered\nwire is the usual practice, but enameled wire is coming into use. Cotton\ncovered wire takes up too much space and has poorer insulating\nqualities.\n\nEnameled wire is insulated by a coating of cellulose acetate, which has\na dielectric strength of about twice that of cotton and takes up much\nless room than silk. There is, then, with enameled wire a great saving\nin space, and a greater number of turns may be placed on the secondary\nwithout increasing its mean distance from the core. The following table\nshows the comparative diameters of silk and enamel covered wires\nsuitable in size for use on the secondaries of induction coils.\n\nIn winding enameled wire it must be taken into consideration that the\ninsulation of enameled wire is rigid and has no give. Consequently, to\nallow for expansion, enameled wire must be more loosely wound than fiber\nor silk covered wire. The occasional insertion of a layer of paper in\nwinding will give room for expansion and at the same time not add\ngreatly to the diameter.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Theoretical and practical form of secondary.]\n\nThe length of the secondary is generally not much more than one-half the\nlength of the core. Coils giving sparks up to 2 inches in length may be\nwound in two sections or in layer windings, but the layer winding is not\nrecommended for coils giving sparks over one inch. It is best in a coil\nof this kind to insert an occasional layer of paper. The paper should be\nwell shellacked or paraffined and be of a good grade of linen. It should\nproject about one-quarter of an inch from the ends of the secondary as\nshown by the sectional drawing in Fig. 28.\n\nThis insertion of paper increases the insulation and renders the\nliability of sparks jumping from layer to layer much less, as is the\ncase when the layers are very long.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Layer Winding for Small Coils.]\n\nThe secondaries of large coils are made up of \"pies\" or \"pancakes\" from\none-eighth to three-eighths of an inch in thickness. The \"pies\" are\nseparated from each other by a triple thickness of blotting paper which\nhas been thoroughly dried and then soaked in melted paraffin. In cutting\nthe blotting paper, much labor may be saved if a metal template of the\nrequired size is first cut from sheet brass and then laid on the\nblotting paper, which is cut by scoring around the edge of the template\nwith a sharp knife.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Section Winder.]\n\nThe \"pies\" are wound in a bobbin or form such as is shown in Fig. 29.\n\nThe disks or flanges are made of sheet brass and mounted on an arbor so\nthat the form may be placed in a lathe or some other contrivance for\nrevolving it. The core is beveled in order to facilitate the removal of\na completed \"pie\" from the winder. The flanges of the winder are clamped\nagainst the core by two nuts placed on either side. The \"pie\" is removed\nby unscrewing one of the nuts and removing one of the flanges.\n\nIn winding silk covered wire it is first passed through a mixture of\nbeeswax and rosin or a bath of melted paraffin. The excess of wax is\nremoved by passing the wire through a slit made in a pad of paper or by\nrubbing against a piece of felt. Fig. 30 shows such a contrivance.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Impregnator for Silk Covered Wire.]\n\nThe wire passes from the reel over an ordinary spool down into the pan\nof paraffin, out of the paraffin, over another spool, and rubs against a\npiece of felt to remove the surplus paraffin. The spools are mounted\nwith a screw and a washer so that they will turn without friction.\n\nThe wire is guided, when winding, by the fingers. If it is wrapped with\na piece of felt and held between the thumb and forefinger it will run\nwithout friction and not cut the fingers. It is necessary that the wire\nshould be closely watched for kinks, etc. which would cause the wire to\nbreak. Oftentimes the wire is broken but is held together by the\ninsulation. Therefore each \"pie\" should be tested for continuity when\ncompleted. This is best accomplished by means of a galvanometer and\nbattery. All imperfect \"pies\" should be rejected, as one of them would\ncause serious trouble if embodied in the coil. In soldering the\nsecondary wires, acid _must not be used_ as it soon corrodes the fine\nwires. Rosin is the best flux for this purpose. When building a small\ncoil with a \"layer\" winding it is absolutely necessary that the wire\nshould be wound on in smooth even layers. In a built-up secondary having\n\"pies\" not greater than 1/4 inch in thickness such great care is not\nnecessary.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Methods of Connecting the Secondary Sections.]\n\nFig. 31 shows the methods of connecting up the pies or pancakes. In _A_,\nthe inside of one section is connected to the outside of the next, and\nso on. The maximum voltage which can exist between the adjacent sections\nin this case is equal to the e.m.f. generated by one \"pie\" and is equal\nthroughout. In _B_, the coils are connected alternately inside and out.\nThe voltage ranges from zero at the points where they are connected, to\na value equal to twice the e.m.f. developed by one section. It would\nseem that there would be a saving in insulation space of one-half in the\nfirst case, but it is not so since the connecting wire passes between\nthe \"pies\" and therefore the insulation must be twice as thick or\nexactly equal to that in the second case. The latter method (Fig. 31 B)\nis the best and most convenient. When the \"pies\" are connected in this\nmanner the current must flow through alternate sections in opposite\ndirections. To accomplish this it is not necessary to wind every\nalternate coil in an opposite direction, but merely to turn them around\nand connect them with the direction of their windings reversed as shown\nby the arrows and the bevels in Fig. 31. The connections between the\nsections must be very carefully soldered.\n\nAfter the secondary is assembled the coil should be placed in a tight\nreceptacle or tank containing melted paraffin. The tank is then\nconnected to an air pump or aspirator and the air exhausted. The\ndiminution of pressure causes any air bubbles in the windings to expand\nand be pumped out. After standing a while, the pressure of the\natmosphere is readmitted and the place of the bubbles will be occupied\nby paraffin which has been forced in under pressure.\n\n*Mounting.*\u2014A coil for wireless work is best mounted as shown in Fig. 32\nand used with an independent interrupter. The coil may then be placed\nunder the operating table or on the wall, out of harm\u2019s way, and the\ninterrupter on the table, where it is handy to the adjustment of the\noperator.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Coil Case.]\n\nThe case is simply a rectangular hardwood box large enough to contain\nthe completed coil. Two binding posts mounted on the side of the box\nconnect with the primary winding and two on the top of the box lead to\nthe secondary terminals. The box is filled with boiled oil or melted\nparaffin and sealed up by screwing on the lid. If desirable, the\nsecondary binding posts may be mounted on the top of a short piece of\nhard rubber rod as illustrated in the drawing.\n\n    \u00b9 Magnetic permeability is the conducting power for lines of\n      magnetic force.\n\n    \u00b2 See _hysteresis_ under Magnetic Detector.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. INTERRUPTERS.\n\n\nWe now come to what is the greatest source of trouble and annoyance in\nan induction coil, namely the interrupter. Too much importance cannot be\nattached to this instrument, for upon it depends largely the\nsatisfactory working of the coil. The operation of an induction coil and\nthe part played by the interrupter were fully explained in the chapter\non induction coils.\n\nAn adjustable interrupter is necessary for large coils, that is, one not\nonly whose speed may be governed, but also the time and duration of the\nbreak.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Simple Interrupter.]\n\nThe rapidity of oscillation of a mechanical interrupter is a very\ndifferent thing from the speed of break. The ideal speed of break is\ninstantaneous. In wireless telegraphy, very faint signals are heard more\ndistinctly in telephone receivers if the rate of interruption at the\nstation sending them is high. The human ear is somewhat more sensitive\nto sounds higher than those ordinarily produced in the telephone\nreceivers of a wireless receptor. This seems to argue the use of a\nhigh-speed interrupter to make and break the current. But the effect on\nthe coil must also be considered.\n\nIn the first place, where a condenser is shunted across the terminals of\nthe secondary as is the case with a wireless transmitter, a high-speed\ninterrupter would be very likely to set up harmful oscillations in the\nsecondary of the coil itself.\n\nSecond, if too fast, the rise and fall of the secondary currents will be\ncaused to run into each other, since the break will occur before the\nprimary current has reached a maximum and the reverse secondary current\nhas died away.\n\nThird, the diameter of the core of a wireless coil is generally much\nlarger than that of the ordinary coil, and if a very rapid interrupter\nis employed there is not time enough to properly magnetize the core\nbefore the current is broken.\n\nFourth, the strength of the losses in the core caused by the eddy\ncurrents and hysteresis are proportional to the interruptions in the\nprimary circuit and therefore a low speed will be the most efficient. A\nrapid interrupter requires a higher voltage and amperage than the same\ninterrupter run at a lower speed.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why it is very desirable to use an atomic\ninterrupter or one so adjustable that the rate of the time and duration\nof the \"make\" and \"break\" may be closely regulated. An ideal interrupter\nis designed to give the longest time possible after contact is\nestablished and before the \"break\" occurs.\n\nIt does not pay to construct an interrupter for an induction coil giving\nsparks up to 2 inches in length. The type of interrupter in use on\nautomobile coils is perfectly well adapted to small coils, and may be\npurchased complete with the platinum points for as low a price as $1.50.\n\nThe mechanical break described below is designed so that various\nadjustments are possible and it may be adapted to almost any coil. Since\nit is independent, it need not be mounted directly on the coil, but may\nbe placed in the position most convenient to the operator for\nadjustment. The interrupter will not operate coils well on an\nelectromotive force above 30 volts, for the excessive voltage causes a\nspark at the contacts when the circuit is broken and prolongs the\ndecadence of the primary current.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Independent Interrupter.]\n\n*Independent Atomic Interrupter.*\u2014Fig. 34 illustrates two views of the\ninterrupter. Current is furnished to the electromagnets by a six volt\nbattery independent of the source supplying the coil. The interrupter is\nset in operation by closing the circuit breaker on the aerial switch.\nWhen the primary circuit of the transmitter is then completed by\npressing the key, the coil will respond immediately because the\ninterrupter is already in vibration.\n\nThe electromagnets (Fig. 35) are a pair of four ohm telegraph sounder\nmagnets. A hole is bored in the center of the top of each magnet core\nand threaded with an 8-32 tap so that the pole pieces may be fastened\nthereto, The shape and dimensions of these projections, which must be\nmade of soft iron, are illustrated in Fig. 35.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Details of Magnets.]\n\nA soft iron yoke _Y_, 2 1/2 x 7/8 x 1/4 inches, connects the bottom of\nthe magnets and supports them in an upright position. An 8-32 machine\nscrew passing upward through the base and yoke holds them firmly. The\nbase is preferably of hard rubber 4 x 3 1/4 x 3/4 inches.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Details of Moving Parts.]\n\nThe moving parts are illustrated in Fig. 36. The main spring, _D_, is a\nstrip of spring steel, 2 1/8 inches long, 1/2 inch wide, and 1/32 inch\nthick. The soft iron armature, _A_, is fastened to the spring by means\nof two small 4-36 machine screws. _M_ is a piece of brass rod, 1 1/2\ninches long, bent in the form of a hook and threaded with a 4-36 die to\nscrew in a similarly threaded hole in the back of the armature _A_. The\nhooked portion of _M_ is fitted with a small piece of hard rubber rod,\n_R_, to insulate it where it comes into contact with the spring, _G_.\nThe spring, _D_, carries a second hook, _E_, riveted to the center of\nthe spring 1 5/8 inches from the lower end. The hook, which is about 3/8\ninch long, passes through a hole in the top of the spring, _F_, and\nengages it so that it is set in operation by the vibratory motion of the\nspring, _D_. The spring, _F_, is 1 3/4 inches long, 5/16 inch wide, and\nir 1/64 inch thick. It carries a platinum rivet 3/4 inch from its lower\nend. The spring, _G_, is 2 1/2 inches long, 5/16 inch wide and 1/64 inch\nthick. A heavy platinum rivet is fastened 2 1/4 inches from the lower\nend. An elongated hole, 1/4 inch long and 3/16 inch wide, permits the\nhook, _M_, to pass through the opening. A 5/32 inch hole, 1 1/4 inches\nfrom the bottom, allows the adjusting screw to pass through and make\ncontact with the platinum rivet on the spring, _F_.\n\nTwo rectangular pieces of brass, _O_, 1 1/4 x 1/2 x 5/16 inches are\nfastened to the base to support the springs.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. Details of Standard and Screws.]\n\nThe standard, _U_, supporting the adjusting thumbscrews is a piece of\n3/8-inch brass, 2 1/2 inches high. It tapers from 1 1/2 inches at the\nbottom to 3/4 inch at the top. A hole 2 1/4 inches from the bottom is\nthreaded with a 10-32 tap to receive the thumbscrew, _B_. A second hole\n1 1/4 inches from the base is threaded with an 8-32 tap to fit the\nadjusting screw, _S_.\n\nBoth of the adjusting thumbscrews carry heavy platinum points. The\nstandard is held upright to the base by means of two machine screws\npassing through the base.\n\nA 3/32 inch brass rod 1 3/4 inches long is threaded to fit a hole in the\ntop of the armature. A sliding weight, _W_, may be clamped in any\nposition on the rod by means of a thumb-screw. Raising or lowering the\nposition of the weight decreases or increases the natural period of\nvibration of the interrupter. Screwing the hook, _M_, in or out so as to\nshorten or lengthen it, decreases or increases the ratio of the make to\nthe break.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Diagram of Connections for an Independent\nInterrupter.]\n\nFig. 38 shows a diagram of the connections of the interrupter. The\nstandard, the thumbscrew, _B_, and the spring, _G_, form part of the\nprimary circuit of the induction coil. The standard, the thumbscrew,\n_S_, the spring, _F_, and the electromagnets are placed in series with a\nsix-volt battery and connected to the circuit breaker on the aerial\nswitch, so that when the switch is thrown in position for transmitting,\nthe interrupter will be set in operation.\n\nA condenser must be shunted across the larger contacts of the\ninterrupter in order to hasten the demagnetization of the core of the\ninduction coil and create a higher e.m.f. in the secondary. The\ncondenser must be suited in size to the induction coil with which the\ninterrupter is to be used and so the following table is appended to\nserve as a guide.\n\nThe condensers are built up of alternate sheets of tin foil and\nparaffined paper. Connections are made to the sheets by means of tin\nfoil strips which project out alternately from opposite sides as in the\nillustration.\n\nThe paper should be about two inches larger each way so as to leave a\none inch margin on all sides of the tin foil.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Construction of a Paper Condenser.]\n\nWhen the alternate sheets of tin foil and paper have all been assembled,\nthe condenser is warmed so as to soften the paraffin. It is then placed\nbetween two flat boards and subjected to great pressure in a letter\npress or a vice. The capacity of a pressed condenser is often several\ntimes that of a condenser of the same dimensions but not pressed.\n\n*Mercury Interrupters.*\u2014The mercury turbine interrupter is one of the\nmost convenient and successful breaks in use. The construction is such\nthat a stream of mercury is made to play against a number of saw shaped\nmetal teeth. A spiral worm terminating in a nozzle at the top is rapidly\nrevolved by an electric motor. The lower end of the tubular worm dips in\na mercury reservoir, so that when the spiral is revolved the mercury is\ncaused by centrifugal action to rise in the tube and be thrown out in\nthe form of a jet at the upper end. When the revolving jet strikes one\nof the metal teeth, the circuit is closed and the current flows from the\nmercury jet into the teeth. When the mercury jet passes between the\nopenings between the teeth, the circuit is interrupted. By raising and\nlowering the saw teeth so that the mercury strikes either the lower or\nupper part of them, the ratio between the make and break may be made\nsmaller or larger. By regulating the speed of the motor driving the jet,\nthe number of interruptions may be varied from 10 to 10,000 per second.\nThe bottom and sides of the mercury reservoir are ribbed to prevent the\nmercury from attaining a rotary motion.\n\nA somewhat simpler and more easily constructed type of mercury\ninterrupter consists of a hard rubber disk having a brass rod running\nthrough from the periphery to the center, where it connects with the\nshaft. The lower edge of the disk dips at an angle in a mercury bath and\nis rapidly revolved by an electric motor. When the rod is under the\nsurface of the mercury, the circuit is made through the mercury to the\nrod. The circuit is broken when the rod is above the surface. The\nmercury is covered with a layer of alcohol, which prevents excessive\nsparking and makes a quicker break. An interrupter of this kind when run\nby a motor of the magnetic attraction type is exceedingly simple.\n\nThe break of any of the mercury type interrupters when properly adjusted\nis much quicker than the hammer spring break and gives thicker sparks.\n\nAfter the mercury has been in use awhile it becomes churned up into\nsmall globules of a black color, but may be easily cleaned and restored\nfor use by shaking up with some strong sulphuric acid. Care must be\ntaken that the mercury is perfectly dry and free from acid before\nreplacing in the interrupter.\n\n*Electrolytic Interrupters.*\u2014Fig. 40 shows a diagram of a Wehnelt\ninterrupter. The cathode or negative electrode is a lead plate immersed\nin dilute sulphuric acid. The anode is a piece of platinum wire placed\nin a porcelain tube and projecting through a small hole in the bottom,\nso that only a very small surface of the wire is exposed to the liquid.\nWhen a strong electrical current is passed through the acid electrolyte,\nthe current is very rapidly interrupted by the formation of gases on the\nsmall platinum electrode. The speed of the interrupter is variable\nthrough great ranges by moving the platinum electrode up or down and\nchanging the amount of surface exposed to the liquid. The only\ndisadvantage of this interrupter is that the electrolyte soon becomes\nheated, and unless the interrupter is provided with a water jacket or\nsome device for cooling, the bubbles of gas do not form freely. A\npotential of at least 40 volts is required to operate a Wehnelt or other\nelectrolytic break.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Wenhelt and Simon Electrolytic Interrupters.]\n\nA Wehnelt interrupter may easily be made by sealing a platinum wire in a\nglass tube. It is well to make several such tubes with the platinum\nprojecting from one-sixteenth to one-quarter of an inch. The different\ntubes will each have a different speed of interruption, and one should\nbe picked out which seems to be most suitable for the coil upon testing.\nConnection to the platinum wire is established by filling the tube with\nmercury and dipping a wire in it.\n\nFig. 40 also shows a diagram of a Simon electrolytic interrupter. It\nconsists of a vessel containing dilute sulphuric acid and divided into\ntwo parts by a thin porcelain diaphragm having a small hole in the\ncenter. A lead electrode dips into each of the divisions. The\ninterruption is caused by exceeding a certain current density in the\nsmall hole at the diaphragm. Upon the passage of the current the liquid\nis so heated that it becomes vaporized. The vapor is a poor conductor to\nlow voltages and so the current is broken. Immediately upon the\ncessation of the current, the vapor condenses and the circuit is\nestablished again. This cycle repeats itself with a speed depending upon\nthe size of the aperture and the amount of current flowing.\n\nA crude form of this type of interrupter may be made by heating the end\nof a test tube in a pin flame, and then blowing on the open end of the\ntube so as to burst the soft glass and form a small hole. Several such\ntest tubes should be prepared having holes varying from 1/32 to 1/8 of\nan inch in diameter. The one which gives the best results upon trial is\nselected for use. A number of holes in a single tube, if not too many or\ntoo large in diameter, increases the efficiency and the speed of\ninterruption. The tube should be immersed in a glass jar containing\ndilute sulphuric acid. One lead electrode is placed inside of the test\ntube and the other outside. It makes no difference which way the current\nflows through this interrupter.\n\nThe Caldwell interrupter is a modification of the Simon type in which\nthe size of the aperture is made adjustable by means of a pointed glass\nrod which may be raised or lowered in the hole and the speed of\ninterruption varied. An interrupter of the test tube type as described\nabove may be modified to this form by locating the hole directly in the\ncenter of the bottom of the tube and inserting in it a hard glass rod\nwhich has been drawn out to a point.\n\nElectrolytic interrupters do not require any condenser connected across\nthe break.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Construction of Electrolytic Interrupters.]\n\nFig. 41 shows in section more substantial forms of both the Wehnelt and\nSimon-Caldwell interrupters. The containers are ordinary 5 x 7 inch\nbattery jars. They are fitted with covers made of two thicknesses, _C_\nand _B_, of 3/4-inch wood. The upper piece, _C_, is 6 inches in\ndiameter, while the under one should fit snugly into the interior of the\njar. The wood must be boiled in paraffin to protect it from the action\nof the acid. A slit is made in the left-hand side of both covers for the\npassage of a lead electrode, _L_, 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick. The\nupper end of the electrode is bent over and fitted with a binding post.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Details of Electrolytic Interrupters.]\n\nThe mechanism for adjusting the interrupters is the same in both cases.\nThe dimensions are indicated in Fig. 42. A brass yoke, _Y_, is mounted\non the cover in the position shown. A 1/2-inch hole is bored through the\nupper part of the yoke and a piece of brass tubing, _S_, 1 inch long\nsoldered in a vertical position in the hole. A 1/4-inch threaded brass\nrod passes through the tube, 5. A groove is milled in A along its entire\nlength and engages a pin in the wall of _S_. The rod is thus enabled to\nslide up and down in the tube but is prevented from revolving. A fiber\nhead, _H_, is fitted with a brass sleeve or bushing in its center. The\nbushing should fit tightly into the fiber head and is threaded to fit\nthe rod, _A_. The electrode may then be carefully raised or lowered by\nrevolving the head. The tube, _V_, for the Simon-Caldwell interrupter is\na hard glass test tube. A 1/8-inch hole is blown in the bottom of the\ntube. A hard glass rod, _G_, is drawn out to a point and fastened to the\nlower end of the rod, _A_, by means of a short length of flexible rubber\ntubing, _R_.\n\nThe tube, N, for the Wehnelt break is made from a piece of hard rubber\ntubing 6 inches long, having a bore of J inch.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Electrolytic Interrupter.]\n\nThe lower end is fitted with a spark plug porcelain. The porcelain must\nfit the tube tightly and not leak. The electrode, _P_, is a piece of\nbrass wire which will just pass through the hole in the porcelain. The\nupper end of the electrode, _P_, is soldered or fastened otherwise to\nthe lower end of the rod, _A_.\n\nA small hole, _h_, should be made in the tubes, _N_ and _V_, above the\nlevel of the electrolyte in the jar. When the interrupter is in\noperation the electrolyte gradually rises in the tubes, and would\ncorrode the lower end of _A_ if it were not able to pass out through the\nvents.\n\nIn the Simon-Caldwell interrupter, a strip of lead passes from the\nbinding post mounted on the foot of the yoke down inside of the test\ntube. The size of the hole in the tube is regulated by revolving the\nfiber head so that the glass pointed rod will be inserted in or\nwithdrawn from the hole.\n\nThe frequency of the interruption will also depend somewhat on the\nconcentration of the acid solution. It is therefore best to start with a\nweak solution and add acid slowly until it is of the proper strength.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. TRANSFORMERS.\n\n\nWhere alternating current is available in commercial wireless telegraph\nstations, the induction coil has been gradually superseded by the more\nmodern transformer for charging the oscillation condenser. Since the\ntransformer is less expensive to construct than an induction coil\ncapable of transmitting the same distance, it is favored by many amateur\nexperimenters. A one quarter kilowatt transformer has a sending range of\nover 50 miles when used with a properly constructed aerial about 80 feet\nhigh. This is probably the size best suited to the average private\ninstallation.\n\nThe secondary of a wireless transformer seldom develops potentials\nexceeding 15,000 to 20,000 volts, while those of an induction coil range\nfrom 1 5,000 to 300,000 volts. However, the strength of the secondary\ncurrent of a transformer is so much greater than that of an induction\ncoil, that more powerful and penetrating waves are developed. For these\nreasons a transformer is always rated by its output in watts or\nkilowatts rather than by the spark length produced at the secondary\nterminals. The spark of a one quarter kilowatt transformer is only 0.25\nto 0.50 of an inch, while the spark of a one half kilowatt transformer\nmay be the same length but still represent more energy.\n\nThere are two distinct types of transformers in use, known as the \"open\"\nand \"closed,\" accordingly whether the core is straight like the core of\nan induction coil or in the form of a hollow rectangle. The open core\ntype is used in the government stations and by the United Wireless\nTelegraph Co. It is the simpler and more easily constructed of the two,\nbut is also less efficient and requires that more material be expended\nto bring it up to a definite rating. In principle it is simply an\ninduction coil operated on alternating current minus the interrupter and\ncondenser. In view of the greater currents employed, the windings must\nbe larger and heavier than those of the induction coil to prevent\nheating.\n\nBefore commencing the construction of a transformer one should read the\nchapter on induction coils and use the same care emphasized there in\nregard to building coils.\n\n*Open Core Transformer.*\u2014The transformer described below will transmit\nfrom 20 to 75 miles and consume about 300 watts on the no volt 60 cycle\nalternating current.\n\nThe core is 16 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. It is built up of\nsoft iron wires in the same manner as if it were the core of an\ninduction coil.\n\nThe primary is composed of two layers of No. 14 double cotton covered B.\nS. gauge magnet wire. The primary is 14 inches long and is wrapped with\na layer of micanite cloth 3/8 inch thick to separate it from the\nsecondary winding.\n\nIt is never advisable to use shellacked cotton cloth as insulation. When\ncotton is dried and shellacked, it is at first a good insulator, but\nsoon becomes capable of absorbing moisture. Shellac carbonizes at a low\ntemperature, and if a transformer or coil having any of this sort of\ninsulation entering into its construction is overheated, the insulation\nis liable to become a conductor. Micanite cloth is the best insulation\nfor transformers. The dielectric strengths of the different forms of\nmicanite are shown by the following table.\n\nThe secondary is wound in ten sections over the micanite insulation.\nEach section is 6 inches in diameter and 1 1/4 inches thick and is wound\nwith No. 30 B. S. single silk covered wire. The sections are separated\nby disks of blotting paper 1/8 inch thick and 7 inches in diameter,\ntreated as described in Chapter IV. The completed transformer should be\nplaced in a box and covered with oil.\n\n*A One Quarter Kilowatt Closed Core Transformer.* The simplest form of a\nclosed core transformer consists of two independent coils of insulated\nwire wound upon an iron ring. When an alternating current is passed\nthrough one of the coils, known as the primary, it generates a magnetic\nflux in the iron core. The lines of force passing through the core\ninduce in the secondary coil an electromotive force the magnitude of\nwhich is in nearly the same ratio to the primary inducing electromotive\nforce as the number of turns of wire in the secondary is to the number\nof turns in the primary. For example, if it is desired to raise the\npotential of the no volt alternating current to 22,000 volts, the number\nof turns in the secondary of the transformer must be at least 200 times\nthe number in the primary.\n\nA circular ring of iron wire presents several theoretical advantages as\na transformer core but it would be difficult to form and afterwards\nplace the windings in position. The core is therefore usually in the\nform of a hollow rectangle, built up of very thin sheets or laminations\nof soft iron carefully insulated from one another by a coat of varnish.\nIf the core were solid or the separate laminations not insulated from\none another, heavy currents, known as eddy currents, would be set up in\nthe iron and cause heating. A considerable loss in the efficiency of the\ntransformer would also result.\n\nOne half of both the secondary and the primary windings of a properly\ndesigned transformer are placed on opposite sides or \"legs\" of the core\nin order to reduce the magnetic leakage and increase the efficiency. The\nonly difficulty involved in such construction is the proper insulation\nof the primary from the secondary, but if careful attention is given to\nthis point no difficulty will be experienced.\n\n*Core.*\u2014The dimensions and method of assembling the core laminations are\nindicated by Fig. 44. Long strips are cut from soft Russian or Swedish\nstovepipe iron. The strips, which are 1 3/4 inches wide are then cut up\ninto short lengths, one half of which are 7 3/4 inches long and the\nother half 4 3/4 inches. Enough are cut to form two piles of each size 1\n3/4 inches high when compressed. The completed core will then form a\nhollow rectangle 9 1/2 x 6 1/2 x 1 3/4 inches.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Assembly and Dimensions of Core.]\n\nThe strips must be dipped in some good insulating varnish such as P. &\nB. compound and thoroughly dried before they are assembled. Both \"legs\"\n(the longest sides) are laid on a table with the alternate ends\noverlapping as shown by _A_ and _B_ in Fig. 44. After the short pieces\n_C_ and _D_ have been slipped between the overlapping ends the whole\ncore is squared up. The strips _D_ are then carefully removed and one\nend of the core thus left open until all the windings are in place.\nThree or four layers of well varnished linen cloth are wound tightly\nover the \"legs\" preparatory to winding on the primary.\n\n*Primary.*\u2014Four fiber heads, _H_, 4 3/4 inches square, 1/2 inch thick\nand having a square hole 1 7/8 x 1 7/8 inches cut in the center are\nrequired. One of the fiber heads is placed on each end of the assembled\n\"leg\" as shown in Fig. 48.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. Fiber Head and Separator.]\n\nThe primary winding is wound in six layers, 4 1/2 inches long, three\nlayers on each \"leg.\" About three pounds of No. 16 B. S. gauge double\ncotton covered magnet wire are required for the winding. The terminals\nof the two halves of the primary are led through the fiber heads at the\nsame end of the transformer. The windings are not to be carried close up\nto the fiber heads but begin and end about 1/4 inch from them, so that\nthe remaining space may be filled by winding in a strip of micanite\ncloth 1/4 inch wide. The primary and secondary windings are separated by\na strip of micanite cloth 5 inches wide, wound over both of the primary\nwindings close up to the heads until a layer 1/2 inch thick is formed.\n\n*Secondary.*\u2014The form on which the secondary sections are wound is\nillustrated in Fig. 46. All the parts are cut out of wood except the\nshaft and are made of the dimensions indicated. If the center of the\nform is slightly tapered it will greatly facilitate the removal of the\ncompleted sections. Sixteen sections are required. When removed from the\nwinder they will be in the form of hollow squares 4 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 7/16\ninches.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Section Form.]\n\nAbout ten pounds of No. 34 B. S. gauge silk covered wire are required to\nwind the sections. Cotton covered wire must not be used to avoid\nexpense, because with it a sufficient number of secondary turns cannot\nbe secured to bring the secondary current up to the proper voltage. By\nobserving explicitly the instructions and precautions given below no\ntrouble will be experienced in handling enameled wire and forming the\nsections. The form should be placed in a lathe chuck or some other\nmachine which is convenient and whereby the form may be rapidly revolved\nunder the control of the operator.\n\nSaw slots are cut in the wooden flanges and the center of the form as\nshown in the illustration so that silk threads may be passed under and\naround the completed section and tied so that a possible \"cave in\" of\nthe wire is prevented. After tying up the section should be removed from\nthe form by unscrewing the nut and taking off the flange.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. Methods of Connecting Sections.]\n\nWhen winding the wire it must be very carefully watched for loops or\nkinks and only be laid on in even layers. It must also be borne in mind\nthat enameled wire cannot be as tightly wound as fiber covered wire for\nreasons heretofore explained. In case the wire becomes broken, it must\nbe smoothly spliced and soldered. Do not under any consideration use\nacid as a flux or heat the wire with a flame. Acid will corrode the fine\nwire, and the flame will badly oxidize or melt it. Use a short piece of\nNo. 8 B. S. gauge tinned copper wire set in a small file handle as a\nsoldering iron, and rosin as a flux. Paraffin some silk binding tape\nsuch as dressmakers use and wrap the joint with a small piece. The\nsections as they are removed from the winder must be taped and then\ncarefully marked with an arrow which points in the direction of the\nwinding.\n\nFig. 47 illustrates the two methods of connecting up the sections. It\nwill be noticed in the second method that the arrow denoting the\ndirection of winding points down on every alternate section. This does\nnot indicate necessarily that every alternate section is wound in an\nopposite direction from the other, but that they have merely been turned\naround so that the arrows come on a reverse side of the core and point\nin an opposite direction. This precaution must be taken in order that\nthe current will flow through all the sections, and is made necessary\nbecause the inside terminal of one section is connected to the inside\nterminal of the adjacent section and the outside terminal of that\nsection is connected to the outside terminal of the next adjacent\nsection. The first method, _A_, illustrated in Fig. 44, is less\ncomplicated and does not require this reversal, but for various reasons\nis not to be recommended in place of _B_.\n\nEight of the completed and taped sections are placed on each \"leg\" of\nthe transformer, with one of the fiber separators between each pair as\nin Figs. 48 and 49. When each \"leg\" has been completely assembled,\nsolder all the secondary terminals together so as to connect as in Fig.\n47.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Assembly of Leg.]\n\nThen place the remaining fiber head, _S_, on each of the \"legs\" and\nfinish assembling the core by slipping in the end strips _D_.\n\nSquare the core up perfectly true and fasten by four fiber strips _M_,\nFig. 49, 9 3/4 inches long, 1 3/4 inches wide and 1/2-inch thick. The\nstrips are placed in the position shown in Fig. 46 and a hole _P_ bored\nin the end of each. Four 1/4-inch bolts, two of which are 3 inches long\nand two 3 1/2 inches, pass through the holes in the strips, so that when\nthe nuts are screwed on the core is clamped firmly. The two longer bolts\nare placed at the same end of the transformer.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. Transformer with One Secondary removed.]\n\nThe terminals of the primary lead out to four binding posts mounted on\nthe fiber strips. The pillars which support the secondary binding posts\nare fiber rods, 1 inch in diameter and 2 inches long. The lower end of\neach is bored and tapped to fit the upper ends of the longer bolts which\nclamp the fiber strips together. An insulating shield must be placed\nbetween the two secondary windings to prevent sparks from jumping\nacross. A piece of fiber 5 x 5 x 1/8 inches will serve nicely for this\npurpose. If the primary windings are placed in series the transformer\nwill consume about 300 watts. When the transformer is placed in a box\nand the box filled with some boiled amber petroleum, the windings may be\nconnected in parallel and the transformer will consume about 500 watts.\nIt will then transmit over 100 miles providing the aerial is at least\n100 feet high.\n\nThe wiring connections are diagramed in Fig. 50. A variable inductance\nor reactance coil is connected in series with the primary circuit to\nsteady the current, as explained in the paragraph under reactance. A\nreactance suitable for this transformer may be constructed by winding\ntwo layers of No. 12 B. S. gauge cotton covered wire, six inches long,\naround a hollow wooden tube made of cigar box wood. The core is built up\nof soft sheet iron to form a rectangle 8 x 1 3/4 x 1 3/4 inches which\nwill just slide in and out of the tube. The windings should be about six\ninches long.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Wiring Diagram.]\n\nFive half-gallon Leyden jars form about the right capacity for the\nsecondary of the transformer when the windings are in series. Twice that\nnumber must be used when the windings are in parallel.\n\nThe secondary sections must always be kept in series, as otherwise the\nvoltage would not be high enough to properly charge the condenser.\n\n\n\nConstruction of a 2-K.W. Transformer.\n\n\n*Core.*\u2014Strips 2 1/2 inches wide are cut from soft sheet iron. One half\nof them should be 11 1/2 inches long and the other half 6 1/2 inches.\nEnough are cut to make two piles of each size 2 1/2 inches high. Both\nsides (the longest strips) of the core are built up with the ends\noverlapping as in Fig. 41.\n\nThe ends (the short pieces) are then slipped between the overlapping\nends of the long strips and the whole core squared up. The completed\ncore should have a cross section of 2 1/2 inches square and form a\nhollow rectangle 8 x 14 inches. The strips of iron must be dipped in P.\n& B. insulating varnish and dried before they are assembled.\n\n*Primary.*\u2014Four fiber heads 6 inches square, 1/2 inch thick and having a\nhole 2 1/2 inches square are made. One of these is placed on the core\nlegs as shown by Fig. 48. Two or three layers of well varnished linen\nare wound over the core preparatory to winding the primary. Room must be\nleft for the other head to be placed on the opposite end after the\nwindings are all in place. The primary consists of 100 double turns of\nNo. 12 B. S. gauge double cotton covered magnet wire. Fifty of the\ndouble turns are wound on each leg. The four terminals of the primary\nare led out through the fiber heads. Care should be taken to distinguish\nthem from each other so that they may be identified when the transformer\nis completed. The primary is then wound with a strip of micanite or\nempire cloth 8 inches wide until it measures 4 inches square over all.\n\n*Secondary.*\u2014The secondary coils, which are eight in number, are wound\non a form 4 inches square and 1 1/2 inches between the flanges. The\nconstruction of the form is similar to that shown in Fig. 46 but is\nlarger. The slots are also necessary here so that the completed section\nmay be tied up.\n\nAbout ten pounds of No. 30 B. S. gauge single silk covered wire are\nrequired to wind the secondary. The sections are wound in smooth even\nlayers until they are six inches in outside diameter. They are then tied\nup and removed from the winder. The sections are separated by sheets of\nfiber 6 1/2 inches square on the outside, 1/2 inch thick, having a hole\n4 inches square cut in the center. The sections are all connected in\nseries and the terminals soldered to strips of copper.\n\nAfter the secondary coils are all in place and connected, the fiber head\nis slipped on the end of the leg. Then the short lengths of the core,\nwhich had been pulled out again after squaring the core up, are slipped\ninto place. The core is squared up again and fastened together by boring\na 3/8-inch hole completely through the core at each corner. Two strips\nof fiber 12 x 2 1/2 x 1/2 inches are bored with corresponding holes in\ntheir ends. These strips are placed at the end of the transformer, on\ntop of the core, and 1/4-inch bolts passed through the holes in the\nfiber and the core. The bolts are wrapped with micanite cloth where they\npass through the core, and an insulating washer is placed under the\nnuts, so that the iron core laminations are not electrically connected.\nThe nuts are tightened until the core is held firmly together.\n\nThe fiber strips also serve as insulated supports for the binding posts.\nThe copper terminals of the secondary lead to two binding posts mounted\non two fiber or hard rubber pillars 1 inch diameter and 4 inches high.\nThe rods are arranged as explained in the section under the heading of a\n1/4-K.W. transformer.\n\nThe transformer is designed for use on a 60-cycle 110-volt current. It\nmay be used on 220 volts if the two primary coils are connected in\nseries. When the primaries are in series, and the transformer is used on\nthe 110-volt current, it will deliver a voltage of about 12,000 at the\nsecondary. With either primary alone the voltage will be about 12,000,\nand with both in parallel about 25,000. It will then deliver a very\nheavy current at the secondary and draw from the line about 20 amperes\nin the primary. If used with a proper tuning helix, condenser and\naerial, the transformer is capable of sending about 300 miles under\nfavorable conditions.\n\nIf the transformer is to be used for long periods at a time, it is best\nto place it in a tight wooden box 18 inches square and 12 inches deep.\nThe box is then filled with boiled linseed oil or amber petroleum.\n\nA rheostat or impedance and reactance coil should be placed in series\nwith the transformer to regulate the current and also to prevent arcing\nacross the spark gap.\n\n*Reactance.*\u2014In Chapter I, the lag and lead of a circuit were explained\nin connection with tuning. This is a property of every alternating\ncircuit and is brought to our notice again in the transformer which\ncharges the condenser. The current developed by a transformer is a\nleading current, since the instantaneous values of the current do not\ncorrespond to the proportionate values of the voltage supplying the\ncurrent. In order to force the current values of the charging current to\ncorrespond with the voltage it is necessary to produce a \"lag.\" This is\naccomplished by means of an adjustable reactance in series with the\nprimary of the transformer.\n\nA reactance or inductance suitable for the 2-K.W. transformer may be\nmade by building up a coil in the same manner as described under the\nheading of the J-K.W. transformer. The reactance will have to be\nsomewhat larger on account of the heavier currents. The core is built up\nof sheet iron to measure 2 1/2 x 2 1/2 x 10 inches when completed. The\ncoil is wound around a wooden form and is composed of about 100 turns of\nNo. 8 B. S. gauge double cotton covered magnet wire. By varying the\namount of core inserted in the hollow coil the energy may be adjusted as\ndesired.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. Clapp-Eastham 1/4-K.W. Transformer.]\n\nFig. 51 illustrates the 1/4-K.W. transformer manufactured by the\nClapp-Eastham Company. The core is so constructed that a small metal\ntongue of soft iron projects from one side of the core towards the\nopposite side between the windings, but is separated from the opposite\nside by a small air gap. Several objects are accomplished by this\ntongue, which gives rise to magnetic leakage; the inductance of the\nprimary is increased thereby to such an extent that the transformer is\nself-controlling, so that it may be connected directly to the source of\nalternating current supply of ordinary commercial frequencies and\npotential, and the current flowing in this circuit be regulated by\nvarying the number of turns in the primary coil. As this magnetic\nleakage gives rise to a loose coupling effect, the primary and secondary\ncircuits may be brought into resonance by placing a suitable capacity\nacross the secondary terminals. This condition of resonance brings the\npower factor to a materially higher percentage. While the power factor\nof the open or closed core transformer is seldom above 50%, this type of\ntransformer has a power factor of 80 to 90% when used with a suitable\ncondenser.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. United Wireless Motor-Generator set for\nsupplying Alternating Current to the Transformer.]\n\nAnother point of considerable advantage is the almost entire freedom\nfrom arcing at the spark gap when this type of transformer is used. The\nspark gap is connected directly across the secondary terminals of the\ntransformer and the condenser. The primary turns of the helix and the\nspark gap are connected in series. When the transformer is in operation,\nthis condenser being across the secondary, the transformer is in\nresonance and the condenser is charged to such a point that it will jump\nthe spark gap. At the instant that the spark passes, the secondary of\nthe transformer is practically short circuited through the spark gap. As\nthis circuit is now closed and the condenser out of circuit, the\nsecondary circuit of the transformer is no longer in resonance and the\nenergy immediately drops off, destroying at once the tendency for an arc\nto form. As soon as the spark has passed, the condenser of course comes\nin to play and the condition of resonance being reestablished the same\nprocess is repeated. The Clapp-Eastham Company have made application for\na patent on any transformer employing this or any similar construction\nfor use in charging a condenser.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. OSCILLATION CONDENSERS AND LEYDEN JARS.\n\n\nA condenser consists of two conducting surfaces separated by an\ninsulator or dielectric. Fig. 53 shows a diagram of a simple condenser\nin which _A_ and _B_ are two tinfoil sheets separated by a sheet of\nglass, _C_.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. Simple Condenser.]\n\nIf _A_ is connected by means of a wire to a static machine a positive\ncharge will collect on the glass at _A_ and induce a negative charge at\n_B_, so that if _A_ and _B_ are connected to a small spark gap the\ncharge will leap the gap in the form of a spark.\n\nWhen a condenser discharges through a coil of wire, the discharge\nconsists of a large number of exceedingly rapid oscillations or\nsurgings. The first passage of current more than empties the condenser\nand it becomes charged in the opposite direction, that is, the\nconducting coatings change their polarity. A reverse discharge then\noccurs which also oversteps itself and the oscillations thus go on but\nbecome rapidly weaker until they die completely. The time consumed in\nthe discharge may have been only a fraction of a second, but during that\nshort period the current perhaps oscillated several thousand times.\n\nIf a condenser is discharged through a conductor of high resistance the\ndischarge passes out slowly, and dies away gradually in one direction\nwithout oscillating. One of the fundamental equations of wireless\ntelegraphy is therefore that there will be oscillations in a circuit if\nthe resistance in ohms is not greater than the square root of four times\nthe inductance in henries divided by the capacity of the condenser in\nmicrofarads.\n\nThe capacity or the ability of a condenser to store electricity depends\nupon the area and form of the conducting surfaces, the thickness of the\ndielectric between them, and a factor known as the specific inductive\ncapacity of the dielectric. The unit of capacity is called the farad and\nis defined as the condenser which would be raised to a potential of one\nvolt by a charge of one ampere flowing for one second. A condenser of\nsuch a capacity is, because of its enormous size, impractical to\nconstruct, and the unit ordinarily used is therefore the microfarad, or\none millionth of a farad.\n\nCapacity may be calculated from the following formula:\n\nCapacity equals K(A/D),\n\nwhere _K_ equals a constant depending upon the specific inductive\ncapacity of the dielectric, _A_ the total area of tinfoil and _D_ the\nthickness of the dielectric.\n\n*Leyden Jars.*\u2014Transmitting condensers in a wireless telegraph station\nusually take the convenient form of a jar, coated inside and out with\ntinfoil and known as a Leyden jar.\n\nThe jars should be of good Bohemian or Jena hard glass and coated with\ntinfoil only for about three-quarters of their height, as otherwise the\ndischarge is liable to pass over the top. The tinfoil must be thick to\navoid blistering, and is stuck to the glass with shellac varnish. The\nblistering of Leyden jars is a serious fault, for when this condition\nexists, the capacity is thereby altered to such an extent that the\nperiod of the closed circuit may be sufficiently altered to throw the\nsystem out of tune and decrease the radiation of energy.\n\nConsiderable expense may be saved if the glass jars are purchased and\ncoated by the amateur. The best jars are those imported from Germany,\nwhich have wide mouths so that they may be easily coated inside with\ntinfoil.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. Leyden Jar.]\n\nThe jars must be _thoroughly_ cleaned and dried before they are coated.\nGive the inside a thorough brushing over with shellac varnish, and\nbefore it is dry, carefully insert the tinfoil and press it smoothly\nagainst the glass. The outside of the jar is treated and coated in the\nsame manner. The inside and outside of the bottom are also coated by\ncutting the tinfoil in circular pieces and shellacking them on.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. \"Aerial Switch.\"]\n\nThe whole upper part of the jar is given one or two coats of shellac in\norder to prevent the collection of moisture and brush discharging. A\nwooden plug fitted in the top of the jar supports a brass rod,\nterminating at the lower end in a chain or spiral spring which connects\nwith the inner coating. When trouble is experienced because of an\nimperfect contact between the coating and the chain or rod, a layer of\nbrass filings an inch or two deep placed in the bottom of the jar will\nremedy the difficulty. The upper end of the rod usually terminates in a\nsmall brass ball or a binding post.\n\nThe wooden plug or cover is dried in an oven to expel all moisture and\nthen boiled in paraffin.\n\nSmall Leyden jars may be very conveniently made from six-inch test tubes\nand mounted in a rack so that the capacity of the condenser will be\nadjustable by removing one or more of the tubes. An ordinary test tube\nrack such as is used in chemical laboratories serves very well for this\npurpose. The tubes should be connected in parallel, that is, all the\noutside coatings together and all the inside coatings together.\n\nFigs. 55 and 56 illustrate condensers of this type which are on the\nmarket. The tubes are all separately removable so that the capacity may\nbe adjusted.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. Amco Oscillation Condenser.]\n\n*Glass Plate Condensers.*\u2014Glass plate condensers offer several\nadvantages over Leyden jars and are coming into wide use. They are not\nso bulky or expensive and, above all, do not blister.\n\nPlate condensers are often placed in a rack and made adjustable by means\nof movable contacts. Much the better plan is to place the plates in oil,\nas this eliminates all corona or brush discharges and much sharper\ntuning is rendered possible. The container is usually a tight wooden box\nfilled with oil or paraffin after the plates are in place.\n\nIt is impossible to state the size of condenser suitable for induction\ncoils of a given power or spark length, because many factors such as\ninductance, length of aerial, etc., which differ in various stations,\ninfluence the capacity. A condenser of convenient size suitable for\ncoils or small transformers consuming from 250 to 300 watts is that\ndescribed below. It is about the proper size for the small open core and\n1/4-K.W. closed core transformers, described in the last chapter.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Clapp-Eastham Oscillation Condenser.]\n\nThe glass plates may be secured by removing the emulsion from old 8 x 10\ninch photograph plates. Hot water will soften the gelatin on the plates\nso that it may be very easily scraped off. Twenty-four plates of this\nsize are required. The tinfoil is cut 8 x 8 inches, so that an inch\nmargin is left on all sides. The alternate sheets are connected together\nby heavy tinfoil or thin copper foil strips. The condenser should be\nplaced in a convenient sized wooden box and poured full of paraffin.\n\nThe plate condenser shown in Fig. 57 is of .02 microfarad capacity. The\ncondenser is mounted in a plain wooden box with several binding posts\nbrought out, so that the capacity may be varied by connecting in various\nsections. The condenser is manufactured and designed by the\nClapp-Eastham Company for use with the transformer illustrated in Fig.\n51.\n\nIt is very necessary to have the transmitting condenser adjustable so\nthat its capacity may be varied, for the proper value depends upon the\nwave length, spark frequency, power and persistency of the wave train.\n\nWhen the condenser capacity is too small the spark will be somewhat\nflaming like an arc, and the potential to which the aerial is charged\nwill be low. If too much capacity is used the spark will be very\nirregular and intermittent.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Methods of Varying Capacity.]\n\nFig. 58 shows condensers connected in series and in parallel and a\ncombination of the two. Two condensers of equal capacity connected in\nparallel have twice the capacity of one, while in series they will have\nonly one-half the capacity of either. This may be otherwise stated as\nthe capacity in series is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the\nreciprocals of their capacities separately. By this means of connecting\neither in series or in parallel almost any desired adjustment of\ncapacity may be brought about.\n\nOftentimes a high voltage may be divided between two condensers by\nplacing them in series and thus using them safely on a voltage which\nwould rupture either one alone. For example, two condensers built for\n20,000 volts and to be used on 30,000 volts could be made to perform\nthis duty safely and only undergo a potential of 15,000 volts, which is\na large margin of safety.\n\nIt is obvious that if the capacity of the circuit were to remain\nconstant, four condensers connected up in series-parallel would be\nnecessary.\n\nIn case of several Ley den jars or condensers connected up in a\ntransmitting circuit, the leads or conducting wires connecting the\nvarious units should all be of as nearly the same length as it is\npossible to have them.\n\nThe resistance of metallic conductors to high frequency currents is\nseveral times their normal resistance to constant currents. The larger\nthe diameter of the wire the greater is this ratio. This increase of\nresistance is due to the fact that the high frequency currents permeate\nwires only a very short distance. In the case of copper, the depth is\nonly about one three-hundredth of an inch and with other metals much\nless. Therefore it is advisable to use as leads and conductors of large\ncondensers, stranded wires or flat ribbons of sheet copper in order to\npresent more surface and offer less resistance than solid conductors of\nan equal cross sectional area.\n\nIron must never be used, as its resistance to these currents is over\nfifty times that of copper.\n\nAfter connections are once established between the jars or the condenser\nunits, they cannot be altered nor the capacity changed without re tuning\nthe circuits afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. SPARK GAPS OR OSCILLATORS.\n\n\nThe oscillator or spark gap is one of the most important yet often the\nmost poorly adjusted part of a wireless station.\n\nTo obtain a good oscillatory discharge with little damping it is\nnecessary that the resistance of the circuit should be kept low, and\nsince the greatest part of the resistance is in the spark gap it would\nappear as if this must be very short. While there are reasons for\nkeeping it short there are on the other hand very good reasons why it\nshould not be made too short, and the proper length should be a sort of\ncompromise to be determined by experiment.\n\nIf the gap is too short, the discharge will form an arc and the only\noscillations taking place will be those corresponding to the frequency\nof the charging current. Power consumption is also in favor of a long\ngap, since it causes the induction coil or transformer to draw less\ncurrent from the line. Another argument in favor of a long gap is the\nfact that the condenser is charged to a higher voltage and more energy\nstored up, which makes a greater distance of transmission possible. But\nas stated above (and there always is a tendency for the amateur operator\nto open out his gap as long as the sparks will continue to jump\nsteadily) the discharge will not oscillate but will merely set up a\nunidirectional current.\n\nThere exists a proper gap length for a given circuit which will cause\nthat circuit to emit a maximum amount of energy and which may be\ndetermined accurately only by means of a hot-wire ammeter placed in the\naerial circuit. The proper gap length is then indicated by the maximum\ndeflection of the meter.\n\nThe correct adjustment of the gap may be approximated by the experienced\noperator. If too short, the spark will be hissing and flaming and is in\nextreme cases red or yellow colored. It should be lengthened out until\nit is thick and white and a slight increase in sound is noted. The spark\nshould not be, as commonly thought, stringy and crackling.\n\nArcing is often caused by insufficient condenser capacity in the\ncircuit. But if the capacity is increased to remedy the arcing, the gap\nlength should also be increased or otherwise the potential of the\ncondenser may not be sufficiently raised to permit a disruptive\ndischarge to take place.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. Spark Gaps.]\n\nThe best spark gap for use with a small untuned transmitter, making use\nof neither tuning helix nor condenser, is shown at the left in Fig. 59.\nIt consists of two brass balls supported on suitable double binding\nposts. The balls tend to thicken the spark and make it more disruptive\nthan if it passed between rods or points. The balls also increase the\npotential required to leap the gap without increasing its length and\npermit the aerial to become more highly charged before a discharge takes\nplace. For this reason the balls or knobs must always be kept free from\nsmall rough spots or points by frequent polishing.\n\nSilver has some peculiar property which makes it the most efficient\nmaterial for a spark gap, but its cost prohibits its use and so brass or\nzinc, which are next in order, is generally used.\n\nThe type of gap illustrated at the right in Fig. 59 is very convenient\nand efficient for small tuned transmitters employing coils of low power.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Spark Gap.]\n\nThe zinc tips are pieces of 3/8-inch zinc battery rod 3/4 inch long.\nThey are bored and threaded to fit a pair of brass rods 1/8 inch\ndiameter and 2 1/2 inches long. The rods are supported by two double\nbinding posts and are fitted with two pieces of hard rubber rod 1/2 inch\ndiameter and 1 inch long to serve as handles. If desirable one of the\nrods and binding posts may be threaded so that the adjustment of the gap\ncan be accomplished by revolving the handle and screwing the gap in or\nout.\n\nA gap of the size and type just described would not be suitable in\nconnection with a large transformer or an induction coil. The heavy\ndischarge of such powerful instruments would very rapidly heat the small\nbrass parts and corrode or even melt the zinc. The spark gap such as is\nshown in Fig. 59 may be used with a very large coil or the two kilowatt\ntransformer if the same proportions are kept and it is made one-half\nagain as large. Using the dimensions shown in the figure, the spark gap\nis suited to either the open core or the 1/4 and 1/2 kilowatt\ntransformers.\n\nTwo pieces of hard rubber rod, 3/4 inch diameter and 2 inches long serve\nas the standards. Three grooves 1/8 inch wide, 1/8 inch deep and 1/8\ninch apart better the appearance and reduce the liability of leakage but\nare not necessary. Two holes 2 inches apart are bored in _S_, a strip of\nbrass 3 x 3/4 x 1/4 inches. Two screws pass through these holes into the\nrubber standards _BB_ and hold _S_ firmly in position. The end of _S_ is\nbent down at right angles and bored to receive a binding post. A hole is\nbored in _S_ halfway between the standards and tapped to receive a\nthreaded brass rod 2 inches long and 1/4 inch diameter. The lower ends\nof the hard rubber standards are each bored and tapped to receive a\nscrew which fastens them to the base. The electrodes are zinc or brass\ncylinders 3/4 inch diameter and 5/8 inch long. The upper electrode is\nadjustable by means of a knurled hard rubber head 2 inches diameter and\n1/2 inch thick. The lower one is fastened to a brass plate 2 inches\nlong, 1 inch wide and 1/8 inch thick. One end of the plate is fitted\nwith a binding post. The base is a piece of hard rubber 5 1/2 x 3 inches\nx 3/4 inch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. TRANSMITTING HELIXES.\n\n\nThe transmitting helix or tuning coil supplies the greater part of the\ninductance which is so necessary for the production of electrical\noscillations in the transmitting circuit. It consists merely of a few\nturns of heavy copper or brass wire wound in a helix around a form. Two\nor more movable contacts permit various amounts of the inductance to be\ninserted in the open or closed circuits.\n\nThe tuning helixes described in this chapter are offered principally to\nserve as guides. They have been designed as carefully as possible to\nsuit the transmitters for which they are recommended.\n\nThere are factors, such as the aerial, etc., which vary greatly in\nstations of the same rated power and make it best to determine the\nlength of the helix by actual experiment.\n\nA certain amount of inductance is necessary in the closed circuit for\nthe production of electrical oscillations and to transfer energy to the\nopen circuit. Inductance beyond that necessary to receive energy from\nthe closed circuit lessens the radiation and makes it necessary to\nincrease the period of the open circuit by adding wires to the aerial.\n\nThe open and closed circuits of a tuning helix constitute an oscillation\ntransformer, and the two circuits if they are very close together or\nintertwined are said to be _closely coupled_. When separated or far\napart they are _loosely coupled_.\n\n*Closely Coupled Helix.*\u2014Fig. 61 illustrates a closely coupled tuning\nhelix, suitable for ordinary induction coils giving sparks up to 3 or 4\ninches in length.\n\nThe heads of the helix are circular pieces of hard wood 1 inch thick and\n12 inches in diameter. Six rectangular notches are made at equal\ndistances along the edges of the heads. Six uprights 3/4 x 1/2 inch and\n8 3/4 inches long are fastened in the notches with small round headed\nbrass screws so that the heads are separated a distance of 6 3/4 inches.\nGrooves are cut in the outside face of each of the uprights at a\ndistance of 7/8 inch apart. The wire forming the helix is 1/4 inch\nbrass. Brass wire is springy and retains its shape better than copper.\nAbout twenty-two feet will be required. The wire is wound in the grooves\nin the uprights and held in place by a few double pointed tacks placed\njudiciously. The adjacent turns of wire will then have a separation of\nabout 5/8 inch.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Closely Coupled Helix.]\n\nThe helix is raised above the level of the operating bench or table by\nthree small feet fastened to the under head, 120 degrees apart.\n\n[Illustration: *Plate III. Transmitting Circuits.*]\n\nIf it is desired to use this helix with the one quarter K.W.\ntransformer, the diameter of the wire should be increased to 5/16 inch.\nThe two K.W. transformer will require seven turns of 1/2-inch hard drawn\nbrass wire two feet in diameter.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Prague Transmitting Helix.]\n\nWhen setting up a transmitting station, it is a good plan to coil up a\nlong piece of the wire to be used on the helix around a rough form. The\nadjacent turns should be the same distance apart as they are to be on\nthe finished instrument. Tune up the station with this improvised helix\nand ascertain the amount of inductance required. It is then easy to\ndesign a helix containing the proper amount of wire. Four or five feet\nextra should be included to allow plenty of range in case it is ever\nnecessary to make any changes in the aerial or condenser.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Closely Coupled Tuning Circuit.]\n\nPlate III illustrates the transmitting circuits of the various\ncommercial systems. The circuit used will determine the number of\nbinding posts and movable clips necessary. Fig. 63 gives the diagram of\na very good circuit.\n\n*Loosely Coupled Helix*. The heads of the primary coil of the loosely\ncoupled helix illustrated in Fig. 64 are circular pieces of hard wood 1\ninch thick and 18 inches in diameter. Six uprights 3/4 x 1/2 inch and 11\ninches long are set into notches in the upper head and fastened to the\nbase so that the space between the heads for winding the wire is 10\ninches.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. Loosely Coupled Transmitting Helix and Contact\nClip.]\n\nA square wooden pillar 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 inches and 32 inches long passes\nthrough a square hole 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 inches in the center of the heads\nand projects 20 inches above the upper one. The heads of the secondary\ncoil are each 12 inches in diameter. The distance between them is also\n12 inches. A square hole 1 1/2 inches x 1 1/2 inches in the center of\neach of the heads permits the whole secondary coil to slide up and down\non the pillar. Several 1/4 inch holes bored 1 inch apart in the pillar\nadmit a small peg of the same diameter. The coupling between the two\ncoils is varied by changing the height of _S_ above _P_ and inserting\nthe peg to hold the upper coil in position.\n\nThe primary winding of the transformer should consist of about 20 turns\n15 inches in diameter, and may range in size of wire from No. 2 to No. 8\nB. S. gauge.\n\nThe secondary is 10 inches in diameter and will require about 40 turns\nof No. 10 to No. 16 B. S. gauge.\n\nThe largest sizes of wire are for the one-quarter and one-half K.W.\ntransformers while the smaller sizes are best suited to small induction\ncoils.\n\nFig. 64 also illustrates a clip for making connections to the turns of\nthe helix. The handle is a piece of hard rubber rod 2 1/2 inches long\nand 5/8 inch in diameter. A saw slot 1 inch deep is cut down the center\nof one end. Two strips of spring brass 2 inches long, 5/8 inch wide and\n3/64 inch thick are bent as shown in the illustration. The straight ends\nare slipped in the slot in the handle and clamped together by boring a\nhole and passing a machine screw through. The upper end may be fitted\nwith a nut or a binding post to facilitate connection. Flexible copper\nribbons or stranded wire should be the only conductor used for the\ntuning leads.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Loosely Coupled Transmitting Circuit.]\n\n*Tuning a Transmitter.*\u2014Fig. 62 shows a complete wiring diagram of a\ntransmitter with a hot wire ammeter inserted in the aerial circuit.\n\nTo tune such a transmitter place both contacts _A_ and _B_ together on a\nturn of wire near the center of the helix. Set the transmitter in\noperation by pressing the key and move both contacts together along the\nvarious turns of wire until the meter shows a maximum reading. Then vary\n_B_ alone until the reading is still higher. Shifting _A_ varies the\ninductance in the closed circuit and _B_ that of the open circuit.\n\nFig. 65 illustrates the circuit of a loosely coupled transmitter. To\ntune such a circuit it is necessary to connect a small needle spark gap\nbetween the aerial and the ground.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. United Wireless Helix, Spark Gap and Condenser.]\n\nA suitable spark gap for this purpose may be made of two darning needles\nmounted in double binding posts.\n\nSet the clips, _A_ and _B_, at the center turns of their respective\ncoils. Press the key to operate the transmitter and adjust the clip,\n_A_, until the best spark is obtained in the small needle gap. Then\nadjust _B_ until the spark is still better.\n\nIf several wires seem to give the same results, move the secondary a\nlittle further away from the primary and try again. After securing the\nbest spark it is possible to obtain, remove the needle gap, which is\nonly used in testing. The hot wire ammeter should then be placed in\nseries with the aerial. By slowly and carefully adjusting the clips and\nvarying the coupling, the hot wire ammeter will indicate the proper\n\"tune.\"\n\nThe secondary of the loosely coupled tuning coil produces a \"kick back\"\neffect on the primary, due to induction, and unless the two coils are\nsomewhat separated, the wave emitted from the transmitter will have more\nthan one \"hump\" and a person receiving the wave will be able to tune it\nin on two places on his tuning coil.\n\nA loosely coupled tuning coil does not radiate so much energy as a\nclosely coupled helix, but will, when properly tuned, emit a wave which\nis not so highly damped. Therefore as far as distance is concerned the\nloosely coupled type is perhaps the most efficient.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. KEYS.\n\n\nTHE keys used in wireless work differ from those used in commercial wire\ntelegraphy in being much heavier and stronger, so as to conduct and\nbreak the heavier currents without heating. Where very powerful currents\nmust be broken the contacts of the key usually operate under oil or in\nthe magnetic field of a pair of electromagnets. In other cases a small\nkey is used to operate a heavy relay. In the former type a metal arm\nprojects downward from the lever of an ordinary Morse telegraph key into\na compartment filled with oil. The arm is provided with a platinum point\nwhich makes contact with another similar point on the bottom of the\ncompartment, so that the break is made under oil and the key remains\ncool and does not arc. In the second form the same result is\naccomplished by a magnetic \"blowout.\" The \"blowout\" is merely an\nelectromagnet connected in series with the key and its poles at right\nangles to the contacts of the key. When the circuit is broken the\nmagnetic field extinguishes the arc which tends to form between the\ncontacts of the key.\n\nAn ordinary Morse key may be used with coils operated on batteries if\nthey do not give more than a four-inch spark. Larger coils or\ntransformers, especially if they are operated on the 110-volt current,\nrequire a heavier key. Where an ordinary Morse key is used with a 3-inch\nor 4-inch coil it is a very good plan to provide an auxiliary conductor,\none end of which is fastened to the metal base and the other end to the\nadjusting screw on the back of the lever. A piece of flexible lamp cord\nis suitable for this purpose. This precaution saves the pivots of the\nkey from heating and possible burning by heavy currents.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. Morse Key fitted with Extension Lever.]\n\nThe most convenient method is to fit up an old Morse key in the manner\nshown in Fig. 67. The lever is extended by a piece of aluminum or brass\n6 inches long and 5/16 inch thick. The exact shape and the dimensions\nare indicated in the illustration.\n\nThe extension lever is provided with a 1/2-inch round brass or nickel\nsteel contact 7/8 inch long. The lower end of the contact is bored and\ntapped to receive a short machine screw. The other contact is a similar\npiece projecting downwards from a small arm fastened to the top of a\nstandard 1/2 inch diameter and 2 inches long. The arm is a strip of\nbrass 1/2 inch wide, 1/4 inch thick, and 1 1/2 inches long, fastened to\nthe top of the standard with a machine screw. The brass standard is held\nin an upright position by means of a small machine screw which passes\nthrough the base. A wire connects with this screw to a heavy binding\npost mounted on the base. Connection is made with contact on the\nextension lever by means of a piece of heavy flexible lamp cord, which\nalso runs to a binding post mounted on the base. The contact is\ninsulated from the extension lever by means of two mica insulating\nwashers and a bushing. Avoid running the connection to the base of the\nkey so that the current must pass through the bearings. The contacts\nshould be filed until they are perfectly flat and square across and make\ncontact over their entire surface. When carefully constructed a key of\nthis type will carry without heating almost any currents in reach of the\namateur operator and which his induction coil or transformer will stand.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Wireless Key.]\n\nThe plans and dimensions for a heavier key are shown in Fig. 68. A\nwooden pattern of the base and bearings is made and taken to a brass\nfoundry where a casting in brass may be secured. The pattern should be\nof the same shape and size as the finished article represented in the\nfigure. It is given a slight taper so that it may be easily withdrawn\nfrom the sand mold. The brass casting is finished up square and smooth\nby grinding on an emery wheel or by careful filing. The lever is a piece\nof brass rod 1/2 inch square and 6 1/2 inches long. One end is fitted\nwith an ordinary hard rubber Morse key knob. The knurled nuts and\nthumbscrews are of the same size as those used on an ordinary key, and\nmay be purchased from an electrical supply house.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. \"United Wireless Type Key.\"]\n\nThe pivot is a piece of 3/16 inch round steel 1 inch long, and passes\nthrough the lever 1 1/2 inches from the rear end. The ends are ground or\nturned to sharp points and rest in bearings formed by boring a recess in\nthe ends of the thumbscrews. The thumbscrews pass through the center of\nthe bearing, standards 3/4 inch above the base. The lever is clamped to\nthe center of the pivot by means of a small machine screw. A heavy piece\nof spring brass, _S_, 1/2 inch wide and 3 inches long, is fastened to\nthe base at one end with a short 8-32 screw. The other end is bent\nupward so that it presses hard against the lower end of an adjusting\nscrew, which passes through the lever 1 1/4 inches forward of the pivot.\nThis spring serves as an auxiliary conductor and saves the key from\ncarrying an excessive current through its bearings. By adjusting the\nthumbscrew, the tension of the key may be regulated to suit the\noperator. The contacts of the key are 1/8-inch round nickel steel alloy\nor pure silver, set in short 1/4-inch machine screws which fit into\ncorrespondingly threaded holes in the base and the lever. This makes the\ncontacts easily removable for renewal. The lower contact is set in a\nlonger screw than the upper one so that connection may be made to it. It\nis insulated from the base by a hard rubber brushing.\n\nThe contacts must be directly above one another and in perfect alignment\nor else they will pit and stick.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. AERIAL SWITCHES AND ANCHOR GAPS.\n\n\nSome form of switch for quickly connecting the aerial and ground to\neither the transmitting or receiving apparatus is necessary.\n\nLow powered stations using an induction coil as a transmitter will find\na 250-volt double pole, double throw porcelain base switch to be\nsuitable. Such a switch is connected up according to the diagram shown\nin Fig. 70. As clearly illustrated, the receiving apparatus is in use\nwhen the switch is thrown to the right, and the transmitter is ready for\noperation when the switch is in the left-hand position. The ease and\nspeed with which such a switch may be thrown from right to left or vice\nversa may be much facilitated by fitting it with a larger and longer\nhandle than the one usually provided.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. Connections for Aerial Switch.]\n\nAn ordinary double pole, double throw switch should be mounted on the\nwall within easy reach of the operator, while the two types of switch\nabout to be described are best situated directly on the operating table\nalongside of the transmitting key.\n\nAll insulated parts of an aerial switch such as the base, insulating\nbar, handle, etc., should be made of some good insulating material, as\nporcelain, hard rubber or ebonite. All insulation which is used in power\nswitches such as slate, wood, marble, etc., is worthless and should not\nbe used.\n\nIf a loop aerial system is used, a switch is necessary, which will break\nthe primary transmitting current so that in case of an accidental touch\nof the key while receiving, the high voltage discharge will not pass\nacross the anchor gap into the receptor and badly damage the same or\nshock the operator. The connections of such a switch and the loop aerial\nare shown in the wiring diagram of the De Forest system.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Aerial Switches.]\n\nA switch may be easily constructed from a 50 ampere, single throw,\ntriple pole, fuseless power switch. If it is mounted on a slate base\nremove it and set it up on a base of the same size made of fiber or\nporcelain. Flat unglazed tiles of various sizes are obtainable from tile\nsetters at a very low cost. They may be easily bored with an ordinary\nsteel twist drill. Such tiles are excellent insulators when not exposed\nto moisture and are useful for bases, etc., in many cases. A heavy coat\nof shellac varnish will make the tile impervious to moisture.\n\nA hard rubber rod, _S_, 3 inches long and 5/8 inch diameter, is mounted\non both sides of the base in alignment with the contacts. A strip of\nhard rubber, _Y_, 1 inch wide, 1/2 inch thick and 6 1/2 inches long is\nfitted with two contacts similar to those mounted on the base of the\nswitch. The contacts are mounted at a distance apart equal to the\ndistance between the outside knife blades of the switch. A 1/8-inch hole\nis bored through the strip at both ends, through the axis of the rods\nalong their entire length and through the base. A piece of brass rod 4\ninches long and threaded at both ends with an 8-32 die is passed through\nthe holes and yoke, so that the rods may be held firmly to the base and\nthe strip to the tops of the rods by two nuts screwed on the ends of the\nbrass rod.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Detail of Contacts.]\n\nThe upper contacts should be directly over the two outside lower ones.\nThey are made from a strip of brass 1/2 inch wide, 3 1/2 inches long and\n1/16 inch thick (bent as in Fig. 72). A binding post is mounted on the\nyoke directly above and connecting with each one of the contacts.\n\nThe middle pole of the switch is connected to the primary of the coil or\ntransformer, so that when the switch is down, the primary circuit is\ncompleted, and when it is up it is broken.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Details of Switch Parts.]\n\nSome may prefer to make the complete switch, and in that case the\ndimensions given in Fig. 73 may be of aid. The knife blades are 6 inches\nlong, 5/8 inch wide and 1/8 inch thick. Three are required. A 1/8-inch\nhole is bored 3/8 inch from one end, and the other end is cut out in the\nshape shown in the illustration. An insulating bar 5 x 3/4 x 5/8 inches\nis made of hard rubber and three notches are cut in the back face, one\ndirectly in the center and one 2 inches on either side.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Method of Fastening Knife.]\n\nThree 1/8-inch holes are bored one in the center of each groove and at\nright angles to it. An 8-32 machine screw 3/4 inch long is placed in the\nnotch in the end of the knife blade and the screw passed through the\nhole in the insulating bar. The blade may then be clamped tightly in\nplace by putting a nut on the end of the screw. The screw which holds\nthe middle knife blade in place is longer than the other two so that a\nhandle may be fitted on.\n\nThe bearings are made the same size and shape as the contacts\nillustrated in Fig. 72, with the exception that a 1/8-inch hole is bored\nthrough near the top so that a small bolt may be slipped in to hold the\nknife blades in place.\n\nThe base of the switch measures 8 x 9 x 3/4 inches. The parts are\nassembled as in Fig. 71.\n\nAnother type of aerial switch called a \"T\" switch is illustrated in the\nsame figure. A piece of 3/4-inch hard rubber is sawed in the shape of a\nT, 3 1/2 inches high and 6 1/2 inches wide at the top. The upper\ncontacts are mounted on arms of the \"T\" and connected to binding posts\nplaced immediately above them, A slot, 1/2 inch wide and 3 inches long,\nsawed in the center of the leg of the T, permits the middle knife blade\nto move without obstruction.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. \"T\" Aerial Switch.]\n\nA double pole, double throw switch may be easily adapted to form a \"T\"\nswitch. Two knives are cut from sheet brass, of the same shape as those\nalready on the switch but twice as long. The contacts at one end of the\nporcelain base are removed and the bearings of the knife blade fastened\nthere in their stead. This forms a single throw, double pole switch\nhaving knife blades twice the length of the original double pole, double\nthrow switch. A \"T\" shaped support for the upper contacts may be sawed\nout of 1/2-inch hard rubber and smoothed up with a file. The support is\nfastened upright by means of two screws which pass through holes in the\ncenter of the base where the knife bearings originally were. The two\ncontacts which were removed from the base are fastened to the support\ndirectly over the knife blades so that they make a good contact when the\nswitch is up. Two binding posts mounted above the contacts make\nconnection with them.\n\nIf desirable the switch may be fitted with a third knife blade and\ncontact so that when the switch is up in position for receiving, the\nprimary circuit of the induction coil or small transformer is open.\n\nIt is obvious that the dimensions, etc., need not be the same as those\ngiven here but may be adapted to suit the size and design of the switch\nwhich is to be altered. The knives should always be as long as\nconvenient and the contacts separated by a wide space.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. \"United\" Wireless Lightning Switch.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Shoemaker Tuning Coil and Aerial Switch.]\n\nFigs. 76 and 77 illustrate the aerial switches used in the installations\nof the United Wireless Telegraph Company. These illustrations give a\ngood idea of the long knife blades employed. The lightning switch is\nfitted with a micrometer spark gap on top of the switch which is in\nservice when the handle is up. The small spark gap affords a path for\nthe lightning to jump into the ground, but cannot be bridged by the\nreceiving currents.\n\n*Anchor Gaps.*\u2014When a loop aerial system is employed for both\ntransmitting and receiving, a device known as an anchor gap becomes\nnecessary.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. \"United\" Wireless Anchor Gaps.]\n\nThe construction and connection of a simple anchor gap are shown in Fig.\n79. A ring 1 3/4 inches outside and 1 1/4 inches inside is cut out of\n5/8-inch hard rubber or fiber and smoothed up. Three 1/8-inch holes are\nbored in the periphery of the ring at 120 degrees to each other. The\nholes are threaded with a 10-24 tap. Three small binding posts are each\nfitted with a 3/16-inch brass rod 7/8 inch long, having a 10-24 thread\nso that they may be screwed into the holes in the ring.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Anchor Gap.]\n\nThe gap between the ends of the two rods connected to the aerial and the\nreceiving apparatus is adjusted until it is about 1/8 inch long. The\nthird point is screwed in until it all but touches the other two.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. HOT WIRE AMMETER.\n\n\nWhen a current passes through a conductor, it generates heat in\nproportion to the resistance offered and the amount of current flowing.\nHeat causes metals to expand sufficiently so that these two properties\nmay be applied to the construction of a hot wire ammeter for the\nmeasurement of alternating currents of high frequency and potential.\n\nThe hot wire ammeter is placed in series with the aerial, so that by\nnoting the deflection of the pointer, the inductance, capacity and spark\ngap may be adjusted until the meter gives a maximum reading.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. Simple Hot Wire Meter.]\n\nA simple and crude form of meter which is sufficiently sensitive for\nmost experimental work is illustrated in Fig. 80. A piece of No. 36 B.\nS. platinum wire is sealed in the bulb of an ordinary air thermometer.\nWhen the wire becomes heated by a passing current of electricity, it\ncauses the air in the bulb to expand and change the height of the\ncolored liquid in the tube.\n\nAn air-thermometer is simply a glass tube of fine bore having a bulb\nblown at the upper end and the free end immersed in a reservoir of ink\nor some other colored liquid. The instrument is put in working order by\ngrasping the bulb in the palm of the hand, so that the warmth of the\nhand will expand the air and cause some of it to escape from the lower\nend of the tube. Upon removing the hand, the air will contract and suck\nsome of the liquid up into the tube. It should rise only about half way\nto the bulb, and the tube should be about 18 inches long so as to leave\nroom for changes in the position of the column due to variations in the\noutside atmosphere. A cardboard scale graduated in inches and reading\ndownward is fastened in back of the tube.\n\nThe tube should have a fine bore so as to make the instrument as\nsensitive as possible. The best liquid to use is alcohol, colored with a\nlittle aniline dye. Alcohol has a lower specific gravity than water, and\nthe column will be more sensitive to small changes of pressure. The same\nfigure shows a form of meter devised and used with success by the\nauthor.\n\nTwo tubes are fitted to the bulb, a large one having a bore of about 0.1\nof an inch and another about 0.04 inch. Connection is established by the\naid of two corks and a short length of glass tubing one inch in\ndiameter. The tubes are bent U shaped, and a little colored alcohol is\nplaced in each, so that the bottle reservoir is unnecessary. The tube of\nlarge bore is fitted at the top with an ordinary glass stopcock such as\nthat used in chemical laboratories.\n\nThe stopcock is left open and the transmitter is set in operation by\nholding down the key. The helix, etc., are adjusted until the larger\ntube shows a maximum reading. The stop-cock is then closed and the\ninstruments further adjusted by noting the reading in the finer tube\nwhich corresponds to much smaller changes in current. The finer bore\ncannot at first be used alone because the large changes of current would\nblow the liquid out of the tube. In lieu of a glass stopcock, a piece of\nrubber tubing may be placed over the end of the tube and closed, when\nnecessary, with a pinch cock.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. Meter with Case Removed.]\n\nFig. 81 shows a more elaborate and sensitive form of meter which is not\nonly suitable for experimental outfits but may be used with good results\nfor more careful work. The advantage of the form of meter here described\nis that it is \"pivotless\" so to speak, and contains no bearings which\nrequire jewels to eliminate friction.\n\nThe \"hot wire\" is platinum, and in order to compensate for external\nchanges of the atmospheric temperature, is mounted on a strip of glass.\nGlass and platinum expand at nearly the same rate, and the wire is thus\nkept taut and prevented from changing the position of the pointer except\nwhen the current passes.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Glass Compensating Strip.]\n\nDrill four 1/8-inch holes in a piece of window glass 6 inches long and 1\ninch wide. The location of the holes is shown in Fig. 82. The two at the\nends serve to mount the standards, _A_ and _B_, and those at the center\nto fasten down the strip to the base. The holes are drilled with a small\nthree-cornered file which has been broken off and set in a breast drill.\nThe broken end should be used to drill the glass and be kept thoroughly\nlubricated with camphor and turpentine. With a little care and patience\nthe holes may be drilled without breaking the glass.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. Details of \"Hot Wire\" Supports.]\n\nTwo brass standards are fastened on each end of the glass. They are bent\nout of sheet brass and are 3/4 inch high and 3/8 inch wide. A brass\nspring of the same width and 1 1/4 inches long is clamped under one\nstandard. The standard which holds the spring in position is tapped for\na small thumbscrew which may be secured from a binding post. Solder a\nsmall brass pin to the top of the spring and another one to the top of\nthe standard which is fastened at the opposite end of the glass strip.\nSome paper or rubber washers must be placed between the feet of the\nstandards and the glass strip to prevent it from cracking when the\nscrews are tightened.\n\nFor a station up to one-half K.W. in power the hot wire must be No. 40\nB. S. gauge platinum. For larger stations a single No. 36 wire may be\nused or three No. 40 wires in parallel. The wire must be about 7 inches\nlong. Stretch it between the standard, _A_, and the spring, _C_. Wrap\nthe ends around the pins and solder them there, using as small amount of\nsolder as possible. The tension of the wire, which should be taut, is\nadjusted with the thumbscrew.\n\nTake a piece of the platinum wire about 1/2 inch long and make a little\neyelet at one end. Wrap the straight end around the center of the long\nhot wire and tie a piece of silk in the eyelet.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Details of Movement.]\n\nThe glass strip and its standards supporting the hot wire may then be\nfastened to the baseboard of the instrument by means of two round headed\nbrass wood screws. Two rubber washers must be interposed between the\nglass and the wood. A piece of 3/32 inch brass 1/2 inch wide and 3 1/4\ninches long is bent in the shape shown by _F_ in Fig. 84. The upper end\nis bored and tapped to receive a thumbscrew similar to the one in the\nstandard on the glass strip. Two brass springs 1/64 inch thick, 3/8 inch\nwide and 1 1/4 inches long are soldered or riveted at opposite ends of\n_F_ in the positions shown in Fig. 85. The springs should project one\ninch from the upright. A small hook made from an ordinary pin is\nsoldered to the outside end of each.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. Complete Movement.]\n\nThe movement is shown in perspective by Fig. 85. _G_ is a rectangle of\nvery thin copper, 1/2 inch long and 1/4 inch wide, having a little\nprojection 1/4 inch long bent in a curve so that it forms a sextant of a\ncircle, of which the intersection of the diagonals of _G_ would be the\ncenter.\n\nThe pointer is a piece of steel wire 5 inches long. It is slightly\nflattened by hammering so that it will retain its shape and not curl.\nAbout 1/2 inch is allowed to project through _G_ and is weighted with a\nlead shot so as to partly counterbalance its weight.\n\nTwo loops of wire are fastened to the corners of _G_ by tying them in\nholes which are bored there for that purpose. The wire is fine phosphor\nbronze .003-.005 of an inch in diameter, which is used for suspending\nthe movements of delicate galvanometers. Pass the loops over the hooks\non the springs and adjust until the pointer moves horizontally. Then\nfasten the wires permanently to the hooks by means of a small drop of\nsolder.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Side View of Hot Wire and Movement.]\n\nThe movement is mounted in the position shown by Fig. 86. The silk\nthread tied to the eyelet runs to the little sextant and is cemented at\nthe further end by means of a small drop of sealing wax. The scale is a\npiece of sheet copper or brass, covered with white paper and calibrated\nin degrees or made to read in amperes by connecting it in series with an\nammeter and a source of direct current. A rheostat should be included in\nthe circuit and the current varied so that various values may be marked\noff. All the different points must be located by sending an actual\ncurrent of that value through the meter. An error is liable to result if\nany of the points are marked by guesswork, for the divisions grow\nsmaller and smaller as they become farther away from zero. For example a\nposition of the pointer corresponding to 0.1 of an ampere will not be\nhalf way between zero and 0.2 but will be nearer the 0.2 division.\n\nThe resistance of wires to high frequency currents is much higher than\ntheir resistance to constant currents. This would seem at first to\nindicate that our meter will give a higher reading for an equal current\nvalue, when used with a high frequency current after being calibrated\nwith a direct current. But with wires of very small diameter such as No.\n40 B. S. gauge there is almost no perceptible difference and\nconsequently no error unless the frequency of the oscillations exceeds\n1,000,000 per second, which is very unlikely with the \"spark\" method of\nwireless telegraphy.\n\nFig. 87 illustrates the form of hot wire ammeter used by the United\nWireless Telegraph Co. for tuning their installations.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. United Wireless Hot Wire Ammeter.]\n\nThe pivotless meter just described should be fitted with heavy binding\nposts which are connected to the brass standards mounted on the glass\nstrip by means of stranded copper wire.\n\nThe meter should be fitted with a case and glass cover to exclude dust\nand prevent injury to the working parts. It should be mounted in such a\nposition that the weight of the pointer is sufficient to keep the silk\nthread taut so that when the wire expands the pointer which is normally\nat zero will fall of its own weight. When the wire cools after the\ncurrent has ceased to flow, it will contract and draw the pointer up\nagain.\n\nPlatinum wire will give good results, but for more accurate work an\nalloy known as platinoid is most suitable.\n\nDetailed instructions for tuning the transmitting circuits by means of a\nhot wire ammeter are given in the chapter on Transmitting Helixes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. OSCILLATION DETECTORS.\n\n\n\n\"UNIVERSAL\" DETECTOR.\n\n\nThe purpose and position of the detector in a wireless telegraph system\nhas already received some notice in the first chapter, but its operation\nand adjustment are so important that this chapter deserves the most\ncareful consideration. The receiving range of a station is not as much\ndependent upon the aerial system as it is upon the adjustment of the\ntuning circuits and the detector itself.\n\nIt is suggested that the amateur experimenter not confine his work to\nreceiving only with a single type of detector but rather accustom\nhimself to the different instruments.\n\nDuring the past few years many wireless telegraph detectors have been\ninvented which lend themselves readily to amateur construction. It is\nsomewhat of a convenience to have a \"universal\" detector which with a\nlittle manipulation may be used as more than one type and thus save\nunnecessary expense and much labor.\n\nThe \"universal\" detector shown in Fig. 88 has been so designed as to\npresent a good appearance and at the same time be successfully operated\nas an electrolytic, tantalum, peroxide of lead, silicon, carborundum or\nany of the crystal type detectors.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Universal Detector.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Details of Universal Detector.]\n\nThe standard, _R_, is a 3/4-inch hard rubber rod, 1 1/4 inches long,\nwith a 3/16 inch hole bored through its axis. A spring, _S_, is made\nafter the plan shown in Fig. 86. It is 2 inches long and 1/16 inch\nthick. A brass collar 1/8 inch thick and 3/8 inch diameter is soldered\non the smaller end of the spring in order to so reenforce it that it may\nbe bored and threaded with an 8-32 tap to receive a thumbscrew. The\nbrass standard, _D_, is a small cylinder 3/8 inch high and 1/2 inch in\ndiameter. A 3/16 inch hole is bored through its axis. The arm, _A_, is\nbrass and measures 1 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/4 inches. The ends are rounded by\nfiling or grinding so that they coincide with the semi-circumference of\na circle having a diameter of 1/2 inch. Two holes are bored on the\ncenter line 1/4 inch from each end.\n\nOne is a 1/8-inch hole and the other is threaded with a 10-32 tap to fit\nthe large adjusting screw. The adjusting screw, _H_, is 1 1/4 inches\nlong and has a 10-32 thread. A hard rubber head 1 inch thick and 1 1/4\ninches in diameter is clamped to the upper end by means of two hexagonal\nbrass nuts. A small brass washer should be placed between the head and\neach of the nuts to give it a more finished appearance and prevent the\nnuts from marring the rubber.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 90. Parts of Universal Detector.]\n\nThe brass bed plate, _B_, is 1/8 inch thick, 3 inches long and 2 inches\nwide. Two holes are drilled on the center line 9/16 inch and 7/8 inch\nfrom either end. One is 3/8 inch in diameter and the other is threaded\nwith an 8-32 tap. An insulating bushing in the shape of a hard rubber\nwasher on the lower end of _R_, 1/8 inch thick and 3/8 inch in diameter,\nhas a 3/16-inch hole bored in its center and is fitted in the larger\nhole in the bedplate. The whole detector is assembled and mounted on a\nhard rubber base 4 x 5 x 4 inches. A brass binding rod, _M_, 3 1/4\ninches long and having an 8-32 thread, is passed successively through\nthe arm, the brass standard, the spring, the hard rubber standard and\nthe bedplate. A hexagonal brass nut on the under side of the base and a\nthumb nut on the brass arm serves to bind the whole tightly together.\nFour binding posts are mounted on the four corners of the base. Two are\nconnected to the brass binding rod and two to the bedplate. This\ncompletes the universal part of the detector. The remaining parts are\neach described under the headings of the respective detectors to which\nthey belong.\n\n\n\nELECTROLYTIC DETECTORS.\n\n\n*\"Bare Point\" Type.*\u2014Although the electrolytic is the oldest of a long\nline of very sensitive detectors,\u00b3 it still holds first rank when in the\nhands of an experienced and skillful operator. It exists in two\ndifferent forms, but the more favored is that known as the Fessenden\n\"bare point\" type, which consists of a very fine Woolaston platinum wire\n(.001-.00002 of an inch in diameter) dipping in a small cup of dilute\nacid. The acid is either 20 per cent chemically pure nitric or\nsulphuric.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 91. Bare Point Electrolytic Detector.]\n\nA large electrode of platinum wire or foil dips into or is sealed in the\nbottom of the cup so as to make an electrical connection with the\nliquid. The fine Woolaston wire is clamped over the cup in a holder\nwhich permits of vertical adjustment, by means of a thumbscrew, so that\nthe depth of immersion in the acid may be regulated.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. Effect of Exposing too much Wire.]\n\nWoolaston wire is covered with a comparatively thick coating of silver,\nwhich before using must be removed from the end for about 1/32 inch by\ndipping it in strong nitric acid, which will dissolve the silver and\nexpose the almost invisible platinum core. Too much of the fine platinum\ncore must not be exposed or else the surface tension of the acid will\ncause the wire to curl over and present a large flat surface instead of\na fine point. This is a very necessary and important precaution, for the\ndetector is more sensitive as the area of contact between the fine wire\nand the liquid is smaller.\n\nWhenever this condition is reached the end of the wire should be cut off\nwith a pair of sharp scissors and a new point exposed.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 93. Electrolytic Detector Circuits.]\n\nThe detector circuit is shown in Fig. 93. The fine \"bare point\" is\nalways made the positive or anode of the battery circuit. Otherwise the\ndetector will not operate. A potentiometer must be shunted across the\nterminals of the battery to reduce the voltage to a value just below\nthat which is required to break down the thin film of oxygen gas which\ncollects on the \"bare point\" and polarizes it or insulates it from the\nliquid so that little or no battery current can flow. This film of gas\nis caused by the electrolysis of the acid solution and the decomposition\nof the water into hydrogen and oxygen gas.\n\nWhen oscillations are set up in the receiving aerial and they surge\nthrough the detector, a sufficient e.m.f. is generated to break down the\nfilm of gas and permit the battery current to flow again. The passage of\ncurrent causes the signals in the telephone receivers.\n\nThe electrolytic cup for the universal detector is illustrated in Fig.\n90. It is made of a piece of hard rubber rod 3/4 inch in diameter and\n3/4 inch high. A recess 1/2 inch in diameter and 3/8 inch deep is cut in\nthe top to contain the acid. A small hole 1/4 inch deep is bored in the\nunder side and threaded with an 8-32 tap. A brass pin 1/2 inch long,\nhaving a corresponding thread, is fitted in the hole. The pin may then\nbe screwed into the small hole in the bedplate. A piece of No. 30 B. S.\ngauge platinum wire or a strip of platinum foil is clamped between the\nbottom of the cup and the bedplate and then bent over the top of the cup\ninto the liquid.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 94. Electrolytic Detector.]\n\nA 1/16-inch hole 1/4 inch deep is bored in the lower end of a thumbscrew\nhaving an 8-32 thread. A piece of Woolaston wire 1/2 inch long is placed\nin the center of the hole and tinfoil packed into the surrounding space\nwith the head of a sewing needle until the wire is held firmly in\nposition. The free end of the wire must then be dipped in some strong\nnitric acid to remove the silver. The thumbscrew is placed in the collar\non the end of the spring of the universal detector and lowered until the\n\"bare point\" almost touches the surface of the electrolyte in the cup\nbeneath. Pressure must then be applied to the spring by turning the\nlarge adjusting screw until the \"bare point\" touches the liquid and a\nclick is heard in the telephone receivers and a faint bubbling sound is\nalso audible. The adjusting screw must then be slowly and carefully\nturned in the opposite direction so as to raise the point until the\nbubbling changes to a hissing sound. The point is then above the level\nof the electrolyte in the cup but is still in contact with it because of\nthe capillary action of the fine wire and the liquid.\n\nBy using the large adjusting screw as much as possible, instead of the\nsmall thumbscrew, the point is raised or lowered without giving it a\ncircular motion and much finer adjustment is made possible. The\npotentiometer is adjusted until the hissing noise caused by excessive\nbattery voltage just disappears. The detector is then in its most\nsensitive condition for receiving signals.\n\nWhen the detector is in use for long periods, the potentiometer must be\nfrequently readjusted to compensate the gradual loss in voltage of the\nbattery. It is well to provide a small switch which will disconnect the\nbattery from the potentiometer when the detector is not in use. In the\nsame case the acid should be removed and placed in a tightly stoppered\nbottle. A pipette or fountain pen filler furnishes the most convenient\nmeans for filling or emptying the cup. The acid must be kept perfectly\npure and out of contact with all metals other than platinum. Great care\nshould be exercised in filling the cup, for the acid, if spilled, will\nnot only badly corrode the metal fittings, but will also provide a\ncurrent leak and seriously weaken the signals.\n\n*Shoemaker and Stone Detectors.*\u2014These two types of detectors make use\nof \"glass points,\" so called because the fine platinum wire is sealed in\na glass tube and the end of the tube is then ground down on a fine\noilstone until the platinum wire is exposed. This results in a very fine\ncontact area and insures constant immersion of the point without\nreadjustment.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 95. Forming \"Glass\" Point.]\n\nThe fine platinum wire for a glass point may be secured from one of the\nflaming pocket cigar lighters making use of spongy platinum. The center\nof a thick walled glass tube is softened by heat and contracted as shown\nat _A-B_ in Fig. 95. After cooling, the tube is cut in half at the point\nindicated by the dotted line. The platinum wire is placed in the\ncontracted end of the tube and carefully fused in so that about one-half\nof the wire, which is about 1/2 inch long, is embedded in the glass. The\ncontracted end of the tube containing the wire should be closed.\nConnection is established to the upper end of the fine platinum wire by\nfilling the tube with mercury and dipping a piece of flexible conductor\nin the mercury. The upper end of the tube is closed and the mercury\nprevented from escaping by a small dab of sealing wax.\n\nThe \"point\" is slowly and carefully rubbed on a fine oilstone kept well\nwet with water. The tube must be held in a vertical position so that the\nglass will be ground away at right angles. When it is thought that the\nplatinum wire has been exposed by the grinding, connect the flexible\nconductor to one pole of a battery. The other pole of the battery is\nconnected to a pair of sensitive telephone receivers and the telephone\nreceivers to a vessel containing dilute acid. If the platinum wire is\nexposed, a sharp click will be heard in the telephone receivers when the\n\"point\" is dipped in the acid. Do not confuse the sharp click with the\nsound which may be occasioned because the outside of the glass tube is\ndamp or wet.\n\nAfter the point has been sufficiently ground, disconnect the testing\napparatus and connect the free end of the flexible conductor to a\nbinding post placed on the end of the detector spring, _S_. The detector\ncircuit is similar to that of the \"bare point\" type.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. Shoemaker Detector.]\n\nThe illustration shows what is sometimes called a \"primary cell\"\ndetector because it furnishes its own current and does not require a\nbattery. A Stone detector may be very easily changed to one of the\nShoemaker type by substituting an amalgamated zinc rod for the platinum\nwire anode which makes connection with the liquid in the cup. This\ncombination of platinum and zinc results in an electromotive force of\nabout 0.7 volt, and the telephone receivers are connected directly to\nthe terminals of the detector without any local battery or\npotentiometer. The electrolyte in the cup must be a 20 per cent solution\nof pure sulphuric acid, as nitric acid would dissolve the zinc in a very\nfew minutes. The zinc must be kept well amalgamated with mercury.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Shoemaker Detector Circuits.]\n\nThe Shoemaker system makes use of a loop aerial, and the circuits with a\nsingle and double coil tuner are illustrated in Fig. 97. It is not\nnecessary to use these, and the detector will operate just exactly as\nwell on a \"straightaway\" aerial.\n\n*Lamp Detector.*\u2014All electrolytic detectors, more especially those of\nthe \"glass point\" type, are subject to the annoyance of \"burn-outs.\"\nThat is, the fine platinum wire melts when receiving strong signals from\na near-by station.\n\nIn such case, the \"bare point\" must be lowered until it again makes\ncontact with the liquid, and the \"glass point\" reground until the wire\nis again exposed.\n\nWhen this trouble comes often it is very convenient to have at hand a\nsimple detector which will not burn out and which may be substituted for\nthe usual one when great sensitiveness is not required.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. Lamp Detector.]\n\nSuch an instrument is made by snipping off the tip of a small\nincandescent electric lamp and removing the filament with a wire. One of\nthe leading-in wires is broken off as close as possible to the glass\nstub and the globe half filled with a 20 per cent acid solution. The\nbroken wire must be made the negative or cathode and connected like a\nFessenden or Stone detector. This lamp detector though crude will give\ngood service without burning out when used to receive from near-by\nstations.\n\nIn place of a lamp detector, a glass point having a larger wire than\nthat of the cigar lighter may be used instead of the usual point, but it\nwill not be so sensitive.\n\nFig. 99 illustrates a simple form of electrolytic detector which is not\nso sensitive as that shown in Fig. 100 but is still very serviceable.\n\nThe cup is made from the carbon of an old dry cell, the brass connecting\ncap serving very well to make the connections to. It has a recess about\n1/2 inch in diameter and 1/4 inch deep cut in the top to contain the\nelectrolyte. The cup should be about one inch high. A file will smooth\nup any rough edges and give it a good appearance.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 99. Simple Electrolytic Detector.]\n\nThe yoke is made of a piece of 1/8-inch sheet brass about 3/4 inch wide,\nbent in the shape shown in the illustration. Two small holes are drilled\nin the feet, to serve to fasten the yoke firmly to the base and also to\nmake connection to.\n\nThe adjusting screw may be made from the screw taken from the carbon of\nan old dry cell. To permit of accurate adjustment, it should be fitted\nwith a large head made from a piece of 1/4-inch hard rubber or fiber cut\nin a circle about 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Bore a small hole about 1/8\ninch in diameter through the center of the head and force it on the\nscrew. A nut screwed on the under side will then clamp it tightly\nagainst the brass head. A hole is bored in the center of the yoke and a\nbattery nut which will fit the adjusting screw soldered directly under\nit.\n\nThe platinum wire may be either soldered to the adjusting screw or\nfastened with tinfoil in the method which has been described.\n\nThe cup and yoke are best mounted on a piece of hard rubber 1/2 inch\nthick, 3 inches wide and 4 inches long. A binding post is placed near\neach of the four corners.\n\nIt is possible to do extremely fine and long distance work with the\ndetector illustrated in Fig. 100. It is so arranged that the \"bare\npoint\" need not necessarily be revolved when making an adjustment, and\nso it is possible to place it in a very sensitive condition.\n\nA brass standard, _U_, 1 1/4 inches long is cut from a piece of 1/2-inch\nrod. A hole bored in the top and bottom of the standard is threaded with\nan 8-32 tap. A brass rod, _R_, 2 inches long is threaded with an 8-32\ndie throughout its entire length. One end is screwed in the top of _U_.\n\nA piece of brass tubing, _P_, 1 1/4 inches long and having an internal\nbore of 1/2 inch is slipped over _U_. A slot cut in _P_ fits over a\nsmall pin set in _U_ and permits _P_ to be slid up and down but not to\nturn around.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. Electrolytic Detector.]\n\nA head in the form of a circular brass washer, _E_, 1/8 inch thick, 1/2\ninch in diameter and having a 5/32-inch hole bored in the center is\nsoldered in the top of the tube, _P_.\n\nA circular piece of hard rubber, _H_, 2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch\nthick is fitted with a brass bushing having a hole in the center with an\n8-32 thread to screw on the rod, _R_.\n\nA spiral spring is placed around _R_ between _U_ and the head _E_. A\nsmall brass washer should be placed between _H_ and _E_ in order to\neliminate friction. When _H_ is turned in one direction, the spring will\ncause _P_ to rise, and when turned in the other direction it will be\nlowered.\n\nA brass arm, _A_, 1/4 x 1/4 x 1 1/2 inches carries a small thumbscrew,\n_r_, at one end, while the other end is soldered to _P_ as shown in Fig.\n96. The Woolaston wire is soldered to _T_.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 101. Details of Electrolytic Detector.]\n\nA small carbon cup 3/4 x 3/4 inch serves to hold the electrolyte. A\n3/8-inch hole is bored 1/4 inch deep in the bottom of the cup and poured\nfull of melted lead. The lead is then bored and tapped to fit a machine\nscrew which fastens the cup to the base. Connection is made from a\nbinding post to the machine screw. A second binding post is connected to\nthe screw which fits into the bottom of _U_ and holds it to the base.\n\nIf desirable a circular piece of hard wood, _F_, may be turned out and\nglued to the base around the cup in order to give it a more finished\nappearance.\n\nThe thumbscrew, _T_, is used to lower the \"bare point\" until it almost\ntouches the liquid, and then the large head, _H_, is brought into play\nto make the finer adjustment.\n\n*Increasing the Sensitiveness of an Electrolytic Detector.* The\nsensitiveness of an electrolytic detector may be increased in three\nways, viz., by connecting two detectors in series, by warming the\nelectrolyte and by agitating it.\n\nThe first method is clearly apparent.\n\nThe second is accomplished by placing the detector over a sand bath and\ngently warming it. It will then show a marked increase in the strength\nof the signals at a temperature of about 30 C. This increase will\ncontinue to rise with the temperature until it reaches a maximum at\nabout 60 C.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 102. Increasing the Sensitiveness of an Electrolytic\nDetector.]\n\nBranly discovered that a fine stream of gas passed through the\nelectrolyte in order to agitate it increases the strength of the signals\nin the phones. He devised a detector provided with two extra platinum\nterminals sealed in the cup. When connected in series with a battery and\nan adjustable resistance, these terminals cause electrolysis of the\nwater, and a fine stream of oxygen and hydrogen gas flows through the\nacid electrolyte. The stream of gas agitates the liquid just\nsufficiently so that when oscillations strike the detector they augment\nthe breaking down of the film of gas which collects on the fine platinum\npoint. This results in an increase in the battery current flowing\nthrough the telephone receivers of from two to four times and a\ncorresponding increase in the volume of sound. The adjustable resistance\nis used to regulate the decomposition of the electrolyte and formation\nof gas, for if this proceeds too rapidly an undesirable rumbling noise\nwill be produced in the telephone receivers.\n\n\n\nTANTALUM DETECTOR.\n\n\nThe tantalum detector is especially suitable for the amateur\nexperimenter because its change in resistance when struck by\noscillations is so great that high resistance telephone receivers are\nnot necessary. Its normal resistance is about 1000-2000 ohms, and this\nsometimes drops as low as 125-100 ohms when struck by oscillations of\nordinary strength. It is not nearly so sensitive as the electrolytic or\ncrystal detectors, but gives very much louder tones in the telephone\nreceivers when used for short distance work.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Tantalum Detector.]\n\nThe detector is easily made by substituting a piece of tantalum wire for\nthe Woolaston wire of an ordinary electrolytic detector. The dilute acid\nsolution is removed from the cup and replaced by some pure mercury. The\nconnections remain the same as for the \"bare point.\" The potentiometer\nis adjusted until the potential of the battery is in the neighborhood of\n0.2-0.4 volt.\n\nThe tantalum wire may be easily secured by breaking the globe of a\ntantalum lamp and using a piece of the filament. It is best to snip off\nthe lamp tip before breaking the globe. This precaution admits the air\nand prevents an explosion which would shatter the glass and scatter the\nfilament in fragments.\n\nIf the universal detector is used with a tantalum point, turn the small\nthumbscrew until the wire almost touches the surface of the mercury.\nThen lower it with the large adjusting screw until the tantalum touches\nthe surface and a sharp click is heard in the telephone receivers.\nAdjust the potentiometer until the signals are the loudest.\n\n\n\nCRYSTAL DETECTORS.\n\n\nCertain minerals and crystals, principally members of the carbon and\nsulphur groups, possess the peculiar property of rectifying electrical\noscillations and converting them into a pulsating direct current. These\ncrystals conduct the current better in one direction than in the other.\nIn the case of a current having a potential of ten volts and applied to\nthe ends of a carborundum crystal, the current may be one hundred times\ngreater when flowing in one direction than when flowing in the other.\nThis ratio decreases as the voltage is raised, for with 25 volts it may\nbe only about forty times greater. The crystals when properly inserted\nin the aerial circuit are enabled to rectify the oscillations and\nproduce sounds in the telephone receivers without the aid of a battery.\n\nThe following is a partial list of the minerals and crystals exhibiting\nthese properties to a sufficient extent that they are of value as\noscillation detectors in wireless telegraphy.\n\nIn the case of iron pyrites the writer has found that a specimen of this\nmineral containing very little or no copper as an impurity does not\nexhibit these properties to an appreciable extent.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. United Wireless Carborundum Detector\n(horizontal type).]\n\nIn order to use the universal detector for minerals, a special contact\nsimilar to that shown in Fig. 90 must be made. The contact is bored and\nthreaded on its under side to fit a brass pin 3/4 inch long and having\nan 8-32 thread. The other end of the pin screws into the hole in the\nbedplate. The large knurled portion of the contact permits it to be\nraised or lowered without the fingers coming in contact with the\ncrystal. The crystal is clamped between the contact and the spring, _S_.\nThe position is varied until a sensitive spot is found and then the\npressure is carefully regulated by means of the large adjusting screw\nuntil the signals in the telephone receivers are the loudest. If\npossible avoid touching the crystals with the fingers, as the oil and\ndirt, even though it cannot always be seen, spoils their value for long\ndistance work. Use instead a pair of steel forceps.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 105. United Wireless Carborundum Detector (vertical\ntype).]\n\nThe United Wireless Telegraph Co. makes use of carborundum in the\ndetectors shown in Figs. 104 and 105. The principal advantage of\ncarborundum over such substances as silicon, etc., is that it is not\naffected by the heavy discharge of the transmitting apparatus and does\nnot require a new adjustment after each period of sending. All the\ncrystals will not work, and so a large cake should be purchased and the\ndesired crystals selected. The dark blue portions of the mass, which are\nthe hardest, will give the clearest tones in the telephone receivers,\nand are preferable to the lighter colored crystals. Since the crystals\nconduct better in one direction than in the other, as explained above,\nthe adjustment must be made with the view of determining in which\nposition the particular crystal will work the best.\n\nCarborundum will produce sounds in the telephone receivers without the\naid of any battery, but for careful work a battery and a potentiometer\nare necessary.\n\nThe other crystals given in the column merely require that the telephone\nreceivers be connected to the detector terminals as in the wiring\ndiagram in Fig. 108.\n\nThe Clapp-Eastham detector makes use of a crystal of iron pyrites held\nin a brass retaining cup beneath the metal contact point. It is not\naffected by strong signals and requires no battery or potentiometer.\nWhen adjusted it will remain in a sensitive condition for a long time\nwithout further attention.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Clapp-Eastham Ferron Detector.]\n\n*Silicon Detector.*\u2014While the silicon and \"perikon\" detectors are\nclassed as mineral or crystal detectors they deserve special attention.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Silicon Crystal in Cup.]\n\nSilicon gives fair results if a crystal is placed between two metal\nelectrodes as, for instance, between the contact and spring of the\n\"universal\" detector, but is much more sensitive when properly mounted.\nA brass cup such as that shown in Fig. 90 is made and the interior\nbrightened by scraping with a file. The cup is then poured full of a\nmolten fusible alloy and the silicon pressed in it until it cools and\nbecomes set. It should then present an appearance similar to that shown\nby _A_ in Fig. 107. The silicon is ground down by rubbing on the surface\nof a clean oilstone kept well wet with water, until the surface is flat\nand shows a polish.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. Silicon Detector Circuits.]\n\nThe cup containing the silicon is placed over the hole in the bedplate\nof the universal detector. A knurled brass thumbscrew having a point on\nits lower end is screwed into the collar on the spring, _S_, and brought\nto bear on the polished surface of the silicon. The pressure may be\neasily regulated by means of the large adjusting screw until the signals\nin the telephone receivers are the loudest. It is not advisable to\nfasten the cup to the bedplate but merely to brighten the bottom so as\nto insure a good contact. The cup may then be moved around so that\ndifferent portions of the polished surface of the silicon may be brought\ninto play when desirable.\n\nIf the knurled brass thumbscrew is fitted with a platinum point which\ncan be brought to bear on the surface of the silicon, the efficiency of\nthe detector will be materially increased.\n\nWhen mounting silicon or other crystals some careless experimenters use\nlead or a metal having a high melting point instead of a fusible alloy.\nThis is poor policy because the high temperature coats the surface of\nthe crystals and the interior of the cup with a non-conducting layer\nwhich destroys the sensitiveness and makes it unfit for long distance\nwork. A fusible alloy melting at about the boiling point of water or\neven lower should be used. Such alloys are usually composed of tin, lead\nand bismuth. The addition of a little cadmium serves to make the fusing\npoint considerably lower in each case. The alloys may be prepared by the\nexperimenter from the following formulae, or are obtainable from a firm\nmanufacturing fire plugs for automatic fire extinguishers.\n\nThe lead should be melted first and then the bismuth, tin and cadmium\nadded in the order named.\n\n*Perikon Detector.*\u2014The Perikon detector is one of the latest types to\ncome into extensive use. It consists of two crystals, zincite and\nchalcopyrites,\u2074 set in cups in the manner just described and placed in\ncontact with each other. The minerals are mounted similar to those in\nFig. 105. The zincite should present a rather flat surface with the\ngrain of the crystal parallel to the sides of the cup so that the top\nsurface corresponds to the end of a stick of wood sawed at right angles\nto the grain. More than one crystal of zincite is usually set in the\nsame cup. The chalcopyrites should present a rather blunt point. The cup\ncontaining the chalcopyrites is the smaller and is bored and threaded to\nfit a thumbscrew which passes through the collar in the spring, S, of\nthe \"universal\" detector. The bottom of the cup containing the zincite\nis brightened so as to insure a good contact and then placed on the bed\nplated under the cup containing the chalcopyrites which is fastened to\nthe thumbscrew. The zincite may then be moved around until the most\nsensitive portion is found. The chalcopyrites is lowered until it comes\ninto contact with the zincite and then the pressure regulated by means\nof the large adjusting screw.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. Perikon Detector Elements.]\n\nThe Perikon detector gives excellent results without a battery and is\npreferably used in that manner. If a battery is used, a potentiometer to\nlower the voltage is necessary.\n\nWhen adjusting this or the carborundum detector where a battery is used,\nthe pressure must be very carefully regulated until it is found to be\nthe best. When the pressure is light the signals in the phones are due\nto an imperfect contact, and when it is slightly increased the\nrectifying properties of the crystal are brought into play.\n\nThe Perikon detector illustrated in Fig. 110 is somewhat similar to that\nused for commercial work.\n\nThe standards or posts supporting the cups which contain the elements\nare brass rods 1/2 inch square and 1 1/2 inches high. A hole is bored in\nthe bottom of each and threaded with an 8-32 tap to receive a machine\nscrew which passes through the base and holds them in an upright\nposition. A hole is bored 1 1/8 inches from the bottom, in the face of\none standard and threaded with an 8-32 tap. A brass rod 1 1/4 inches\nlong, carrying at one end a cup 1 inch in diameter and 3/8 inch deep, is\nthreaded to fit in the hole in the standard. The zincite is mounted in\nthis cup.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Perikon Detector.]\n\nThe other standard is cut in half with a hack saw and a 1/8-inch hole\nbored 1/4 inch deep in the axis of each piece. A pin, 1/2 inch long, is\nset in the lower half by soldering it in the hole. The upper half of the\nstandard is placed over the pin and left free to move when twisted. A\n1/8-inch brass tube, 1 inch long, passes through the upper part of the\nstandard. A 1/8-inch brass rod, 1 3/4 inches long, passes through the\ntube.\n\nThe small cup containing the zincite is mounted on one end of the rod\nand a hard rubber handle on the other.\n\nA brass spring is placed between the cup and the standard in order to\npress the chalcopyrites against the zincite. The cup is mounted out of\ncenter so that by revolving it and twisting the standard at the same\ntime the chalcopyrites may be brought into contact with any portion of\nthe zincite. By screwing the rod supporting the zincite cup in or out of\nthe standard the pressure with which the two elements are pressed\ntogether may be regulated.\n\nThe base of the detector is hard rubber of the dimensions indicated in\nthe illustration. Four binding posts on each corner of the base are\nnecessary. The detector is connected in a similar manner to the silicon\ndetector shown in Fig. 108. If a battery is used the circuit should be\nlike that of the \"bare point\" electrolytic, and the current must flow\nfrom the zincite to the chalcopyrites.\n\n\n\nLEAD PEROXIDE DETECTOR.\n\n\nThe peroxide of lead detector makes use of no liquids, but still may be\nclassed as an electrolytic since its action is of that nature.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. Peroxide of Lead Detector.]\n\nIt consists of a pellet of lead peroxide held between an electrode of\nlead and one of platinum. Contrary to most other detectors, the\nresistance is increased upon the passage of electrical oscillations. The\noscillations stimulate chemical action and increase a\ncounter-electromotive force sufficiently so that a decrease in the\ncurrent sent through the phones by the local battery takes place. The\naction may be outlined more in detail as follows. The current of the\nlocal battery decomposes part of the lead peroxide into its components,\nlead and oxygen. The lead ions are positively electrified and so they\ntend to pass upward toward the lead electrode which is negative. The\nnegative ions of oxygen gas tend to pass downwards towards the platinum.\nBut the lead and platinum electrodes with the intervening lead peroxide\nconstitute a small cell acting independently of the local battery and\nsending a current in the opposite direction. This counter-electromotive\nforce tends to send the ions in an opposite direction to that in which\nthey are sent by the battery current. Upon the passage of electrical\noscillations this counter electromotive force is increased and\nsufficient ions sent out in opposition to those of the battery current\nso that an appreciable drop in the current flowing through the telephone\nreceivers takes place. The sudden current drop produces a sound in the\nreceivers.\n\nThe lead pellets may be secured from a druggist who can mold them in his\ntablet press. They should be subjected to as great a pressure as\npossible in order to reduce resistance and prevent crumbling.\n\nA piece of platinum foil about 1/2 inch square is placed beneath the\npellet on the crystal electrode. A piece of clean, bright sheet lead 3/8\ninch in diameter and 1/8 inch thick is laid on the pellet and the whole\nclamped together by tightening the thumbscrew passing through the collar\non the spring, _S_. The detector is connected up similar to the \"bare\npoint,\" The platinum is made the positive of the local battery.\nAdjustment is secured by regulating the pressure.\n\nIt is very necessary that the pellets be kept dry, as otherwise a loud\nsinging and hissing noise, due to the decomposition of the water, will\nrender the reception of signals very difficult.\n\n\n\nTHE MARCONI MAGNETIC DETECTOR.\n\n\nWhen an oscillatory discharge takes place through a coil of wire\nsurrounding a needle, it magnetizes the needle in a totally different\nmanner from a voltaic current. The needle will have several poles\nthroughout its length, many of them reversed. Rutherford applied this\nphenomenon to the detection of electrical oscillations, but it remained\nfor Marconi to improve it and give the magnetic detector its existing\nform. This type of detector is very sensitive, free from all adjustment\nand is not made inoperative by the heavier discharge of the transmitter\nduring each period of sending.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Marconi Magnetic Detector.]\n\nA small transformer is provided with a core composed of a band or cord\nof iron wires in the form of an endless belt which passes around two\npulleys kept in motion by a clockwork motor. The band revolves in the\nfield of a strong horseshoe magnet and passes directly over the poles\nafter issuing from the transformer bobbin, so that the portion\napproaching the bobbin are constantly in a state of increasing\nmagnetism. The actual operation is based upon the property of iron\ncalled hysteresis, for the magnetism of the core lags behind that of the\npermanent magnet and is of a different degree from what it ought to be,\nin view of its position in the vicinity of the permanent magnet. The\nmoment the oscillations pass through the primary coil of the\ntransformer, this lag is set free and the magnetism assumes its full\nvalue. The change in magnetism induces a current in the secondary, which\nregisters as a sound in the telephone receivers.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. Details of Transformer.]\n\nThe primary coil is made up of a single layer of No. 36 B. S. gauge silk\ncovered wire wound on a thin walled glass or hard rubber tube. The ends\nof the tube, which is 2 inches long and 1/4 inch external diameter, are\nslightly flared so as not to chafe the band. The primary is thoroughly\nshellacked and covered with a single layer of paper.\n\nThe secondary is also of No. 36 B. S. silk covered wire and is wound\nbetween two disks of hard rubber, 1/4 inch thick and 1 1/2 inches in\ndiameter, placed 3/8 inch apart in the center of the secondary and the\nintervening space wound full of wire.\n\nThe terminals of both the primary and secondary are extended to binding\nposts mounted on the case of the instrument.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Method of Joining Ends of Band.]\n\nThe core or revolving band is made by winding 100 strands of No. 36 silk\ncovered soft iron wire between two small pegs, placed a distance apart,\nequal to twice the circumference of the oval formed by the two pulleys.\nThe wire is all wound in the same direction. It should be carefully\nremoved from the pegs and kept taut while it is slightly twisted,\ndoubled, and then further twisted into a rope or cord. The ends are\nthreaded together with a separate piece of insulated wire, into a link\nwhich will pass easily through the primary tube.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 115. Pulley.]\n\nThe pulleys around which the band revolves are made of hard wood. They\nare 4 inches in diameter and 3/8 inch thick and have a V-shaped groove\ncut in the edge. In order to minimize friction and wear, it is advisable\nto fit them with a bearing which may be made out of brass tubing and a\ncouple of washers. One of the pulleys is geared to a clockwork motor so\nthat the band makes a complete revolution about once every two minutes.\nAn old eight day clock may be adapted for this purpose, or, what is much\nbetter, the motor from an old phonograph.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. Pulley Bearings.]\n\nThe horseshoe magnet is mounted with its north pole pointing towards and\nnearly touching the middle of the outside of the secondary. The south\npole is placed opposite the end of the primary tube which is on the side\ntowards which the band is revolving, that is, the band in revolving\npasses first over the north pole and then over the south. Two magnets\nare sometimes used with their north poles together in the center of the\nsecondary, and a south pole opposite each end of the primary tube.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. Circuit of Magnetic Detector.]\n\nThe commercial instrument is placed in a glass covered case which\nprotects it from dust and injury. The clockwork motor is concealed in\nthe lower part of the case. This is a good plan but an experimental\ndetector may be merely mounted on a flat wooden base as illustrated in\nFig. 112.\n\nThe secondary terminals are connected directly to the telephone\nreceivers while the primary leads to the aerial and the ground. When the\ndetector is started up it should make a very slight hissing sound in the\ntelephone receivers as the band passes slowly through the coils. This\nshows the instrument to be in good working order and ready for the\nreception of signals.\n\n*The Audion.*\u2014Dr. Lee DeForest was led by the flickering of a sensitive\ngas flame to investigate whether or not it would respond to Hertzian\nvibrations as well as to those of heat and sound. His experiments led to\nthe invention of the audion, a peculiar instrument making use of ionized\ngas for its operation.\n\nThe audion consists of an incandescent lamp having a metallic filament,\non either side of which are a grid and a plate made of nickel. When the\nfilament is lighted it throws off ions which act as a relay to high\nfrequency oscillations passing between the plate and the grid. A\nproperly constructed audion is exceedingly sensitive and produces very\nloud tones in the telephone receivers. It has the further advantages of\nentire absence of adjustment except the governing of the battery\nvoltage, and is capable of extremely fine tuning.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 118. Fleming Oscillation Valve.]\n\nFleming originated the oscillation valve illustrated in Fig. 118. It\nconsists of an ordinary incandescent lamp with a carbon filament, having\na metal cylinder, _C_, placed around the filament, but attached to an\nindependently insulated platinum wire sealed in the glass. When the lamp\nis lighted by passing a current through the filament, the incandescent\ncarbon liberates negative ions. If oscillations are then set up in a\ncircuit which includes a pair of sensitive telephone receivers and is\nformed by connecting the negative terminal of the filament with the\nplatinum cylinder, negative electricity will be enabled to pass from the\nfilament to the cylinder but not in the opposite direction, and so\nsounds will be produced in the telephone receivers. High frequency\noscillations themselves could not be made to pass through the telephone\nreceivers because of the choking action of the iron cores of the\nelectromagnets.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. Flame Audion.]\n\nThe simple but sensitive form of detector illustrated in Fig. 119 is not\nof practical value for commercial work, but is very interesting as the\nprogenitor of the audion, and provides a good field for amateur\ninvestigation. Its only drawback is that the gas flame is very difficult\nto keep steady and every flicker registers as a sound in the telephone\nreceivers.\n\nA Bunsen burner using coal gas furnishes the flame, and a salt of an\nalkaline metal heated in the flame, the ions. The hydroxides of caesium,\npotassium and sodium give the best results in the order named.\n\nThe salt is contained in a piece of trough-shaped platinum foil, about\n3/8 inch long and 1/16 inch wide. This trough is made the cathode or\nnegative of the telephone circuit and placed in the outer oxidizing\nflame just above its juncture with the interior reducing flame and must\nbe kept incandescent. The upper electrode or anode is a piece of\nplatinum wire about 1/16 inch above the trough.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. Circuit of Flame Audion.]\n\nThe arrangement and construction of the detector is clearly indicated by\nthe drawing so that it is unnecessary to go into details. The block,\n_E_, which fits on the tube of the Bunsen burner, is made of fiber. Two\ndouble binding posts, _D_, are fastened to _E_ to support the rods, _R_,\nwhich are fitted at the tops with binding posts, _B_, into which the\nelectrodes may be clamped.\n\nTwelve dry cells are connected with a multiple point switch so that an\nelectromotive force of 6-18 volts, varying in steps of one cell at a\ntime, may be secured. The flame is best provided with a mica chimney to\nprotect it from drafts. By keeping plenty of salt in the trough and\ncarefully adjusting the voltage, this detector may be made marvelously\nsensitive.\n\n    \u00b3 The different detectors in order of their sensitiveness are\n      electrolytic, perikon, magnetic, silicon, carborundum.\n\n    \u2074 Peacock ore or bornite, which consists of about 60 parts of\n      copper, 14 parts of iron and 26 parts of sulphur, may be\n      substituted for the chalcopyrites with excellent results.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. TUNING COILS AND TRANSFORMERS.\n\n\nA tuning coil is merely a variable inductance wound in single layer on a\nsuitable form.\n\nFig. 121 illustrates a double slide tuner. The base is a piece of hard\nwood, 12 inches long, 1 inch thick and 5 1/2 inches wide. Two wooden\nheads 4 x 4 x 3/4 inches support the form upon which the coil is wound.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 121. Double-slide Tuning Coil.]\n\nThe form is a piece of wooden curtain pole, 9 inches long and 3 inches\nin diameter. Some may prefer to use a cardboard tube in place of the\ncurtain pole. A tube can be made by winding a long strip of cardboard 9\ninches wide around a suitable form and cementing the layers together\nwith shellac. The liberal use of shellac will stiffen the tube and cause\nit to better retain its shape. The tube is held tightly between the two\nheads by means of a brass rod which passes through the center and is\nclamped by two nuts.\n\nA square brass rod 10 1/2 inches long is fastened to the center of the\ntop of the heads and a similar rod to the center of the front face.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. Sliders.]\n\nFig. 122 shows two forms of sliders. The first one is the better and to\nbe preferred. A short square brass tube, _S_, fits snugly upon the\nsquare brass rod, _R_. It cannot turn around but is free to slide back\nand forth. A strip of spring brass, _C_, is soldered to the lower face\nof the square tube. It is bent in a double turn and a punch mark made\nnear the lower end as shown in the illustration. The indentation is made\nwith a center punch, but should not be deep enough to break through the\nmetal.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. Double-slide Tuning Coil Circuits.]\n\nThe little projection on the under side of _C_ caused by the punch mark\nis the only part of the slider which should make contact with the wire\non the tuning coil. It should slide easily but firmly along the wires\nand touch only one at a time. Long distance signals will be considerably\nweakened if the slider touches more than one wire at a time and\nshort-circuits a turn.\n\n[Illustration: *Plate IV. Receiving Circuits. (Straightaway Aerial.)*]\n\nThe slider, _B_, is similar to _A_ except that it has a short length of\nbrass tubing, _T_, soldered to the under side of _S_ in place of the\nbrass strip, _C_. A small ball bearing which just fits the bore of the\ntube is pushed down into contact with the wire by means of a small\nspiral spring inside of the tube. Both sliders are fitted with a hard\nrubber handle so that they may be adjusted without the ringers coming\ninto contact with the metal.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. Murdock Double-slide Tuning Coil.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. United Wireless Receiving Set.]\n\nTwo good circuits employing the double slide tuner are given in Fig.\n123. Plates IV and V illustrate the oscillation or tuning circuits of\nthe most prominent receptor systems.\n\nIf a loop aerial is used, more than one tuning coil is necessary as\nshown by the loop aerial oscillation circuits in Plate V.\n\nFigs. 125 and 126 illustrate the instruments employed for receiving by\nthe United Wireless Company.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 126. United Wireless Portable Receiving Set.]\n\nIn Fig. 125 the handles which are attached to the sliders of the tuning\ncoils project through long slots cut in the top and one side of the\ncabinet.\n\nThe tuning coils in the portable outfit are mounted in a vertical\nposition in back of the aerial switch.\n\n*Loosely Coupled Tuning Coil.*\u2014By the use of a loosely coupled receiving\ntuner or transformer, the range of a station is considerably increased,\nas is also the strength of the signals, and much finer tuning and\nselectivity made possible.\n\nFig. 127 illustrates the construction of such an oscillation\ntransformer.\n\nThe base is wood and measures 14 x 5 1/2 x 1 inches. The primary winding\nis wound on a cardboard or fiber tube 4 1/4 inches long, having an\ninternal diameter of 2 3/4 inches and an external diameter of 3 inches.\nThe heads, _L_ and _M_, are the same size as those of the double slide\ntuning coil. The head, _L_, has a circular hole 2 3/4 inches in diameter\ncut in the center in order to permit the secondary coil to slide in and\nout of the primary.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. Oscillation Transformer.]\n\nThe secondary coil is a piece of round curtain pole 2 1/2 inches in\ndiameter and 3 inches long. A 5/16-inch hole is bored through its axis.\nThe head, _K_, of the secondary coil is 3 3/4 x 3 3/4 x 3/4 inches. A\nten-point switch on _K_ is so connected that it divides the secondary\ninto ten equal parts and permits any number of the divisions to be used\nas desired.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 128. United Wireless Receiving Transformer.]\n\nA wooden post, _J_, 2 1/2 inches high and 1 1/4 inches wide, supports\none end of a 1/4-inch brass rod upon which the secondary slides back and\nforth.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 129. Details of Receiving Transformer.]\n\nNo. 24 B. S. gauge copper wire may be used for winding both the primary\nand secondary. It is also the proper size to use on the double slide\ntuner. The best method is to use bare wire, wound with a thread so that\na thread is interposed between adjacent turns of the winding. Give the\nwhole winding one or two coats of thick shellac and allow it to harden.\nThen use a strip of sandpaper to remove the shellac in a long narrow\npath immediately below the sliders so that they may make contact with\nthe wire.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 130. Slider for Loose Coupler.]\n\nSome may prefer to make a loosely coupled tuner in which the inductance\nof both coils is adjustable by means of a sliding contact. In such a\ncase the slider on the secondary coil must be constructed as illustrated\nin Fig. 130. The contact is long and narrow so that it can touch the\ninnermost turns, when placed within the primary. By slipping the slider\noff the end of the rod and reversing it, the contact can be made to\ntouch the turns next to the head. The square brass rod is set in a notch\ncut in the coil head so that the rod is flush with the top.\n\nWhen tuning a receiving transformer, place both variable condensers in a\nhalfway position and adjust the sliding contacts, first on the primary\nand then on the secondary, until the signals are the loudest. Then\nadjust the condensers.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 131. Loosely Coupled Tuning Circuits.]\n\nTo cut out an undesirable station, vary the coupling between the two\ncoils by sliding the secondary away from the primary. When several turns\non the secondary seem to give the same results also vary the coupling.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 132. Combination Loosely and Closely Coupled Tuner.]\n\nFig. 132 illustrates the wiring diagram of a combination loosely and\nclosely coupled tuner. Two sliding contacts are placed on the primary\ncoil of the receiving transformer and connected with a double pole\ndouble throw switch as in the diagram. When the switch is thrown on\ncontacts 1 and 2, the primary is connected to the detector as a double\nslide tuner, and when on 3 and 4 both the primary and secondary are\nbrought into use as a transformer.\n\nThis arrangement may seem cumbersome and is recommended only as a\nconvenience in experimenting. A loosely coupled tuning coil is capable\nof exact tuning, and unless one understands how to use it, he may not\nhear a station because the tuner is not properly adjusted. By using the\ndouble slide tuner first and then throwing the switch so as to tune in\non the transformer, this difficulty may be eliminated.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. Clapp-Eastham Loose Coupler.]\n\n*Potentiometer.*\u2014A potentiometer is not properly classed under the\nheading of tuning coils, but the construction may be made so similar\nthat it well appears here.\n\nThe potentiometer is merely a variable resistance shunted across the\nterminals of the detector battery in the manner illustrated in the\nnumerous detector circuits. It is used to reduce the voltage of the\nbattery to a value slightly below the critical voltage of the detector.\nThe critical voltage of a detector is the voltage at which its action\ncommences. In the case of an electrolytic detector, it is the voltage\nrequired to break down the thin film of gas which collects on the \"bare\npoint.\"\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 134. A Highly Efficient Form of Loose Coupler.]\n\nIn construction, the potentiometer illustrated in Fig. 135 is in reality\na small edition of a double slide tuning coil. It is wound with No. 28\nB. S. gauge German silver wire. Three binding posts are mounted on the\nbase, two of them connecting with the ends of the coil and one with the\nsliding contact.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 135. Potentiometer.]\n\nIn a finely balanced circuit where long distance work and close tuning\nare desired, the potentiometer must be non-inductive.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 136. Amco Potentiometer.]\n\nThis may be accomplished by using two potentiometers wound in opposite\ndirections from one another and connected in series. The two terminals\nof the windings are then connected across the battery and the sliding\ncontacts led to the detector.\n\n[Illustration: *Plate V. Receiving Circuits.*]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. RECEIVING CONDENSERS.\n\n\nCondensers play an important part in tuning and adjusting the receiving\ncircuits of a wireless telegraph station. They are inserted in the\ncircuits for various purposes. In some places a small condenser shunts\nthe detector to somewhat equalize any small changes in capacity which\nmight occur in the detector and throw the circuit out of tune. In other\ncases where selectivity is desired they provide a path for undesirable\noscillations and allow them to flow into the ground without passing\nthrough the detector. Wherever the double slide tuner or the Fessenden\nsingle slider circuit is used, a condenser must be inserted in the\ncircuit to prevent the wire of the tuning coil from short-circuiting the\ntelephone receivers and battery.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 137. Tuning Circuit with and without an Adjustable\nCondenser.]\n\nThe value of a condenser may be readily appreciated by the following\nexperiment. Connect up a detector according to the diagram shown by _A_\nof Fig. 137. This circuit will give good results and the signals will be\nclear. But change it to that shown in _B_, by connecting one side of a\nvariable condenser to the upper contact of the tuning coil and leading\nthe other side to the ground. Considerable selectivity may now be\nattained and the signals will be 50 per cent louder.\n\nTo be of any value for a receiving circuit the capacity of the condenser\nmust be adjustable, but there are many places where a fixed condenser is\nof service.\n\nThe average capacity of such condensers generally ranges around .003 of\na microfarad, but cannot be predetermined, as it depends upon many\nfactors which vary greatly in different stations. Even if specific\ndimensions were given for the construction of a paper condenser of\nstated capacity, the experimenter would very seldom succeed in\nconstructing his condenser and have it of this value when finished. The\npaper used as the dielectric and the pressure applied to the condenser\nwould make the difference.\n\nThe best plan is to build one up in the form of a roll as follows. Three\nthin tin foil strips 3 1/2 inches wide and four feet long are separated\nby strips of thin paraffined paper 4 inches wide and four and one-half\nfeet long. The two outside strips of tin foil are connected together and\nform one terminal of the condenser. The middle strip of tin foil is the\nother. The outside strips of tin foil are covered with paraffined paper\nand the whole rolled up. If thin paper and tin foil are used the\ncondenser will form a roll 4 inches long and less than an inch in\ndiameter.\n\nTwo or three such condensers should be constructed, and one of them\nconnected up in the circuit where it is desirable to use it. By\nunrolling a little of the condenser and cutting one or two inches off at\na time the proper size may be determined.\n\nAs explained in Chapter VII, two equal condensers connected in series\nhave one-half the capacity of either. By connecting them in parallel the\ncapacity is the sum of the two. In this manner it is not hard to first\nfind the approximate capacity, which gives the best results before\ncutting the condenser.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 138. Tubular Condenser.]\n\nWhen the proper value is found, place the condenser in a brass tube\nabout 5 inches long and 1 inch in diameter. The tube is fitted with hard\nrubber flanges to close the ends. A binding post is mounted on each\nflange, and connects with the terminal of the condenser to which it is\nnearest.\n\nMounting a condenser in this manner gives it a much better appearance\nand it occupies less space than otherwise. Fixed condensers are used in\ntwo cases only, to shunt the condenser and to prevent the tuning coil\nfrom short-circuiting the telephone receivers. In any other position\nthey are worthless.\n\n*Variable Condensers.*\u2014A simple form of adjustable condenser which may\nbe quickly made for a special experiment is constructed in the following\nmanner. A wooden curtain pole 2 inches in diameter and 18 inches long is\ncovered with a layer of tin foil. The tin foil must be laid on smoothly\nand cemented with shellac. A layer of paraffined paper is then placed\nover the tin foil. A piece of sheet copper or tin 6 3/4 inches wide and\n18 inches long is rolled up in a cylinder to fit over the rod with its\ntin foil and paper. The rod is fastened at one end to a base board about\n20 inches long and 4 inches wide, by means of a bracket, or it may be\nmounted on a smaller base in a vertical position.\n\nConnections are made to the tin foil and to the outside metal tube. By\nsliding the tube back and forth on the rod the condenser may be given a\nvariable capacity.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 139. Variable Condenser.]\n\nThe best variable condensers are constructed so that the dielectric\nbetween the two plates is formed by air. There are consequently no\nlosses of energy in the condenser, for this mode of construction\neliminates all dielectric hysteresis.\n\nFig. 139 shows such a variable condenser and Fig. 140 the details. It is\npossible to do very close, selective tuning with this instrument. The\nefficiency of the receiving circuit may be considerably improved if one\nis used wherever a condenser is required.\n\nA rectangular box is built up in the manner shown in Fig. 135. The\nsides, _D_, are 6 inches long, 4 11/16 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick.\nThe top, _A_, is 6 inches long, 1 13/16 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick.\nThe bottom, _B_, has the same width and thickness but is 11 inches long.\nEleven grooves are cut in _A_ and _B_ as shown in the cross section. The\ngrooves are 1/16 inch wide, 3/16 inch deep and 1/16 inch apart. They are\nformed by setting the blade of a circular saw so that it projects 3/16\ninch above the table or bed. After cutting one groove, the guide is\nmoved 1/8 inch and another cut made.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 140. Details of Variable Condenser.]\n\nEleven metal plates, _P_, are required, six fixed and five movable. They\nare made of No. 22 gauge sheet brass and measure 4 x 6 inches. Six of\nthem are placed in the grooves in the box in such a manner that an empty\ngroove is left between each one. The six plates are then electrically\nconnected together by soldering a strip of brass across their rear ends.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 141. Sliding Plate Variable Condenser.]\n\nFive slots each 1/4 inch deep and 1/4 inch apart are made with a hack\nsaw in a piece of brass, _C_, 1 1/2 inches long, 3/4 inch wide and 1/2\ninch thick. A small pin 1/2 inch long is set in the center of _C_ on the\nopposite side from the saw cuts. A fiber handle 1/2 inch in diameter and\n1 1/2 inches long is fastened to the pin.\n\nThe five movable brass plates are set in the grooves between the six\nfixed plates. They are allowed to project three or four inches out of\nthe box. The yoke, _C_, is then soldered across the ends so that each\none of the movable plates fits into its corresponding saw cut.\n\nThe capacity of the condenser is varied by sliding the movable plates\nback and forth between the fixed plates.\n\nA binding post is soldered to the yoke, _C_, and another one to the\nstrip which holds the fixed plates together. Connections are made to the\nbinding posts with lamp cord or some other flexible conductor which will\nnot interfere with the movement of the plates.\n\nThe instrument is finished by staining the woodwork and giving it a coat\nof varnish or shellac.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. TELEPHONE RECEIVERS AND HEADBANDS.\n\n\nA pair of high resistance telephone receivers in nice adjustment\nconstitute one of the most sensitive electrical instruments in existence\nand will detect an exceedingly weak current.\n\nThe only type of receiver of much service in wireless telegraphy is that\nknown as a watch case or pony receiver. It is small and compact so that\nit may be attached to a headband and clamped against the ear.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 142. Types of Permanent Magnets.]\n\nThe permanent magnets of a watch-case receiver are usually in the form\nof either a ring or a horseshoe as shown by Fig. 142. The first form has\n\"consequent\" poles and is considered somewhat superior to the horseshoe,\nsince the lines of force are not so liable to pass across the pole\npieces before they pass through the electromagnets and the diaphragm.\n\nThe ordinary low resistance telephone receiver is perfectly well suited\nto the telephone work for which it was designed and adjusted, and will\ngive good service on a wireless receptor for short distances, but can be\nconsiderably improved by following the suggestions and instructions\ngiven below.\n\nThe principal objection to the ordinary receiver is that it does not\ncontain enough turns of wire on its bobbins. This is easily remedied by\ncarefully rewinding them with a very fine silk covered, pure copper\nmagnet wire no larger than No. 40 B. S. gauge. This will increase the\nnumber of turns and also the resistance, but it must not be inferred\nthat resistance is to be desired. This is a common impression of\namateurs who do not understand the underlying principle, that the\nstrength of an electromagnet varies directly as the number of turns of\nwire, multiplied by the amperes flowing through the magnet. When a\ntelephone receiver is wound with a finer wire the resistance is\nincreased, cutting down both the current and the strength of the magnet.\nBut if pure copper wire is used, and the winding not carried beyond the\npoint where the circumference of the outside layer becomes twice as\ngreat as the circumference of the first layer, the number of turns\nincreases faster than the resistance and the magnet strength is\nconsiderably greater than before the receiver was rewound.\n\nNo. 40 B. S. gauge silk covered wire is often used for this purpose, but\nthe best results are obtained with enameled covered wire of the same\nsize. It is possible to wind almost three times as much of the enameled\nwire on a telephone bobbin as silk wire of the same size. The difference\nis due to the thickness of the insulation. An ordinary double pole\nwatch-case receiver will have a resistance of 800-1,000 ohms when wound\nwith silk covered wire and 1,500-1,800 ohms when wound with enameled\nwire.\n\nTo rewind a telephone receiver, first unscrew the cap and remove the\ndiaphragm, then remove the bobbins by unloosening the screws with the\naid of a screw driver. Unwind the old wire and examine the empty bobbins\nto see that wherever the wire is liable to come into contact with the\nmetal that it is well insulated with paraffined paper or some other\nequally good material. Then wind the new wire on in smooth even layers\nand when it is completed fasten the bobbins back on the permanent\nmagnets and connect them up. The current should flow through in opposite\ndirections so that the north pole of one and the south pole of the other\nis on top. Do not trust splice connections but solder them using acid as\na flux.\n\nThe Navy Department specifies that its wireless receivers shall be wound\nwith copper wire of not less than 0.0015 inch in diameter and the\ndiaphragm to have a diameter of 1 3/4 inches and a thickness of 0.004\ninch. The resistance of the coils is specified at 1,000-1,100 ohms.\nThere is not much advantage in greatly exceeding the number of turns\npossible with this winding, for to obtain them a much finer wire than\nNo. 40 B. S. gauge is necessary and the ratio between resistance and\nturns becomes greater.\n\nThe second objection to the ordinary receiver is that the diaphragms are\nvery often too thick. A receiver having a thin diaphragm is preferable\nbecause when a weak current is sent through the coils, the change in\nmagnet strength is greater. But this may be carried to excess and the\ndiaphragm made so thin that it cannot absorb sufficient lines of force\nto properly play its part. The best thickness then for a diaphragm can\nonly be determined experimentally and depends much upon the diameter.\nThe distance from the poles and the strength of the magnets will also\nhave considerable bearing on the thickness. The ordinary phone will be\nvery sensitive and give clear tones with diaphragms ranging from\n.01-.004 inch.\n\nThe relation between the thickness and the diameter is shown by the\nfollowing: If the diaphragm of a receiver is increased in diameter, the\ntones will become more distinct, but if the increase is carried too far\nthey will become indistinct and the only remedy is to thicken the\ndiaphragm. Likewise if after clearness is secured the diaphragm is\nthickened so that the tones again become indistinct, the diameter must\nbe increased.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 143. Grinding Tool.]\n\nThe third objection is that such receivers are not carefully and\nproperly adjusted. The adjustment is also a matter of experiment and is\naccomplished by comparison of the receiver in question with one which is\nknown to be in a sensitive condition. The adjusting may be done by means\nof the tool shown in Fig. 143.\n\nThis tool is made from an ordinary file by grinding off the teeth on one\nside save for a distance of about 3/4 inch in the middle. The grinding\nmay be done on an emery wheel. The part (_a_) is used for filing the\npole pieces and thus making the distance between them and the diaphragm\ngreater. The tool has the advantage over an ordinary file of permitting\nthe poles to be filed without removal from the receiver and without\ngrooving the diaphragm bed or the receiver case.\n\nTo lessen the distance between the poles and the diaphragm, lay the\nreceiver bed downward on a piece of fine emery paper and rub with a\ncircular scouring motion. If the emery paper is placed on a perfectly\nflat surface no trouble will be experienced in grinding the bed down\nevenly.\n\nWhen filing the pole pieces rub with the same circular motion so as to\ngrind off all sides evenly. Test from time to time by passing a straight\nedge over the bed in all directions while holding to the light and\nlooking between the straight edge and the poles. In this manner the\ndistance separating the diaphragm and the poles may be gauged and\nwhether or not it is the same on all sides. Bear in mind that if the\ndiaphragm is thin, the attraction of the permanent magnets will cause it\nto bend in towards the poles.\n\nIn case you have a pair of receivers built for wireless work, which\nappear to be in good condition but do not give their former results, the\nlast thing to do is to tamper with the adjustment. The most common\ncause, when the tones are impaired, is dirt or dust accumulated on the\npoles or diaphragm and damping its vibration. The cap should be\ncarefully unscrewed and the diaphragm examined to see if it is bent. If\nso, replace with a new one of the same size. Remove any dirt or filings,\nand if the diaphragm is rusty clean it by laying it on a flat surface\nand rubbing it with a piece of fine emery paper. Then give it a thin\ncoat of colorless lacquer. Examine the magnets and pole pieces to see if\nthey have become loosened and if so tighten them.\n\nOr the trouble may be that the permanent magnets have lost part of their\nmagnetism, and almost any receiver which has been in use for some length\nof time will bear having its magnets strengthened. If they are found to\nbe weak they should be removed and remagnetized. This is accomplished by\nwinding a coil of No. 18 B. S. gauge wire around them and sending a\nheavy direct current through for a few minutes.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 144. Parts of a Holtzer Cabot Receiver.]\n\nIn carrying out any of these suggestions remember to work with one\nreceiver at a time, keeping the other for comparison, so that by\nrepeated tests you may tell whether or not an improvement is being made\nand when well enough is reached, let it alone.\n\nFig. 144 shows the construction of a telephone receiver manufactured by\nthe Holtzer Cabot Co. of Brookline, Mass. The permanent magnets and\nbobbins are mounted in a metal cup, _B_, which supports the diaphragm,\n_A_. The metal cup is enclosed in a hard rubber shell, _C_, and fitted\nwith a cap, _D_.\n\nThe complete receivers are mounted on an adjustable headband and fitted\nwith pneumatic ear cushions which make them set more comfortably and\nshut out extraneous noise. These receivers are wound to all resistances\nused in the wireless field but, for the experimenter, those having a\nresistance of 1000 ohms apiece will give the best all around results.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 145. Holtzer Cabot Head Set.]\n\nIt is very desirable that the receivers should be fitted with a\ncomfortable headband which will hold the telephones in close adjustment\nto the ears. Fig. 146 shows the construction of such a band.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 146. Adjustable Head Band.]\n\nTwo brass straps, 1 inch wide, 12 inches long and 1/16 inch thick are\nnecessary. Two 1/8-inch holes, _mm_, are bored in them 3/16 inch from\none end and the end bent up at an angle along a line 3/8 inch from the\nend as shown by the drawing. A cover is made for the straps, by sewing\ntwo strips of leather 1 1/4 inches wide and 12 inches long, together\nalong their edges. The covers may then be slipped over the straps. Two\n1/16-inch brass strips, 3/8 inch wide and a little longer than one-half\nthe circumference of the watch-case receiver to be fitted to the head\nband, are bent into stirrups as shown in the illustration by _Y_. The\nends of the stirrups are fitted with two pivots, _PP_, which are riveted\nin a hole. Two holes or recesses are bored in the shell of each\nreceiver, on the sides 180 degrees apart. The pivots, _PP_, fit into\nthese holes and form bearings in which the receivers can turn and adjust\nthemselves to the ears. The stirrup has two small holes, _hh_, bored 3/8\ninch apart at the top and tapped to receive a small screw. The screws\npass through the holes, _mm_, and hold the stirrups at the end of their\nrespective strap.\n\nThe leather-covered straps are bound together by means of two clamps\nwhich permit the head band to be adjusted to suit the wearer. The\nclamps, _C_, are made from 1/16-inch brass 3/8 inch wide. Their form and\nconstruction may be best understood from the drawing. A small screw eye\nis cut in half and soldered to the center of the upper side of the clamp\nso that the receiver cord may be passed through the eyelet, _E_.\n\nThe telephone receivers should be connected in series by means of a\nflexible telephone cord.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. OPERATION.\n\n\nThe first essential in order to manage a wireless station, after\nlearning the construction and handling of the instruments, is to acquire\na thorough knowledge of the telegraph codes.\n\nThe two codes in use in wireless service are the Morse and the\nContinental. They are given below.\n\nIn some cases, the intending wireless operator has had some experience\nwith a Morse sounder and then it is merely a matter of transition and of\naccustoming the ear to a new sound. However it is always best to learn\nthe Morse code first as Continental is merely an adaptation in which no\nspace characters appear.\n\nA beginner may learn to receive most easily by communicating with\nanother person to whom it is also new. They should first memorize all\nthe letters of the code and practice transmitting before commencing any\ncommunication.\n\nIt is a great mistake for a beginner to start by writing down the dots\nand dashes as he receives them on paper. He should make an effort to\ntranslate them and set the characters and words down directly. This at\nfirst will sacrifice speed but will make a better operator and enable\none to become proficient sooner than if he begins otherwise.\n\nIn case two complete sets of wireless apparatus are not convenient, one\nmay learn to read from a buzzer connected to a key and a battery. The\nsignals may be read directly from the sound of the buzzer itself, but if\na pair of telephone receivers are connected across the terminals, a\nsound will be produced in the phones similar to that of a wireless\nreceptor.\n\nIn sending, avoid a short, choppy or jerky style and handle the key with\na light but firm touch. Keep the dots and dashes firm and of the proper\nrelative length, as also the spaces between letters and words.\n\nThe following suggestions and instructions adapted from the Rules and\nRegulations governing Naval Wireless Telegraph Stations may be of value\nand service to many in operating their instruments.\n\n\"The operating room should be well lighted and free from vibration. The\nroom should have a well insulated entrance for the aerial and should be\nfitted with an operating table about two and one-half feet wide, not\nless than seven feet long and of a convenient height for working the\nsending key.\n\nThe table should be of dry, well-seasoned wood and the instruments\nshould be mounted on the table at safe sparking distances from each\nother.\n\n\"The connections should all be as direct as possible and well insulated.\nHigh potential leads should be kept away from low potential leads and\nwhere they cross it should be at nearly right angles.\n\n\"Sending key contacts must be kept clean and flat with surfaces parallel\nto each other.\n\n\"All sliding contacts, especially in the receiving tuning coils, should\nbe kept clean and bright and free from foreign matter. A sending set\nworking at low power with all connections good, closed and open circuits\nin resonance, no sparking from edge of condenser, jar or plates, no glow\nfrom aerial and no sparking to rigging, is utilizing its power much more\nefficiently than the same set pushed to the limit with high resistance\nconnections, sparking at all points and out of resonance.\"\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 147. Marconi Station at Siasconset, Mass.]\n\nIt is a good plan for any amateur to keep a note book in which he can\nrecord the various distances he has been able to receive and transmit.\nHe should try more than one circuit and jot down the results. It is then\npossible to bring a station up to an efficiency which cannot be reached\nin any other manner.\n\n\n\nELECTRICAL TERMS AND DEFINITIONS.\n\n\n_Accumulator:_\n       A cell whose positive and negative electrodes are formed or\n       deposited by a current flowing from a separate source.\n\n_Aerial:_\n       A network or a number of wires insulated from surrounding objects\n       and suspended in the air to emit or intercept electromagnetic\n       waves.\n\n_Alternating Current:_\n       An electric current, of which the direction of flow reverses a\n       number of times per second.\n\n_Ampere:_\n       The quantity of current which will flow through a resistance of\n       one ohm under a potential of one volt.

WHAT IT IS; HOW TO\nCOMPLY; HOW TO SECURE A LICENSE.\n\n\nOn August 13, 1912, Congress enacted a \"Wireless Law\" to regulate radio\ncommunication. The whole law may be found in the appendix of this book,\nbut briefly as far as the amateur is concerned it is as follows:\n\nAn amateur may not use transmitting apparatus which is sufficiently\npowerful to send radio signals across any of the boundaries of the state\nin which he is located and which can be detected by a sensitive\nreceiving set located just beyond the state boundary, nor can he use\napparatus which is powerful enough to interfere with the reception of\nsignals by others from beyond the state boundaries unless he has a\n_license_.\n\nAn amateur may receive messages from anywhere at any time without a\nlicense provided that his station is not also fitted with transmitting\napparatus.\n\nIn other words if the amateur possesses a receiving outfit only which is\nin working order or if he has both transmitter and receptor and the\nformer is not powerful enough to send signals out of the state in which\nhe lives, or to interfere with the reception of messages by another when\nthe messages come from beyond the state boundary a _license_ is\nunnecessary.\n\nThis is of course somewhat unfair for those living near the center of\nlarge states for they may operate almost as they please with ordinary\ninstruments with no fear of the signals going beyond the border, while\nthose living within a few miles of another state must secure a license.\n\nIf an amateur has a license he may transmit messages beyond the state\nborder, but he must not employ a wave length greater than 200 meters or\na power input into the transmitter of more than 1 K.W. without special\npermission.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 148. Experimental Amateur Station of W. Haddon,\nBrooklyn, N. Y.]\n\nIf the amateur is within five nautical miles of an army or navy station\nequipped with radio apparatus his power input must not be more than 1\nK.W.\n\n*Complying with Law.*\u2014After a license is secured, or rather as a matter\nof fact in order to secure it, the wave length must not be greater than\n200 meters. In order to secure such a wave length the effective portion\nof the aerial cannot usually be made greater than 115 feet in\nconsideration of the amount which the lead-in, helix and ground wire\nadd.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 149. Complete Receiving Outfit Consisting of\nReceiving Transformer, Detector, Fixed Condenser, Loading Coil, Two\nVariable Condensers, Potentiometer, Battery, Switches, etc.]\n\nSuch an aerial will serve well for transmitting purposes, but is too\nshort for receiving very long distances. If the amateur desires to pick\nup long distance messages he must employ two aerials, a short one for\ntransmitting and a long one for receiving. If it is desirable to use the\nlong aerial for both transmitting and receiving its wave length may be\nbrought down to 200 meters or under, while transmitting by placing a\nlarge glass plate condenser of the proper capacity in series with the\naerial. It may be short-circuited with a suitable switch when receiving.\n\nThe law also says that the transmitting wave must be pure, and must be\nsharply tuned, which means that the wave must be of one length and not,\nas is very often the case, composed of two or more waves of different\nlengths.\n\nIn order to comply with this restriction, the use of an oscillation\nhelix or loosely coupled helix is necessary. A rotary or quenched gap is\nalso necessary in place of the ordinary spark gap.\n\nThe construction of all three of these instruments is described farther\non.\n\n*How to Obtain a License.*\u2014In order to obtain a license send to the\nnearest Radio Inspector; Radio Inspectors are stationed at the Custom\nHouses at the following cities: Boston, Mass.; New York, N. Y.;\nSavannah, Ga.; Baltimore, Md.; Cleveland, Ohio; Chicago, Ill.; Seattle,\nWash.; New Orleans, La.; San Francisco, Cal.; and obtain a copy of The\nWireless Law, 8-6412, The Regulations Governing Radio Communication, The\nBerlin International Radio-telegraphic Convention, and the necessary\nApplication Forms.\n\nLook over the Wireless Law, the Regulations and the Berlin Convention\npamphlet, then fill out Form 756. This is an application for an\noperator\u2019s license.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 150. Receiving Outfit Consisting of Receiving\nTransformer, Fixed Condenser and Detector.]\n\nIf the amateur is not already in possession of a certificate of skill as\nan operator it will be necessary to find out, from the commandant at the\nnearest one of the stations, listed on page 4 of the Regulations as\nbeing the places where examinations are given, on what days the\nexaminations are held. If the amateur is able to pass the examination,\nan _operator\u2019s license_ will be issued. Then fill out Form 757 and\nforward it to the Radio Inspector. If he thinks your station conforms to\nthe regulations without inspection the license will be issued; if not,\nthe license will be issued after inspection.\n\nThere are no fees to pay in connection with securing any of the\nlicenses.\n\n\n\nAPPARATUS REQUIRED IN MANY INSTANCES IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE\nWIRELESS LAW.\n\n\n*OSCILLATION HELIX*\n\nThe oscillation helix has almost become a necessity in order to comply\nwith the regulations of the Wireless Law regarding wave form, except in\nthose stations where a quenched gap is used.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 151. Amco Oscillation Helix.]\n\nThe wave emitted by many stations is not pure. It is composed usually of\ntwo or three separate waves of different lengths instead of all the\nenergy being confined to oscillations of one period. It is possible to\ntune such a wave in two or more places or \"humps,\" as they are called,\non the tuning coil. It is obvious that a wave possessing such humps\ncannot be closely tuned and is liable to interfere with the signals of\nanother station. This is one of the principal causes of interference.\n\nThe reason for this phenomenon is simple. The action of a transmitter is\nto first charge a condenser. When the potential of the condenser rises\nto sufficient value it discharges across the spark gap and sets up\noscillations in the _closed_ circuit. These oscillations immediately\ninduce oscillations in the _open_ circuit or aerial system and part of\nthe energy passes off into the ether as electro-magnetic waves. However,\nthe oscillations in the _aerial_ system do not immediately die away\nafter the oscillations in the closed circuit cease during the interim\nuntil the next condenser discharge, but continue to surge and react upon\nthe dosed circuit to sufficient extent to induce therein currents which\nsurge back and forth long after the current from the condenser discharge\nhas died away.\n\nWe might call the oscillations due to the condenser discharge _primary\noscillations_ and those induced in the aerial thereby _secondary\noscillations_. Those which are then set up in the closed circuit by the\nreaction of the _secondary_ currents are _tertiary_. This third train of\noscillations persist after the secondary currents have died away, and\ninduce another set of oscillations in the aerial which send out a second\nset of electromagnetic waves differing in length from the first.\n\nThe oscillations which take place after the initial surge in the closed\nand open circuits are naturally somewhat weak. By using an oscillation\nhelix in which the primary and secondary are separated from each other\nit is possible to eliminate the third and fourth trains of oscillations\nand all others having a tendency to follow, by placing the circuits\napart so that the weak oscillations are not strong enough* to react\nacross the intervening space. The immediate oscillations set up by the\ncondenser discharge are strong enough to act across the space and set up\npowerful oscillations in the aerial.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 152. Details of Oscillation Helix Construction.]\n\nA hot wire ammeter placed in the aerial circuit of a transmitter\nemploying an oscillation transformer will not indicate as much current\nas if placed in the same position in a circuit using an ordinary helix;\nbut in spite of the fact, a transmitter using an oscillation helix will\nsend farther because the energy is concentrated in waves of one length.\n\nThe construction of one type of oscillation helix has already been\noutlined on page 92. The form shown in Fig. 152 has no special\nadvantages over the other but is preferred by many experimenters.\n\nIt is of the \"pancake\" type, so-called because of the flat form of the\nwindings which are made in the shape of a spiral of brass ribbon set in\na slotted frame.\n\nThe dimensions of the helix are clearly apparent from the drawing. The\nprimary is composed of seven turns of brass ribbon 1/2 inch wide and\n1/16 inch thick. The secondary should have from 10 to 15 turns of ribbon\n3/8 x 1/16. The coils may be slid back and forth on the brass rod so\nthat the distance between them is variable. Connection is made to the\ncoils by means of suitable clips. A clip similar to that shown on page\n92, but made to snap on a flat ribbon instead of a round wire, will\nserve the purpose.\n\n*QUENCHED SPARK GAP.*\n\nA \"quenched\" gap is made up of a number of brass or copper disks\naccurately turned to a true surface and separated by mica or rubber\nrings about .01 inch thick. The spark discharge takes place in the\nair-tight space at the center of the disks, inside of the mica rings.\n\nThe quenched gap has several advantages over other forms. It is\npractically noiseless and the nuisance of a crashing discharge may be\navoided by its use.\n\nThe large surface offered to the spark by the disks cools the spark and\nquickly stops the oscillations in the closed circuit, and thereby leaves\nthe open circuit and aerial system free to vibrate in its own period and\ntherefore radiates _pure_ waves. By pure wave a wave of one length is\nmeant.\n\nA quenched gap cannot be used on a set of over 1 K.W. power without\nartificial cooling by an air blast.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 153. Quenched Gap.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 154. Quenched Gap.]\n\nFig. 154 shows an efficient form of quenched gap for use in stations up\nto 1 K.W. in power.\n\nThe disks are shown in detail in Fig. 155. They are cast out of copper\nand then turned perfectly true and smooth in a lathe. After surfacing,\nthe discharge surface should be heavily silver plated and buffed smooth.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. Details of Disk and Ring.]\n\nThe disks are piled on a marble base with a mica ring between each. They\nare clamped down by a strong set screw mounted on a heavy brass yoke.\nEnough pressure should be brought to bear to force the plates tightly\ntogether and make them air tight.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 156. Explanatory Drawing of Quenched Gap.]\n\nThe number of disks required is governed by the voltage of the charging\ncondenser. Generally speaking it is one section of .01-inch gap for each\nthousand volts delivered by the secondary of the transformer. It is very\nimportant to secure just the proper number of disks. If properly\nadjusted, the quenched gap will give one discharge for each alternation\nof the current and produce a musical tone.\n\nThe quenched gap is placed in the same position in the transmitting\ncircuit as any other form of gap.\n\n*ROTARY GAPS.*\n\nRotary gaps are divided into two general classes, the synchronous gap\nand the non-synchronous gap.\n\nThe former usually consists of one or more stationary electrodes and a\nrotating member made like a star wheel with projecting spokes. This\nrotary member is attached directly to the shaft of the alternator or\nmotor generator and arranged so that a spoke always comes opposite a\nstationary member at the exact moment that the maximum of potential is\nobtained in the condenser. Such an arrangement permits one discharge for\neach alternation of the current and produces a pure musical note easily\ndistinguished in the telephone receivers at a distant station.\n\nIn the non-synchronous rotary gap the wheel is driven at a high rate of\nspeed without any regard to synchronism with the alternations of the\ncurrent.\n\nThe rotary gap shown in Fig. 157 is of the non-synchronous type.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 157. Amco Rotary Gap.]\n\nThe rotating member is cast from an alloy of equal parts of zinc and\naluminum. It is necessary to first make a wooden pattern from which the\ncasting may be made. The details of the wheel are shown in Fig. 158. The\ncasting must be placed in a lathe chuck and turned true. It is mounted\non a hard rubber disk 2 7/8 inches in diameter and 1/4 of an inch thick.\nThe disk serves to insulate the revolving electrodes from the motor\nshaft. The \"rotor\" is mounted upon the shaft by means of a small brass\nbushing which passes through the center of the disk.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 158. Details of Revolving Parts of Rotary Gap.]\n\nThe motor must be well built and capable of running at high speed. A\n\"Juno\" motor will be found very satisfactory. When running free its\nspeed is about 4500 r.p.m. With the rotor in place the speed is about\n3600 r.p.m.\n\nThe motor should be mounted on a heavy marble base capable of absorbing\nany little vibration that the gap may be subject to when running at high\nspeed.\n\nThe stationary electrodes are made in the same manner as those for an\nordinary gap and consists of two flanged zinc electrodes mounted upon\nthreaded brass rods supported by two hexagonal standards. The axis of\nthe electrodes should be the same height above the base as that of the\nmotor shaft.\n\nThe rotor should be carefully balanced so that it is practically free\nfrom vibration by boring small holes in the back face so as to make the\nweight on opposite sides equal.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. Details of Rotary Gap.]\n\nThe motor may be driven by a battery or from the same source that\nsupplies the transformer, in series with two or three suitable lamps. A\nmotor wound to run directly from the 110-volt line or a higher potential\nmust have its fields wound with very fine wire and is apt to give\ntrouble through \"burn-outs,\" due to \"kick back.\" When the motor is\noperated on batteries or is wound for running in series with a lamp the\ndanger is lessened.\n\nA rotary gap is placed in the transmitting circuit in the same position\nas any other gap. Its use will result in a wonderful increase in the\ntransmitting range of almost any station, for not only will the amount\nof energy passing through the aerial be raised, but the clear musical\ntone given off is more plainly distinguishable at a greater distance in\nthe receiving station than a spark of the ordinary sort.\n\n*\"KICK BACK.\"*\n\nThe oscillations taking place in the closed circuit and aerial system of\na wireless transmitter continue to surge after the current in the\ncondenser has dropped below a certain value, and react upon the primary\nwinding of the coil or transformer by induction and produce high\nvoltage, high frequency currents termed \"kick back,\" in wireless\ntelegraph parlance.\n\n\"Kick back,\" wherever it exists to an appreciable extent, is liable to\ndamage insulation and cause possible \"burn-outs.\" The \"kick-back\"\npreventers illustrated in the accompanying diagrams will be found an\nefficient method of avoiding this danger.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 160. Methods of Preventing \"Kick Back.\"]\n\nThe first method shows an ordinary pressed telephone condenser of about\ntwo microfarads capacity connected directly across the A. C. mains near\nthe transformer terminals, in series with two 6-ampere fuses. The\ncondenser is shunted by a small spark gap made of needle points with a\nvery small space, about .005 of an inch, between them.\n\nThe second method is an elaboration of the first and shows two sets of\ncondensers in series with fuses and bridged by spark gaps with a\n\"ground\" through a third condenser connected between. This second method\nis the best and is often used to prevent delicate instruments, such as a\nvoltmeter, from the effects of \"kick back.\"\n\nA proper \"kick-back\" preventer is part of the Fire Insurance\nUnderwriters requirements for a wireless telegraph station.\n\n\n\nReceiving Apparatus.\n\n\n*THE VARIOMETER.*\n\nA variometer is a tuning device in which two coils of wire are placed in\nseries and connected so that the turns can be made to oppose one\nanother. One coil is movable and by turning it the currents flowing\nthrough the adjacent coils oppose each other and decrease the\nself-induction of the whole and consequently the period of the circuit.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 161. Variometer.]\n\nThe accompanying illustration shows the constructive details of an\nefficient form of variometer.\n\nThe coils are wound around two cardboard cylinders. One cylinder is 6\ninches in diameter and the other 5 inches. Both are 2 inches long. The\nlarge cylinder is wound with twenty-five turns of No. 22 B. S. gauge\nsingle silk covered wire wound in two sections so as to leave a space\n3/8 inch wide in the center. The small cylinder is wound in the same\nmanner with the same size of wire but contains thirty turns so as to\nmake the length of wire in each of the coils practically equal.\n\nThe space in the center of each of the coils allows a supporting rod to\npass through without interfering with the wire. The shaft is a piece of\n5/16 _brass_ rod about 7 1/2 inches long. The upper end is provided with\na knob and a pointer. The large coil is mounted on the under side of a\nwooden cover made to fit a containing case of the proper size to receive\nthe variometer and of a style similar to that ordinarily used to enclose\na variable condenser.\n\nThe shaft passes through the larger coil, at two points diametrically\nopposite, but should not fit tightly. It also passes through the smaller\ncoil but is fastened to the latter by means of a cross bar so that when\nthe knob is turned the coil will revolve also. The coils are connected\nby means of a piece of braided wire or flexible conductor, long enough\nso as not to interfere with the movement of the inner coil.\n\nThe outside terminals of the coils terminate in binding posts mounted on\nthe top of the case. When making a variometer be careful not to employ\nany iron or steel in its construction, not even iron screws.\n\nThe variometer is placed in the receiving circuit by connecting it in\nseries with the aerial before it reaches the tuning coil or loose\ncoupler.\n\n*NEW CRYSTAL DETECTORS.*\n\n*Silicon Detector.*\u2014The silicon detector is always interesting because\nit was one of the first mineral rectifiers to come into extended use.\nThe photograph shown below illustrates one of the latest forms of the\nsilicon detector.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 162. Silicon Detector.]\n\nThe large cup supported by the left-hand standard contacts several\npieces of fused silicon embedded in fusible alloy. The right-hand\nstandard supports a movable \"offset\" cup the same as that used on the\nPerikon type of Detector. A small piece of _arsenic_ is mounted in this\ncup and may be brought to bear against any portion of any of the silicon\ncrystals.\n\n*Pyron Detector.*\u2014The Pyron detector is not new, but the photograph\nshows a very simple and efficient form in which a fine wire is brought\nto bear against a crystal of iron pyrites mounted in a small cup.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 163. Pyron Detector.]\n\n*Galena Detector.*\u2014Although _galena_ is named in the list of sensitive\nminerals on page 132 it has come into such extensive use as a detector\nsince the first edition of this book to be worthy of special attention.\nGalena detectors are often spoken of as \"cat-whisker\" detectors because\nof the long fine wire used to secure a delicate contact with the\nmineral.\n\nThe mineral is usually placed in a cup and held in position by imbedding\nin fusible alloy or clamped with a set screw. The best surface of the\nmineral should be selected by testing previous to imbedding it in the\ncup. Contact is made with the surface of the mineral by means of a piece\nof No. 30 phosphor bronze wire mounted on the end of a short brass rod\nfitted with an adjusting screw so that by turning or twisting the\nsurface of the mineral may be \"searched\" and the tension varied.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 164. Galena Detector.]\n\nSuch an arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 164. The base is a hard\nrubber block 3 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 1/2. The binding posts are of the type\ncommonly used on electrical instruments. One of the posts is pivoted by\nplacing a spring washer under the head of the screw which holds the post\nto the base. A short piece of brass rod fitted with a hard rubber knob\npasses through the wire hole in the post. A piece of No. 30 phosphor\nbronze wire is soldered to the end of the rod. By twisting the post and\nsliding the rod any portion of the mineral surface may be selected.\nTwisting the rod varies the tension of the contact.\n\nThe galena detector is connected in the receiving circuit in the same\nmanner as other detectors of the mineral type.\n\n*THE AUDION.*\n\n*The Audion*\u2014is finding favor in many amateur wireless stations, because\nof its almost entire lack of adjustment and of the loud clear signals\nwhich it gives even when used for long distance work.\n\nThe illustration shows the latest form of audion, the plate and the grid\nboth being on the same side of the filament.\n\nThe filament of an audion is usually lighted by means of a six-volt\nstorage battery. A small battery rheostat placed in series with the\nbattery serves to regulate the amount of current flowing through the\nfilament. Only one filament is used at a time, the other being saved as\na reserve in case the first burns out.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 165. Audion.]\n\nThe higher voltage necessary to operate an audion is supplied by a\nbattery consisting of fifteen flashlight batteries, each flashlight\nbattery being composed of three separate cells. The batteries are\nconnected to an eight-point switch so that throwing the switch on the\nfirst point will connect five sets of batteries. The second point places\nfive more in circuit and each additional point one set only. It is also\na good plan to connect a four-point switch and three separate cells of\nbattery in series with the eight-point switch so that they may be added\nto the circuit one at a time and the potential varied more closely than\nthe steps on the eight-point switch permit. The maximum voltage of such\na battery is approximately 56 volts.\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 166 shows exactly how an audion is connected. The\nwires _A_ and _B_ are the terminals leading to the tuning coil or loose\ncoupler. It is not necessary that the telephone receivers used with an\naudion be wound to a high resistance in order to secure good results.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 166. Audion Circuit.]\n\nThe audion is placed in operation by turning the rheostat until the\nfilament lights brightly. Then adjust the voltage of the high potential\nbattery until the signals are clearest. If the voltage is too high the\naudion will become filled with a bluish light and the voltage should be\nimmediately reduced. The signals will be loudest when the filament is\nbrilliantly lighted. No more current should be passed through the\nfilament than is necessary to render the signals plain, for if \"forced\"\nits life will be limited to only a few hours.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 167. Rotary Variable Condenser.]\n\n\n\n\n                              *APPENDIX.*\n\n                           [PUBLIC No. 264.]\n\n                               [S. 6412.]\n\n                An Act to Regulate Radio Communication.\n\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\nStates of America in Congress assembled._ That a person, company, or\ncorporation within the jurisdiction of the United States shall not use\nor operate any apparatus for radio communication as a means of\ncommercial intercourse among the several States, or with foreign\nnations, or upon any vessel of the United States engaged in interstate\nor foreign commerce, or for the transmission of radiograms or signals\nthe effect of which extends beyond the jurisdiction of the State or\nTerritory in which the same are made, or where interference would be\ncaused thereby with the receipt of messages or signals from beyond the\njurisdiction of the said State or Territory, except under and in\naccordance with a license, revocable for cause, in that behalf granted\nby the Secretary of Commerce and Labor upon application therefor; but\nnothing in this Act shall be construed to apply to the transmission and\nexchange of radiograms or signals between points situated in the same\nState: _Provided_, That the effect thereof shall not extend beyond the\njurisdiction of the said State or interfere with the reception of\nradiograms or signals from beyond said jurisdiction; and a license shall\nnot be required for the transmission or exchange of radiograms or\nsignals by or on behalf of the Government of the United States, but\nevery Government station on land or sea shall have special call letters\ndesignated and published in the list of radio stations of the United\nStates by the Department of Commerce and Labor.

That for the purpose of preventing or minimizing interference\nwith communication between stations in which such apparatus is operated,\nto facilitate radio communication, and to further the prompt receipt of\ndistress signals, said private and commercial stations shall be subject\nto the regulations of this section. These regulations shall be enforced\nby the Secretary of Commerce and Labor through the collectors of customs\nand other officers of the Government as other regulations herein\nprovided for.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce and Labor may, in his discretion, waive the\nprovisions of any or all of these regulations when no interference of\nthe character above mentioned can ensue.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce and Labor may grant special temporary licenses\nto stations actually engaged in conducting experiments for the\ndevelopment of the science of radio communication, or the apparatus\npertaining thereto, to carry on special tests, using any amount of power\nor any wave lengths, at such hours and under such conditions as will\ninsure the least interference with the sending or receipt of commercial\nor Government radiograms, of distress signals and radiograms, or with\nthe work of other stations.\n\nIn these regulations the naval and military stations shall be understood\nto be stations on land.\n\n                              REGULATIONS.\n\n                          NORMAL WAVE LENGTH.\n\nFirst. Every station shall be required to designate certain definite\nwave length as the normal sending and receiving wave length of the\nstation. This wave length shall not exceed six hundred meters or it\nshall exceed one thousand six hundred meters. Every coastal station open\nto general public service shall at all times be ready to receive\nmessages of such wave lengths as are required by the Berlin convention.\nEvery ship station, except as hereinafter provided, and every coast\nstation open to general public service shall be prepared to use two\nsending wave lengths, one of three hundred meters and one of six hundred\nmeters, as required by the international convention in force:\n_Provided_, That the Secretary of Commerce and Labor may, in his\ndiscretion, change the limit of wave length reservation made by\nregulations first and second to accord with any international agreement\nto which the United States is a party.\n\n                          OTHER WAVE LENGTHS.\n\nSecond. In addition to the normal sending wave length all stations,\nexcept as provided hereinafter in these regulations, may use other\nsending wave lengths: _Provided_, That they do not exceed six hundred\nmeters or that they do exceed one thousand six hundred meters: _Provided\nfurther_, That the character of the waves emitted conforms to the\nrequirements of regulations third and fourth following.\n\n                          USE OF A \"PURE WAVE\"\n\nThird. At all stations if the sending apparatus, to be referred to\nhereinafter as the \"transmitter,\" is of such a character that the energy\nis radiated in two or more wave lengths, more or less sharply defined,\nas indicated by a sensitive wave meter, the energy in no one of the\nlesser waves shall exceed ten per centum of that in the greatest.\n\n                         USE OF A \"SHARP WAVE.\"\n\nFourth. At all stations the logarithmic decrement per complete\noscillation in the wave trains emitted by the transmitter shall not\nexceed two-tenths, except when sending distress signals or signals and\nmessages relating thereto.\n\n                    USE OF \"STANDARD DISTRESS WAVE.\"\n\nFifth. Every station on shipboard shall be prepared to send distress\ncalls on the normal wave length designated by the international\nconvention in force, except on vessels of small tonnage unable to have\nplants insuring that wave length.\n\n                          SIGNAL OF DISTRESS.\n\nSixth. The distress call used shall be the international signal of\ndistress: dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.\n\n         USE OF \"BROAD INTERFERING WAVE\" FOR DISTRESS SIGNALS.\n\nSeventh. When sending distress signals, the transmitter of a station on\nshipboard may be tuned in such a manner as to create a maximum of\ninterference with a maximum of radiation.\n\n               DISTANCE REQUIREMENT FOR DISTRESS SIGNALS.\n\nEighth. Every station on shipboard, wherever practicable, shall be\nprepared to send distress signals of the character specified in\nregulations fifth and sixth with sufficient power to enable them to be\nreceived by day over sea a distance of one hundred nautical miles by a\nshipboard station equipped with apparatus for both sending and receiving\nequal in all essential particulars to that of the station first\nmentioned.\n\n                         FOR DISTRESS SIGNALS.\n\nNinth. All stations are required to give absolute priority to signals\nand radiograms relating to ships in distress; to cease all sending on\nhearing a distress signal; and, except when engaged in answering or\naiding the ship in distress, to refrain from sending until all signals\nand radiograms relating thereto are completed.\n\n           REDUCED POWER FOR SHIPS NEAR A GOVERNMENT STATION.\n\nTenth. No station on shipboard, when within fifteen nautical miles of a\nnaval or military station, shall use a transformer input exceeding one\nkilowatt, nor, when within five nautical miles of such a station, a\ntransformer input exceeding one-half kilowatt, except for sending\nsignals of distress, or signals or radiograms relating thereto.\n\n                          INTERCOMMUNICATION.\n\nEleventh. Each shore station open to general public service between the\ncost and vessels at sea shall be bound to exchange radiograms with any\nsimilar shore station and with any ship station without distinction of\nthe radio systems adopted by such stations, respectively, and each\nstation on shipboard shall be bound to exchange radiograms with any\nother station on shipboard without distinction of the radio systems\nadopted by each station respectively.\n\nIt shall be the duty of each such shore station, during the hours it is\nin operation, to listen in at intervals of not less than fifteen minutes\nand for a period not less than two minutes, with the receiver tuned to\nreceive messages of three hundred meter wave lengths.\n\n                           DIVISION OF TIME.\n\nTwelfth. At important seaports and at all other places where naval or\nmilitary and private or commercial shore stations operate in such close\nproximity that interference with the work of naval and military stations\ncan not be avoided by the enforcement of the regulations contained in\nthe foregoing regulations concerning wave lengths and character of\nsignals emitted, such private or commercial shore stations as do\ninterfere with the reception of signals by the naval and military\nstations concerned shall not use their transmitters during the first\nfifteen minutes of each hour, local standard time. The Secretary of\nCommerce and Labor may, on the recommendation of the department\nconcerned, designate the station or stations which may be required to\nobserve this division of time.\n\n            GOVERNMENT STATIONS TO OBSERVE DIVISION OF TIME.\n\nThirteenth. The naval or military stations for which the above mentioned\ndivision of time may be established shall transmit signals or radiograms\nonly during the first fifteen minutes of each hour, local standard time,\nexcept in case of signals or radiograms relating to vessels in distress,\nas hereinbefore provided.\n\n                       USE OF UNNECESSARY POWER.\n\nFourteenth. In all circumstances, except in case of signals or\nradiograms relating to vessels in distress, all stations shall use the\nminimum amount of energy necessary to carry out any communication\ndesired.\n\n               GENERAL RESTRICTIONS ON PRIVATE STATIONS.\n\nFifteenth. No private or commercial station not engaged in the\ntransaction of bona fide commercial business by radio communication or\nin experimentation in connection with the development and manufacture of\nradio apparatus for commercial purposes shall use a transmitting wave\nlength exceeding two hundred meters, or a transformer input exceeding\none kilowatt, except by special authority of the Secretary of Commerce\nand Labor contained in the license of the station: _Provided_, That the\nowner or operator of a station of the character mentioned in this\nregulation shall not be liable for a violation of the requirements of\nthe third or fourth regulations to the penalties of one hundred dollars\nor twenty-five dollars, respectively, provided in this section unless\nthe person maintaining or operating such station shall have been\nnotified in writing that the said transmitter has been found, upon tests\nconducted by the Government, to be so adjusted as to violate the said\nthird and fourth regulations, and opportunity has been given to said\nowner or operator to adjust said transmitter in conformity with said\nregulations.\n\n     SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS IN THE VICINITIES OF GOVERNMENT STATIONS.\n\nSixteenth. No station of the character mentioned in regulation fifteenth\nsituated within five nautical miles of a naval or military station shall\nuse a transmitting wave length exceeding two hundred meters or a\ntransformer input exceeding one-half kilowatt.\n\n       SHIP STATIONS TO COMMUNICATE WITH NEAREST SHORE STATIONS.\n\nSeventeenth. In general, the shipboard stations shall transmit their\nradiograms to the nearest shore station. A sender on board a vessel\nshall, however, have the right to designate the shore station through\nwhich he desires to have his radiograms transmitted. If this can not be\ndone, the wishes of the sender are to be complied with only if the\ntransmission can be effected without interfering with the service of\nother stations.\n\n    LIMITATIONS FOR FUTURE INSTALLATIONS IN VICINITIES OF GOVERNMENT\n                               STATIONS.\n\nEighteenth. No station on shore not in actual operation at the date of\nthe passage of this Act shall be licensed for the transaction of\ncommercial business by radio communication within fifteen nautical miles\nof the following naval or military stations, to wit: Arlington,\nVirginia; Key West, Florida; San Juan, Porto Rico; North Head and\nTatoosh Island, Washington; San Diego, California; and those established\nor which may be established in Alaska and in the Canal Zone; and the\nhead of the department having control of such Government stations shall,\nso far as is consistent with the transaction of governmental business,\narrange for the transmission and receipt of commercial radiograms under\nthe provisions of the Berlin convention of nineteen hundred and six and\nfuture international conventions or treaties to which the United States\nmay be a party, at each of the stations above referred to, and shall fix\nthe rates therefor, subject to control of such rates by Congress. At\nsuch stations and wherever and whenever shore stations open for general\npublic business between the coast and vessels at sea under the\nprovisions of the Berlin convention of nineteen hundred and six and\nfuture international conventions and treaties to which the United States\nmay be a party shall not be so established as to insure a constant\nservice day and night without interruption, and in all localities\nwherever or whenever such service shall not be maintained by a\ncommercial shore station within one hundred nautical miles of a naval\nradio station, the Secretary of the Navy shall, so far as is consistent\nwith the transaction of governmental business, open naval radio stations\nto the general public business described above, and shall fix rates for\nsuch service, subject to control of such rates by Congress. The receipts\nfrom such radiograms shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous\nreceipts.\n\n                          SECRECY OF MESSAGES.\n\nNineteenth. No person or persons engaged in or having knowledge of the\noperation of any station or stations shall divulge or publish the\ncontents of any messages transmitted or received by such station, except\nto the person or persons to whom the same may be directed, or their\nauthorized agent, or to another station employed to forward such message\nto its destination, unless legally required so to do by the court of\ncompetent jurisdiction or other competent authority. Any person guilty\nof divulging or publishing any message, except as herein provided,\nshall, on conviction thereof, be punishable by a fine of not more than\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars or imprisonment for a period of not\nexceeding three months, or both fine and imprisonment, in the discretion\nof the court.\n\n                               PENALTIES.\n\nFor violation of any of these regulations, subject to which a license\nunder sections one and two of this Act may be issued, the owner of the\napparatus shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars, which may\nbe reduced or remitted by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, and for\nrepeated violations of any of such regulations, the license may be\nrevoked.\n\nFor violation of any of these regulations, except as provided in\nregulation nineteenth, subject to which a license under section three of\nthis Act may be issued, the operator shall be subject to a penalty of\ntwenty-five dollars, which may be reduced or remitted by the Secretary\nof Commerce and Labor, and for repeated violations of any such\nregulations, the license shall be suspended or revoked.\n\nSEC. 5. That every license granted under the provisions of this Act for\nthe operation or use of apparatus for radio communication shall\nprescribe that the operator thereof shall not wilfully or maliciously\ninterfere with any other radio communication.

D.\nPROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS IN QUEEN\u2019S COLLEGE, CORK.\nii\nTO\nJOHN RYALL, LL.D.\nVICE-PRESIDENT AND PROFESSOR OF GREEK\nIN QUEEN\u2019S COLLEGE, CORK,\nTHIS WORK IS INSCRIBED\nIN TESTIMONY OF FRIENDSHIP AND ESTEEM\nPREFACE.\n\u2014\u22c4\u2014\nThe following work is not a republication of a former treatise by the Author,\nentitled, \u201cThe Mathematical Analysis of Logic.\u201d Its earlier portion is indeed\ndevoted to the same object, and it begins by establishing the same system\nof fundamental laws, but its methods are more general, and its range of\napplications far wider. It exhibits the results, matured by some years of\nstudy and reflection, of a principle of investigation relating to the intellectual\noperations, the previous exposition of which was written within a few weeks\nafter its idea had been conceived.\nThat portion of this work which relates to Logic presupposes in its reader a\nknowledge of the most important terms of the science, as usually treated, and\nof its general object. On these points there is no better guide than Archbishop\nWhately\u2019s \u201cElements of Logic,\u201d or Mr. Thomson\u2019s \u201cOutlines of the Laws of\nThought.\u201d To the former of these treatises, the present revival of attention to\nthis class of studies seems in a great measure due. Some acquaintance with the\nprinciples of Algebra is also requisite, but it is not necessary that this application\nshould have been carried beyond the solution of simple equations. For the study\nof those chapters which relate to the theory of probabilities, a somewhat larger\nknowledge of Algebra is required, and especially of the doctrine of Elimination,\nand of the solution of Equations containing more than one unknown quantity.\nPreliminary information upon the subject-matter will be found in the special\ntreatises on Probabilities in \u201cLardner\u2019s Cabinet Cyclop\u00e6dia,\u201d and the \u201cLibrary\nof Useful Knowledge,\u201d the former of these by Professor De Morgan, the latter\nby Sir John Lubbock; and in an interesting series of Letters translated from\nthe French of M. Quetelet. Other references will be given in the work. On\na first perusal the reader may omit at his discretion, Chapters x., xiv., and\nxix., together with any of the applications which he may deem uninviting or\nirrelevant.\nIn different parts of the work, and especially in the notes to the concluding\nchapter, will be found references to various writers, ancient and modern, chiefly\ndesigned to illustrate a certain view of the history of philosophy. With respect\nto these, the Author thinks it proper to add, that he has in no instance given\niii\nPREFACE. iv\na citation which he has not believed upon careful examination to be supported\neither by parallel authorities, or by the general tenor of the work from which\nit was taken. While he would gladly have avoided the introduction of anything\nwhich might by possibility be construed into the parade of learning, he felt it\nto be due both to his subject and to the truth, that the statements in the text\nshould be accompanied by the means of verification. And if now, in bringing\nto its close a labour, of the extent of which few persons will be able to judge\nfrom its apparent fruits, he may be permitted to speak for a single moment\nof the feelings with which he has pursued, and with which he now lays aside,\nhis task, he would say, that he never doubted that it was worthy of his best\nefforts; that he felt that whatever of truth it might bring to light was not a\nprivate or arbitrary thing, not dependent, as to its essence, upon any human\nopinion. He was fully aware that learned and able men maintained opinions\nupon the subject of Logic directly opposed to the views upon which the entire\nargument and procedure of his work rested. While he believed those opinions to\nbe erroneous, he was conscious that his own views might insensibly be warped\nby an influence of another kind. He felt in an especial manner the danger of that\nintellectual bias which long attention to a particular aspect of truth tends to\nproduce. But he trusts that out of this conflict of opinions the same truth will\nbut emerge the more free from any personal admixture; that its different parts\nwill be seen in their just proportion; and that none of them will eventually be\ntoo highly valued or too lightly regarded because of the prejudices which may\nattach to the mere form of its exposition.\nTo his valued friend, the Rev. George Stephens Dickson, of Lincoln, the\nAuthor desires to record his obligations for much kind assistance in the revision\nof this work, and for some important suggestions.\n5, Grenville-place, Cork,\nNov. 30th. 1853.\nCONTENTS.\n\u2014\u22c4\u2014\nCHAPTER I.\nNature and Design of this Work,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\nCHAPTER II.\nSigns and their Laws, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\nCHAPTER III.\nDerivation of the Laws, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28\nCHAPTER IV.\nDivision of Propositions,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .37\nCHAPTER V.\nPrinciples of Symbolic Reasoning, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48\nCHAPTER VI.\nOf Interpretation, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59\nCHAPTER VII.\nOf Elimination, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74\nCHAPTER VIII.\nOf Reduction, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 87\nv\nCONTENTS. vi\nCHAPTER IX.\nMethods of Abbreviation, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100\nCHAPTER X.\nConditions of a Perfect Method, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 117\nCHAPTER XI.\nOf Secondary Propositions, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 124\nCHAPTER XII.\nMethods in Secondary Propositions, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 137\nCHAPTER XIII.\nClarke and Spinoza, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 143\nCHAPTER XIV.\nExample of Analysis, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 169\nCHAPTER XV.\nOf the Aristotelian Logic,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .174\nCHAPTER XVI.\nOf the Theory of Probabilities, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 187\nCHAPTER XVII.\nGeneral Method in Probabilities, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 194\nCHAPTER XVIII.\nElementary Illustrations, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 211\nCHAPTER XIX.\nOf Statistical Conditions, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 227\nCHAPTER XX.\nProblems on Causes, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 247\nCHAPTER XXI.\nProbability of Judgments, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 293\nCHAPTER XXII.\nConstitution of the Intellect, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 311\nNOTE.\nIn Prop. II., p. 261, by the \u201cabsolute probabilities\u201d of the events x, y, z.. is\nmeant simply what the probabilities of those events ought to be, in order that,\nregarding them as independent, and their probabilities as our only data, the\ncalculated probabilities of the same events under the condition V should be\np, g, r.. The statement of the appended problem of the urn must be modified\nin a similar way. The true solution of that problem, as actually stated, is\np\u2032 = cp, q\u2032 = cq, in which c is the arbitrary probability of the condition that\nthe ball drawn shall be either white, or of marble, or both at once.\u2013See p. 270,\nCASE II.*\nAccordingly, since by the logical reduction the solution of all questions in\nthe theory of probabilities is brought to a form in which, from the probabilities\nof simple events, s, t, &c. under a given condition, V , it is required to\ndetermine the probability of some combination, A, of those events under the\nsame condition, the principle of the demonstration in Prop. IV. is really the\nfollowing:\u2013\u201cThe probability of such combination A under the condition V must\nbe calculated as if the events s, t, &c. were independent, and possessed of\nsuch probabilities as would cause the derived probabilities of the said events\nunder the same condition V to be such as are assigned to them in the data.\u201d\nThis principle I regard as axiomatic. At the same time it admits of indefinite\nverification, as well directly as through the results of the method of which it\nforms the basis. I think it right to add, that it was in the above form that the\nprinciple first presented itself to my mind, and that it is thus that I have always\nunderstood it, the error in the particular problem referred to having arisen from\ninadvertence in the choice of a material illustration.\nvii\nChapter I\nNATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK.\n1. The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of\nthose operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression\nto them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to\nestablish the science of Logic and construct its method; to make that method\nitself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical\ndoctrine of Probabilities; and, finally, to collect from the various elements of\ntruth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations\nconcerning the nature and constitution of the human mind.\n2. That this design is not altogether a novel one it is almost needless to\nremark, and it is well known that to its two main practical divisions of Logic\nand Probabilities a very considerable share of the attention of philosophers has\nbeen directed. In its ancient and scholastic form, indeed, the subject of Logic\nstands almost exclusively associated with the great name of Aristotle. As it\nwas presented to ancient Greece in the partly technical, partly metaphysical\ndisquisitions of the Organon, such, with scarcely any essential change, it has\ncontinued to the present day. The stream of original inquiry has rather been\ndirected towards questions of general philosophy, which, though they have arisen\namong the disputes of the logicians, have outgrown their origin, and given to\nsuccessive ages of speculation their peculiar bent and character. The eras of\nPorphyry and Proclus, of Anselm and Abelard, of Ramus, and of Descartes,\ntogether with the final protests of Bacon and Locke, rise up before the mind\nas examples of the remoter influences of the study upon the course of human\nthought, partly in suggesting topics fertile of discussion, partly in provoking\nremonstrance against its own undue pretensions. The history of the theory\nof Probabilities, on the other hand, has presented far more of that character of\nsteady growth which belongs to science. In its origin the early genius of Pascal,\u2013\nin its maturer stages of development the most recondite of all the mathematical\nspeculations of Laplace,\u2013were directed to its improvement; to omit here the\nmention of other names scarcely less distinguished than these. As the study of\nLogic has been remarkable for the kindred questions of Metaphysics to which\nit has given occasion, so that of Probabilities also has been remarkable for the\nimpulse which it has bestowed upon the higher departments of mathematical\n1\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 2\nscience. Each of these subjects has, moreover, been justly regarded as having\nrelation to a speculative as well as to a practical end. To enable us to deduce\ncorrect inferences from given premises is not the only object of Logic; nor is it\nthe sole claim of the theory of Probabilities that it teaches us how to establish\nthe business of life assurance on a secure basis; and how to condense whatever\nis valuable in the records of innumerable observations in astronomy, in physics,\nor in that field of social inquiry which is fast assuming a character of great\nimportance. Both these studies have also an interest of another kind, derived\nfrom the light which they shed upon the intellectual powers. They instruct us\nconcerning the mode in which language and number serve as instrumental aids\nto the processes of reasoning; they reveal to us in some degree the connexion\nbetween different powers of our common intellect; they set before us what, in\nthe two domains of demonstrative and of probable knowledge, are the essential\nstandards of truth and correctness,\u2013standards not derived from without, but\ndeeply founded in the constitution of the human faculties. These ends of\nspeculation yield neither in interest nor in dignity, nor yet, it may be added, in\nimportance, to the practical objects, with the pursuit of which they have been\nhistorically associated. To unfold the secret laws and relations of those high\nfaculties of thought by which all beyond the merely perceptive knowledge of the\nworld and of ourselves is attained or matured, is an object which does not stand\nin need of commendation to a rational mind.\n3. But although certain parts of the design of this work have been entertained\nby others, its general conception, its method, and, to a considerable extent,\nits results, are believed to be original. For this reason I shall offer, in the\npresent chapter, some preparatory statements and explanations, in order that\nthe real aim of this treatise may be understood, and the treatment of its subject\nfacilitated.\nIt is designed, in the first place, to investigate the fundamental laws of those\noperations of the mind by which reasoning is performed. It is unnecessary to\nenter here into any argument to prove that the operations of the mind are in\na certain real sense subject to laws, and that a science of the mind is therefore\npossible. If these are questions which admit of doubt, that doubt is not to be\nmet by an endeavour to settle the point of dispute `a priori, but by directing\nthe attention of the objector to the evidence of actual laws, by referring him\nto an actual science. And thus the solution of that doubt would belong not to\nthe introduction to this treatise, but to the treatise itself. Let the assumption\nbe granted, that a science of the intellectual powers is possible, and let us for a\nmoment consider how the knowledge of it is to be obtained.\n4. Like all other sciences, that of the intellectual operations must primarily\nrest upon observation,\u2013the subject of such observation being the very operations\nand processes of which we desire to determine the laws. But while the necessity\nof a foundation in experience is thus a condition common to all sciences, there\nare some special differences between the modes in which this principle becomes\navailable for the determination of general truths when the subject of inquiry is\nthe mind, and when the subject is external nature. To these it is necessary to\ndirect attention.\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 3\nThe general laws of Nature are not, for the most part, immediate objects\nof perception. They are either inductive inferences from a large body of facts,\nthe common truth in which they express, or, in their origin at least, physical\nhypotheses of a causal nature serving to explain ph\u00e6nomena with undeviating\nprecision, and to enable us to predict new combinations of them. They are in all\ncases, and in the strictest sense of the term, probable conclusions, approaching,\nindeed, ever and ever nearer to certainty, as they receive more and more of the\nconfirmation of experience. But of the character of probability, in the strict and\nproper sense of that term, they are never wholly divested. On the other hand,\nthe knowledge of the laws of the mind does not require as its basis any extensive\ncollection of observations. The general truth is seen in the particular instance,\nand it is not confirmed by the repetition of instances. We may illustrate this\nposition by an obvious example. It may be a question whether that formula of\nreasoning, which is called the dictum of Aristotle, de omni et nullo, expresses a\nprimary law of human reasoning or not; but it is no question that it expresses a\ngeneral truth in Logic. Now that truth is made manifest in all its generality by\nreflection upon a single instance of its application. And this is both an evidence\nthat the particular principle or formula in question is founded upon some general\nlaw or laws of the mind, and an illustration of the doctrine that the perception\nof such general truths is not derived from an induction from many instances, but\nis involved in the clear apprehension of a single instance. In connexion with this\ntruth is seen the not less important one that our knowledge of the laws upon\nwhich the science of the intellectual powers rests, whatever may be its extent or\nits deficiency, is not probable knowledge. For we not only see in the particular\nexample the general truth, but we see it also as a certain truth,\u2013a truth, our\nconfidence in which will not continue to increase with increasing experience of\nits practical verifications.\n5. But if the general truths of Logic are of such a nature that when presented\nto the mind they at once command assent, wherein consists the difficulty of\nconstructing the Science of Logic? Not, it may be answered, in collecting the\nmaterials of knowledge, but in discriminating their nature, and determining\ntheir mutual place and relation. All sciences consist of general truths, but of\nthose truths some only are primary and fundamental, others are secondary and\nderived. The laws of elliptic motion, discovered by Kepler, are general truths\nin astronomy, but they are not its fundamental truths. And it is so also in\nthe purely mathematical sciences. An almost boundless diversity of theorems,\nwhich are known, and an infinite possibility of others, as yet unknown, rest\ntogether upon the foundation of a few simple axioms; and yet these are all\ngeneral truths. It may be added, that they are truths which to an intelligence\nsufficiently refined would shine forth in their own unborrowed light, without\nthe need of those connecting links of thought, those steps of wearisome and\noften painful deduction, by which the knowledge of them is actually acquired.\nLet us define as fundamental those laws and principles from which all other\ngeneral truths of science may be deduced, and into which they may all be again\nresolved. Shall we then err in regarding that as the true science of Logic which,\nlaying down certain elementary laws, confirmed by the very testimony of the\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 4\nmind, permits us thence to deduce, by uniform processes, the entire chain of its\nsecondary consequences, and furnishes, for its practical applications, methods\nof perfect generality? Let it be considered whether in any science, viewed either\nas a system of truth or as the foundation of a practical art, there can properly\nbe any other test of the completeness and the fundamental character of its laws,\nthan the completeness of its system of derived truths, and the generality of\nthe methods which it serves to establish. Other questions may indeed present\nthemselves. Convenience, prescription, individual preference, may urge their\nclaims and deserve attention. But as respects the question of what constitutes\nscience in its abstract integrity, I apprehend that no other considerations than\nthe above are properly of any value.\n6. It is designed, in the next place, to give expression in this treatise to the\nfundamental laws of reasoning in the symbolical language of a Calculus. Upon\nthis head it will suffice to say, that those laws are such as to suggest this mode of\nexpression, and to give to it a peculiar and exclusive fitness for the ends in view.\nThere is not only a close analogy between the operations of the mind in general\nreasoning and its operations in the particular science of Algebra, but there is to\na considerable extent an exact agreement in the laws by which the two classes of\noperations are conducted. Of course the laws must in both cases be determined\nindependently; any formal agreement between them can only be established\n`a posteriori by actual comparison. To borrow the notation of the science of\nNumber, and then assume that in its new application the laws by which its use is\ngoverned will remain unchanged, would be mere hypothesis. There exist, indeed,\ncertain general principles founded in the very nature of language, by which the\nuse of symbols, which are but the elements of scientific language, is determined.\nTo a certain extent these elements are arbitrary. Their interpretation is purely\nconventional: we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please. But\nthis permission is limited by two indispensable conditions,\u2013first, that from the\nsense once conventionally established we never, in the same process of reasoning,\ndepart; secondly, that the laws by which the process is conducted be founded\nexclusively upon the above fixed sense or meaning of the symbols employed.\nIn accordance with these principles, any agreement which may be established\nbetween the laws of the symbols of Logic and those of Algebra can but issue\nin an agreement of processes. The two provinces of interpretation remain apart\nand independent, each subject to its own laws and conditions.\nNow the actual investigations of the following pages exhibit Logic, in its\npractical aspect, as a system of processes carried on by the aid of symbols having\na definite interpretation, and subject to laws founded upon that interpretation\nalone. But at the same time they exhibit those laws as identical in form with\nthe laws of the general symbols of algebra, with this single addition, viz., that\nthe symbols of Logic are further subject to a special law (Chap, II.), to which\nthe symbols of quantity, as such, are not subject. Upon the nature and the\nevidence of this law it is not purposed here to dwell. These questions will be\nfully discussed in a future page. But as constituting the essential ground of\ndifference between those forms of inference with which Logic is conversant, and\nthose which present themselves in the particular science of Number, the law in\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 5\nquestion is deserving of more than a passing notice. It may be said that it lies at\nthe very foundation of general reasoning,\u2013that it governs those intellectual acts\nof conception or of imagination which are preliminary to the processes of logical\ndeduction, and that it gives to the processes themselves much of their actual\nform and expression. It may hence be affirmed that this law constitutes the\ngerm or seminal principle, of which every approximation to a general method\nin Logic is the more or less perfect development.\n7. The principle has already been laid down (5) that the sufficiency and truly\nfundamental character of any assumed system of laws in the science of Logic\nmust partly be seen in the perfection of the methods to which they conduct\nus. It remains, then, to consider what the requirements of a general method in\nLogic are, and how far they are fulfilled in the system of the present work.\nLogic is conversant with two kinds of relations,\u2013relations among things,\nand relations among facts. But as facts are expressed by propositions, the\nlatter species of relation may, at least for the purposes of Logic, be resolved\ninto a relation among propositions. The assertion that the fact or event\nA is an invariable consequent of the fact or event B may, to this extent\nat least, be regarded as equivalent to the assertion, that the truth of the\nproposition affirming the occurrence of the event B always implies the truth\nof the proposition affirming the occurrence of the event A. Instead, then,\nof saying that Logic is conversant with relations among things and relations\namong facts, we are permitted to say that it is concerned with relations among\nthings and relations among propositions. Of the former kind of relations we\nhave an example in the proposition\u2013\u201cAll men are mortal;\u201d of the latter kind in\nthe proposition\u2013\u201cIf the sun is totally eclipsed, the stars will become visible.\u201d\nThe one expresses a relation between \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cmortal beings,\u201d the other\nbetween the elementary propositions\u2013\u201cThe sun is totally eclipsed;\u201d \u201cThe stars\nwill become visible.\u201d Among such relations I suppose to be included those which\naffirm or deny existence with respect to things, and those which affirm or deny\ntruth with respect to propositions. Now let those things or those propositions\namong which relation is expressed be termed the elements of the propositions by\nwhich such relation is expressed. Proceeding from this definition, we may then\nsay that the premises of any logical argument express given relations among\ncertain elements, and that the conclusion must express an implied relation\namong those elements, or among a part of them, i.e. a relation implied by or\ninferentially involved in the premises.\n8. Now this being premised, the requirements of a general method in Logic\nseem to be the following:\u2013\n1st. As the conclusion must express a relation among the whole or among\na part of the elements involved in the premises, it is requisite that we should\npossess the means of eliminating those elements which we desire not to appear\nin the conclusion, and of determining the whole amount of relation implied by\nthe premises among the elements which we wish to retain. Those elements\nwhich do not present themselves in the conclusion are, in the language of the\ncommon Logic, called middle terms; and the species of elimination exemplified\nin treatises on Logic consists in deducing from two propositions, containing a\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 6\ncommon element or middle term, a conclusion connecting the two remaining\nterms. But the problem of elimination, as contemplated in this work, possesses\na much wider scope. It proposes not merely the elimination of one middle\nterm from two propositions, but the elimination generally of middle terms from\npropositions, without regard to the number of either of them, or to the nature\nof their connexion. To this object neither the processes of Logic nor those of\nAlgebra, in their actual state, present any strict parallel. In the latter science\nthe problem of elimination is known to be limited in the following manner:\u2013From\ntwo equations we can eliminate one symbol of quantity; from three equations\ntwo symbols; and, generally, from n equations n \u2212 1 symbols. But though this\ncondition, necessary in Algebra, seems to prevail in the existing Logic also, it\nhas no essential place in Logic as a science. There, no relation whatever can be\nproved to prevail between the number of terms to be eliminated and the number\nof propositions from which the elimination is to be effected. From the equation\nrepresenting a single proposition, any number of symbols representing terms\nor elements in Logic may be eliminated; and from any number of equations\nrepresenting propositions, one or any other number of symbols of this kind may\nbe eliminated in a similar manner. For such elimination there exists one general\nprocess applicable to all cases. This is one of the many remarkable consequences\nof that distinguishing law of the symbols of Logic, to which attention has been\nalready directed.\n2ndly. It should be within the province of a general method in Logic\nto express the final relation among the elements of the conclusion by any\nadmissible kind of proposition, or in any selected order of terms. Among\nvarieties of kind we may reckon those which logicians have designated by the\nterms categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive, &c. To a choice or selection in the\norder of the terms, we may refer whatsoever is dependent upon the appearance\nof particular elements in the subject or in the predicate, in the antecedent\nor in the consequent, of that proposition which forms the \u201cconclusion.\u201d But\nwaiving the language of the schools, let us consider what really distinct species\nof problems may present themselves to our notice. We have seen that the\nelements of the final or inferred relation may either be things or propositions.\nSuppose the former case; then it might be required to deduce from the premises\na definition or description of some one thing, or class of things, constituting\nan element of the conclusion in terms of the other things involved in it. Or\nwe might form the conception of some thing or class of things, involving more\nthan one of the elements of the conclusion, and require its expression in terms\nof the other elements. Again, suppose the elements retained in the conclusion\nto be propositions, we might desire to ascertain such points as the following,\nviz., Whether, in virtue of the premises, any of those propositions, taken singly,\nare true or false?\u2013Whether particular combinations of them are true or false?\u2013\nWhether, assuming a particular proposition to be true, any consequences will\nfollow, and if so, what consequences, with respect to the other propositions?\u2013\nWhether any particular condition being assumed with reference to certain of\nthe propositions, any consequences, and what consequences, will follow with\nrespect to the others? and so on. I say that these are general questions, which\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 7\nit should fall within the scope or province of a general method in Logic to solve.\nPerhaps we might include them all under this one statement of the final problem\nof practical Logic. Given a set of premises expressing relations among certain\nelements, whether things or propositions: required explicitly the whole relation\nconsequent among any of those elements under any proposed conditions, and\nin any proposed form. That this problem, under all its aspects, is resolvable,\nwill hereafter appear. But it is not for the sake of noticing this fact, that the\nabove inquiry into the nature and the functions of a general method in Logic\nhas been introduced. It is necessary that the reader should apprehend what are\nthe specific ends of the investigation upon which we are entering, as well as the\nprinciples which are to guide us to the attainment of them.\n9. Possibly it may here be said that the Logic of Aristotle, in its rules\nof syllogism and conversion, sets forth the elementary processes of which all\nreasoning consists, and that beyond these there is neither scope nor occasion\nfor a general method. I have no desire to point out the defects of the common\nLogic, nor do I wish to refer to it any further than is necessary, in order to\nplace in its true light the nature of the present treatise. With this end alone in\nview, I would remark:\u20131st. That syllogism, conversion, &c., are not the ultimate\nprocesses of Logic. It will be shown in this treatise that they are founded upon,\nand are resolvable into, ulterior and more simple processes which constitute the\nreal elements of method in Logic. Nor is it true in fact that all inference is\nreducible to the particular forms of syllogism and conversion.\u2013Vide Chap. xv.\n2ndly. If all inference were reducible to these two processes (and it has been\nmaintained that it is reducible to syllogism alone), there would still exist the\nsame necessity for a general method. For it would still be requisite to determine\nin what order the processes should succeed each other, as well as their particular\nnature, in order that the desired relation should be obtained. By the desired\nrelation I mean that full relation which, in virtue of the premises, connects any\nelements selected out of the premises at will, and which, moreover, expresses that\nrelation in any desired form and order. If we may judge from the mathematical\nsciences, which are the most perfect examples of method known, this directive\nfunction of Method constitutes its chief office and distinction. The fundamental\nprocesses of arithmetic, for instance, are in themselves but the elements of a\npossible science. To assign their nature is the first business of its method, but\nto arrange their succession is its subsequent and higher function. In the more\ncomplex examples of logical deduction, and especially in those which form a\nbasis for the solution of difficult questions in the theory of Probabilities, the aid\nof a directive method, such as a Calculus alone can supply, is indispensable.\n10. Whence it is that the ultimate laws of Logic are mathematical in their\nform; why they are, except in a single point, identical with the general laws of\nNumber; and why in that particular point they differ;\u2013are questions upon which\nit might not be very remote from presumption to endeavour to pronounce a\npositive judgment. Probably they lie beyond the reach of our limited faculties.\nIt may, perhaps, be permitted to the mind to attain a knowledge of the laws to\nwhich it is itself subject, without its being also given to it to understand their\nground and origin, or even, except in a very limited degree, to comprehend their\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 8\nfitness for their end, as compared with other and conceivable systems of law.\nSuch knowledge is, indeed, unnecessary for the ends of science, which properly\nconcerns itself with what is, and seeks not for grounds of preference or reasons\nof appointment. These considerations furnish a sufficient answer to all protests\nagainst the exhibition of Logic in the form of a Calculus. It is not because we\nchoose to assign to it such a mode of manifestation, but because the ultimate\nlaws of thought render that mode possible, and prescribe its character, and\nforbid, as it would seem, the perfect manifestation of the science in any other\nform, that such a mode demands adoption. It is to be remembered that it is the\nbusiness of science not to create laws, but to discover them. We do not originate\nthe constitution of our own minds, greatly as it may be in our power to modify\ntheir character. And as the laws of the human intellect do not depend upon our\nwill, so the forms of the science, of which they constitute the basis, are in all\nessential regards independent of individual choice.\n11. Beside the general statement of the principles of the above method,\nthis treatise will exhibit its application to the analysis of a considerable variety\nof propositions, and of trains of propositions constituting the premises of\ndemonstrative arguments. These examples have been selected from various\nwriters, they differ greatly in complexity, and they embrace a wide range of\nsubjects. Though in this particular respect it may appear to some that too\ngreat a latitude of choice has been exercised, I do not deem it necessary to\noffer any apology upon this account. That Logic, as a science, is susceptible of\nvery wide applications is admitted; but it is equally certain that its ultimate\nforms and processes are mathematical. Any objection `a priori which may\ntherefore be supposed to lie against the adoption of such forms and processes\nin the discussion of a problem of morals or of general philosophy must be\nfounded upon misapprehension or false analogy. It is not of the essence of\nmathematics to be conversant with the ideas of number and quantity. Whether\nas a general habit of mind it would be desirable to apply symbolical processes to\nmoral argument, is another question. Possibly, as I have elsewhere observed,1\nthe perfection of the method of Logic may be chiefly valuable as an evidence\nof the speculative truth of its principles. To supersede the employment of\ncommon reasoning, or to subject it to the rigour of technical forms, would be\nthe last desire of one who knows the value of that intellectual toil and warfare\nwhich imparts to the mind an athletic vigour, and teaches it to contend with\ndifficulties, and to rely upon itself in emergencies. Nevertheless, cases may\narise in which the value of a scientific procedure, even in those things which\nfall confessedly under the ordinary dominion of the reason, may be felt and\nacknowledged. Some examples of this kind will be found in the present work.\n12. The general doctrine and method of Logic above explained form also\nthe basis of a theory and corresponding method of Probabilities. Accordingly,\nthe development of such a theory and method, upon the above principles,\nwill constitute a distinct object of the present treatise. Of the nature of this\napplication it may be desirable to give here some account, more especially as\n1Mathematical Analysis of Logic. London : G. Bell. 1847.\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 9\nregards the character of the solutions to which it leads. In connexion with this\nobject some further detail will be requisite concerning the forms in which the\nresults of the logical analysis are presented.\nThe ground of this necessity of a prior method in Logic, as the basis of a\ntheory of Probabilities, may be stated in a few words. Before we can determine\nthe mode in which the expected frequency of occurrence of a particular event is\ndependent upon the known frequency of occurrence of any other events, we must\nbe acquainted with the mutual dependence of the events themselves. Speaking\ntechnically, we must be able to express the event whose probability is sought,\nas a function of the events whose probabilities are given. Now this explicit\ndetermination belongs in all instances to the department of Logic. Probability,\nhowever, in its mathematical acceptation, admits of numerical measurement.\nHence the subject of Probabilities belongs equally to the science of Number and\nto that of Logic. In recognising the co-ordinate existence of both these elements,\nthe present treatise differs from all previous ones; and as this difference not\nonly affects the question of the possibility of the solution of problems in a large\nnumber of instances, but also introduces new and important elements into the\nsolutions obtained, I deem it necessary to state here, at some length, the peculiar\nconsequences of the theory developed in the following pages.\n13. The measure of the probability of an event is usually defined as a fraction,\nof which the numerator represents the number of cases favourable to the event,\nand the denominator the whole number of cases favourable and unfavourable;\nall cases being supposed equally likely to happen. That definition is adopted\nin the present work. At the same time it is shown that there is another aspect\nof the subject (shortly to be referred to) which might equally be regarded as\nfundamental, and which would actually lead to the same system of methods\nand conclusions. It may be added, that so far as the received conclusions of\nthe theory of Probabilities extend, and so far as they are consequences of its\nfundamental definitions, they do not differ from the results (supposed to be\nequally correct in inference) of the method of this work.\nAgain, although questions in the theory of Probabilities present themselves\nunder various aspects, and may be variously modified by algebraical and other\nconditions, there seems to be one general type to which all such questions, or\nso much of each of them as truly belongs to the theory of Probabilities, may\nbe referred. Considered with reference to the data and the qu\u00e6situm, that type\nmay be described as follows:\u20141st. The data are the probabilities of one or\nmore given events, each probability being either that of the absolute fulfilment\nof the event to which it relates, or the probability of its fulfilment under given\nsupposed conditions. 2ndly. The qu\u00e6situm, or object sought, is the probability\nof the fulfilment, absolutely or conditionally, of some other event differing in\nexpression from those in the data, but more or less involving the same elements.\nAs concerns the data, they are either causally given,\u2014as when the probability\nof a particular throw of a die is deduced from a knowledge of the constitution\nof the piece,\u2014or they are derived from observation of repeated instances of the\nsuccess or failure of events. In the latter case the probability of an event may be\ndefined as the limit toward which the ratio of the favourable to the whole number\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 10\nof observed cases approaches (the uniformity of nature being presupposed) as\nthe observations are indefinitely continued. Lastly, as concerns the nature or\nrelation of the events in question, an important distinction remains. Those\nevents are either simple or compound. By a compound event is meant one of\nwhich the expression in language, or the conception in thought, depends upon\nthe expression or the conception of other events, which, in relation to it, may be\nregarded as simple events. To say \u201cit rains,\u201d or to say \u201cit thunders,\u201d is to express\nthe occurrence of a simple event; but to say \u201cit rains and thunders,\u201d or to say\n\u201cit either rains or thunders,\u201d is to express that of a compound event. For the\nexpression of that event depends upon the elementary expressions, \u201cit rains,\u201d\n\u201cit thunders.\u201d The criterion of simple events is not, therefore, any supposed\nsimplicity in their nature. It is founded solely on the mode of their expression\nin language or conception in thought.\n14. Now one general problem, which the existing theory of Probabilities\nenables us to solve, is the following, viz.:\u2014Given the probabilities of any simple\nevents: required the probability of a given compound event, i.e. of an event\ncompounded in a given manner out of the given simple events. The problem\ncan also be solved when the compound event, whose probability is required,\nis subjected to given conditions, i.e. to conditions dependent also in a given\nmanner on the given simple events. Beside this general problem, there exist\nalso particular problems of which the principle of solution is known. Various\nquestions relating to causes and effects can be solved by known methods\nunder the particular hypothesis that the causes are mutually exclusive, but\napparently not otherwise. Beyond this it is not clear that any advance has been\nmade toward the solution of what may be regarded as the general problem of\nthe science, viz.: Given the probabilities of any events, simple or compound,\nconditioned or unconditioned: required the probability of any other event\nequally arbitrary in expression and conception. In the statement of this\nquestion it is not even postulated that the events whose probabilities are given,\nand the one whose probability is sought, should involve some common elements,\nbecause it is the office of a method to determine whether the data of a problem\nare sufficient for the end in view, and to indicate, when they are not so, wherein\nthe deficiency consists.\nThis problem, in the most unrestricted form of its statement, is resolvable by\nthe method of the present treatise; or, to speak more precisely, its theoretical\nsolution is completely given, and its practical solution is brought to depend\nonly upon processes purely mathematical, such as the resolution and analysis\nof equations. The order and character of the general solution may be thus\ndescribed.\n15. In the first place it is always possible, by the preliminary method of the\nCalculus of Logic, to express the event whose probability is sought as a logical\nfunction of the events whose probabilities are given. The result is of the following\ncharacter: Suppose that X represents the event whose probability is sought, A,\nB, C, &c. the events whose probabilities are given, those events being either\nsimple or compound. Then the whole relation of the event X to the events A,\nB, C, &c. is deduced in the form of what mathematicians term a development,\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 11\nconsisting, in the most general case, of four distinct classes of terms. By the\nfirst class are expressed those combinations of the events A, B, C, which both\nnecessarily accompany and necessarily indicate the occurrence of the event X;\nby the second class, those combinations which necessarily accompany, but do\nnot necessarily imply, the occurrence of the event X; by the third class, those\ncombinations whose occurrence in connexion with the event X is impossible,\nbut not otherwise impossible; by the fourth class, those combinations whose\noccurrence is impossible under any circumstances. I shall not dwell upon this\nstatement of the result of the logical analysis of the problem, further than to\nremark that the elements which it presents are precisely those by which the\nexpectation of the event X, as dependent upon our knowledge of the events A, B,\nC, is, or alone can be, affected. General reasoning would verify this conclusion;\nbut general reasoning would not usually avail to disentangle the complicated\nweb events and circumstances from which the solution above described must be\nevolved. The attainment of this object constitutes the first step towards the\ncomplete solution of the question I proposed. It is to be noted that thus far the\nprocess of solution is logical, i. e. conducted by symbols of logical significance,\nand resulting in an equation interpretable into a proposition. Let this result be\ntermed the final logical equation.\nThe second step of the process deserves attentive remark. From the final\nlogical equation to which the previous step has conducted us, are deduced,\nby inspection, a series of algebraic equations implicitly involving the complete\nsolution of the problem proposed. Of the mode in which this transition is\neffected let it suffice to say, that there exists a definite relation between the laws\nby which the probabilities of events are expressed as algebraic functions of the\nprobabilities of other events upon which they depend, and the laws by which\nthe logical connexion of the events is itself expressed. This relation, like the\nother coincidences of formal law which have been referred to, is not founded\nupon hypothesis, but is made known to us by observation (I.4), and reflection.\nIf, however, its reality were assumed `a priori as the basis of the very definition\nof Probability, strict deduction would thence lead us to the received numerical\ndefinition as a necessary consequence. The Theory of Probabilities stands, as\nit has already been remarked (I.12), in equally close relation to Logic and to\nArithmetic; and it is indifferent, so far as results are concerned, whether we\nregard it as springing out of the latter of these sciences, or as founded in the\nmutual relations which connect the two together.\n16. There are some circumstances, interesting perhaps to the mathematician,\nattending the general solutions deduced by the above method, which it may be\ndesirable to notice.\n1st. As the method is independent of the number and the nature of the\ndata, it continues to be applicable when the latter are insufficient to render\ndeterminate the value sought. When such is the case, the final expression of the\nsolution will contain terms with arbitrary constant coefficients. To such terms\nthere will correspond terms in the final logical equation (I. 15), the interpretation\nof which will inform us what new data are requisite in order to determine the\nvalues of those constants, and thus render the numerical solution complete.\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 12\nIf such data are not to be obtained, we can still, by giving to the constants\ntheir limiting values 0 and 1, determine the limits within which the probability\nsought must lie independently of all further experience. When the event whose\nprobability is sought is quite independent of those whose probabilities are given,\nthe limits thus obtained for its value will be 0 and 1, as it is evident that they\nought to be, and the interpretation of the constants will only lead to a re-\nstatement of the original problem.\n2ndly. The expression of the final solution will in all cases involve a particular\nelement of quantity, determinable by the solution of an algebraic equation. Now\nwhen that equation is of an elevated degree, a difficulty may seem to arise as\nto the selection of the proper root. There are, indeed, cases in which both the\nelements given and the element sought are so obviously restricted by necessary\nconditions that no choice remains. But in complex instances the discovery of\nsuch conditions, by unassisted force of reasoning, would be hopeless. A distinct\nmethod is requisite for this end,\u2014a method which might not appropriately be\ntermed the Calculus of Statistical Conditions, into the nature of this method\nI shall not here further enter than to say, that, like the previous method, it is\nbased upon the employment of the \u201cfinal logical equation,\u201d and that it definitely\nassigns, 1st, the conditions which must be fulfilled among the numerical elements\nof the data, in order that the problem may be real, i.e. derived from a possible\nexperience; 2ndly, the numerical limits, within which the probability sought\nmust have been confined, if, instead of being determined by theory, it had been\ndeduced directly by observation from the same system of ph\u00e6nomena from\nwhich the data were derived. It is clear that these limits will be actual limits of\nthe probability sought. Now, on supposing the data subject to the conditions\nabove assigned to them, it appears in every instance which I have examined that\nthere exists one root, and only one root, of the final algebraic equation which is\nsubject to the required limitations. Every source of ambiguity is thus removed.\nIt would even seem that new truths relating to the theory of algebraic equations\nare thus incidentally brought to light. It is remarkable that the special element\nof quantity, to which the previous discussion relates, depends only upon the\ndata, and not at all upon the qu\u00e6situm of the problem proposed. Hence the\nsolution of each particular problem unties the knot of difficulty for a system of\nproblems, viz., for that system of problems which is marked by the possession of\ncommon data, independently of the nature of their qu\u00e6sita. This circumstance\nis important whenever from a particular system of data it is required to deduce a\nseries of connected conclusions. And it further gives to the solutions of particular\nproblems that character of relationship, derived from their dependence upon a\ncentral and fundamental unity, which not unfrequently marks the application\nof general methods.\n17. But though the above considerations, with others of a like nature, justify\nthe assertion that the method of this treatise, for the solution of questions in the\ntheory of Probabilities, is a general method, it does not thence follow that we are\nrelieved in all cases from the necessity of recourse to hypothetical grounds. It has\nbeen observed that a solution may consist entirely of terms affected by arbitrary\nconstant coefficients,\u2014may, in fact, be wholly indefinite. The application of\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 13\nthe method of this work to some of the most important questions within its\nrange would\u2013were the data of experience alone employed\u2013present results of this\ncharacter. To obtain a definite solution it is necessary, in such cases, to have\nrecourse to hypotheses possessing more or less of independent probability, but\nincapable of exact verification. Generally speaking, such hypotheses will differ\nfrom the immediate results of experience in partaking of a logical rather than\nof a numerical character; in prescribing the conditions under which ph\u00e6nomena\noccur, rather than assigning the relative frequency of their occurrence. This\ncircumstance is, however, unimportant. Whatever their nature may be, the\nhypotheses assumed must thenceforth be regarded as belonging to the actual\ndata, although tending, as is obvious, to give to the solution itself somewhat of a\nhypothetical character. With this understanding as to the possible sources of the\ndata actually employed, the method is perfectly general, but for the correctness\nof the hypothetical elements introduced it is of course no more responsible than\nfor the correctness of the numerical data derived from experience.\nIn illustration of these remarks we may observe that the theory of the\nreduction of astronomical observations2 rests, in part, upon hypothetical\ngrounds. It assumes certain positions as to the nature of error, the equal\nprobabilities of its occurrence in the form of excess or defect, &c., without\nwhich it would be impossible to obtain any definite conclusions from a system\nof conflicting observations. But granting such positions as the above, the\nresidue of the investigation falls strictly within the province of the theory\nof Probabilities. Similar observations apply to the important problem which\nproposes to deduce from the records of the majorities of a deliberative assembly\nthe mean probability of correct judgment in one of its members. If the method\nof this treatise be applied to the mere numerical data, the solution obtained is\nof that wholly indefinite kind above described. And to show in a more eminent\ndegree the insufficiency of those data by themselves, the interpretation of the\narbitrary constants (I. 16) which appear in the solution, merely produces a\nre-statement of the original problem. Admitting, however, the hypothesis of\nthe independent formation of opinion in the individual mind, either absolutely,\nas in the speculations of Laplace and Poisson, or under limitations imposed\nby the actual data, as will be seen in this treatise, Chap. XXI., the problem\nassumes a far more definite character. It will be manifest that the ulterior\nvalue of the theory of Probabilities must depend very much upon the correct\nformation of such mediate hypotheses, where the purely experimental data are\ninsufficient for definite solution, and where that further experience indicated by\nthe interpretation of the final logical equation is unattainable. Upon the other\nhand, an undue readiness to form hypotheses in subjects which from their very\nnature are placed beyond human ken, must re-act upon the credit of the theory\nof Probabilities, and tend to throw doubt in the general mind over its most\nlegitimate conclusions.\n18. It would, perhaps, be premature to speculate here upon the question\n2The author designs to treat this subject either in a separate work or in a future Appendix.\nIn the present treatise he avoids the use of the integral calculus.\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 14\nwhether the methods of abstract science are likely at any future day to render\nservice in the investigation of social problems at all commensurate with those\nwhich they have rendered in various departments of physical inquiry. An\nattempt to resolve this question upon pure `a priori grounds of reasoning would\nbe very likely to mislead us. For example, the consideration of human free-\nagency would seem at first sight to preclude the idea that the movements\nof the social system should ever manifest that character of orderly evolution\nwhich we are prepared to expect under the reign of a physical necessity. Yet\nalready do the researches of the statist reveal to us facts at variance with such\nan anticipation. Thus the records of crime and pauperism present a degree\nof regularity unknown in regions in which the disturbing influence of human\nwants and passions is unfelt. On the other hand, the distemperature of seasons,\nthe eruption of volcanoes, the spread of blight in the vegetable, or of epidemic\nmaladies in the animal kingdom, things apparently or chiefly the product\nof natural causes, refuse to be submitted to regular and apprehensible laws.\n\u201cFickle as the wind,\u201d is a proverbial expression. Reflection upon these points\nteaches us in some degree to correct our earlier judgments. We learn that we are\nnot to expect, under the dominion of necessity, an order perceptible to human\nobservation, unless the play of its producing causes is sufficiently simple; nor, on\nthe other hand, to deem that free agency in the individual is inconsistent with\nregularity in the motions of the system of which he forms a component unit.\nHuman freedom stands out as an apparent fact of our consciousness, while it\nis also, I conceive, a highly probable deduction of analogy (Chap, XXII.) from\nthe nature of that portion of the mind whose scientific constitution we are able\nto investigate. But whether accepted as a fact reposing on consciousness, or\nas a conclusion sanctioned by the reason, it must be so interpreted as not to\nconflict with an established result of observation, viz.: that ph\u00e6nomena, in the\nproduction of which large masses of men are concerned, do actually exhibit a\nvery remarkable degree of regularity, enabling us to collect in each succeeding\nage the elements upon which the estimate of its state and progress, so far as\nmanifested in outward results, must depend. There is thus no sound objection\n`a priori against the possibility of that species of data which is requisite for\nthe experimental foundation of a science of social statistics. Again, whatever\nother object this treatise may accomplish, it is presumed that it will leave no\ndoubt as to the existence of a system of abstract principles and of methods\nfounded upon those principles, by which any collective body of social data may\nbe made to yield, in an explicit form, whatever information they implicitly\ninvolve. There may, where the data are exceedingly complex, be very great\ndifficulty in obtaining this information,\u2014difficulty due not to any imperfection\nof the theory, but to the laborious character of the analytical processes to which\nit points. It is quite conceivable that in many instances that difficulty may be\nsuch as only united effort could overcome. But that we possess theoretically\nin all cases, and practically, so far as the requisite labour of calculation may\nbe supplied, the means of evolving from statistical records the seeds of general\ntruths which lie buried amid the mass of figures, is a position which may, I\nconceive, with perfect safety be affirmed.\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 15\n19. But beyond these general positions I do not venture to speak in terms of\nassurance. Whether the results which might be expected from the application\nof scientific methods to statistical records, over and above those the discovery of\nwhich requires no such aid, would so far compensate for the labour involved as\nto render it worth while to institute such investigations upon a proper scale of\nmagnitude, is a point which could, perhaps, only be determined by experience.\nIt is to be desired, and it might without great presumption be expected, that in\nthis, as in other instances, the abstract doctrines of science should minister to\nmore than intellectual gratification. Nor, viewing the apparent order in which\nthe sciences have been evolved, and have successively contributed their aid to\nthe service of mankind, does it seem very improbable that a day may arrive in\nwhich similar aid may accrue from departments of the field of knowledge yet\nmore intimately allied with the elements of human welfare. Let the speculations\nof this treatise, however, rest at present simply upon their claim to be regarded\nas true.\n20. I design, in the last place, to endeavour to educe from the scientific\nresults of the previous inquiries some general intimations respecting the nature\nand constitution of the human mind. Into the grounds of the possibility of\nthis species of inference it is not necessary to enter here. One or two general\nobservations may serve to indicate the track which I shall endeavour to follow. It\ncannot but be admitted that our views of the science of Logic must materially\ninfluence, perhaps mainly determine, our opinions upon the nature of the\nintellectual faculties. For example, the question whether reasoning consists\nmerely in the application of certain first or necessary truths, with which the\nmind has been originally imprinted, or whether the mind is itself a seat of\nlaw, whose operation is as manifest and as conclusive in the particular as in\nthe general formula, or whether, as some not undistinguished writers seem to\nmaintain, all reasoning is of particulars; this question, I say, is one which not\nmerely affects the science of Logic, but also concerns the formation of just views\nof the constitution of the intellectual faculties. Again, if it is concluded that\nthe mind is by original constitution a seat of law, the question of the nature\nof its subjection to this law,\u2014whether, for instance, it is an obedience founded\nupon necessity, like that which sustains the revolutions of the heavens, and\npreserves the order of Nature,\u2014or whether it is a subjection of some quite\ndistinct kind, is also a matter of deep speculative interest. Further, if the\nmind is truly determined to be a subject of law, and if its laws also are truly\nassigned, the question of their probable or necessary influence upon the course\nof human thought in different ages is one invested with great importance, and\nwell deserving a patient investigation, as matter both of philosophy and of\nhistory. These and other questions I propose, however imperfectly, to discuss\nin the concluding portion of the present work. They belong, perhaps, to the\ndomain of probable or conjectural, rather than to that of positive, knowledge.\nBut it may happen that where there is not sufficient warrant for the certainties\nof science, there may be grounds of analogy adequate for the suggestion of\nhighly probable opinions. It has seemed to me better that this discussion\nshould be entirely reserved for the sequel of the main business of this treatise,\u2014\nCHAPTER I. NATURE AND DESIGN OF THIS WORK 16\nwhich is the investigation of scientific truths and laws. Experience sufficiently\ninstructs us that the proper order of advancement in all inquiries after truth\nis to proceed from the known to the unknown. There are parts, even of the\nphilosophy and constitution of the human mind, which have been placed fully\nwithin the reach of our investigation. To make a due acquaintance with those\nportions of our nature the basis of all endeavours to penetrate amid the shadows\nand uncertainties of that conjectural realm which lies beyond and above them,\nis the course most accordant with the limitations of our present condition.\nChapter II\nOF SIGNS IN GENERAL, AND OF THE SIGNS\nAPPROPRIATE TO THE SCIENCE OF LOGIC IN\nPARTICULAR; ALSO OF THE LAWS TO WHICH\nTHAT CLASS OF SIGNS ARE SUBJECT.\n1. That Language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium\nfor the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted. It is proposed in\nthis chapter to inquire what it is that renders Language thus subservient to\nthe most important of our intellectual faculties. In the various steps of this\ninquiry we shall be led to consider the constitution of Language, considered as\na system adapted to an end or purpose; to investigate its elements; to seek to\ndetermine their mutual relation and dependence; and to inquire in what manner\nthey contribute to the attainment of the end to which, as co-ordinate parts of\na system, they have respect.\nIn proceeding to these inquiries, it will not be necessary to enter into the\ndiscussion of that famous question of the schools, whether Language is to be\nregarded as an essential instrument of reasoning, or whether, on the other hand,\nit is possible for us to reason without its aid. I suppose this question to be beside\nthe design of the present treatise, for the following reason, viz., that it is the\nbusiness of Science to investigate laws; and that, whether we regard signs as\nthe representatives of things and of their relations, or as the representatives\nof the conceptions and operations of the human intellect, in studying the laws\nof signs, we are in effect studying the manifested laws of reasoning. If there\nexists a difference between the two inquiries, it is one which does not affect the\nscientific expressions of formal law, which are the object of investigation in the\npresent stage of this work, but relates only to the mode in which those results\nare presented to the mental regard. For though in investigating the laws of\nsigns, `a posteriori, the immediate subject of examination is Language, with the\nrules which govern its use; while in making the internal processes of thought\nthe direct object of inquiry, we appeal in a more immediate way to our personal\nconsciousness,\u2014it will be found that in both cases the results obtained are\nformally equivalent. Nor could we easily conceive, that the unnumbered tongues\nand dialects of the earth should have preserved through a long succession of ages\nso much that is common and universal, were we not assured of the existence of\n17\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 18\nsome deep foundation of their agreement in the laws of the mind itself.\n2. The elements of which all language consists are signs or symbols.\nWords are signs. Sometimes they are said to represent things; sometimes the\noperations by which the mind combines together the simple notions of things\ninto complex conceptions; sometimes they express the relations of action,\npassion, or mere quality, which we perceive to exist among the objects of\nour experience; sometimes the emotions of the perceiving mind. But words,\nalthough in this and in other ways they fulfil the office of signs, or representative\nsymbols, are not the only signs which we are capable of employing. Arbitrary\nmarks, which speak only to the eye, and arbitrary sounds or actions, which\naddress themselves to some other sense, are equally of the nature of signs,\nprovided that their representative office is defined and understood. In the\nmathematical sciences, letters, and the symbols +, \u2212, =, &c., are used as\nsigns, although the term \u201csign\u201d is applied to the latter class of symbols, which\nrepresent operations or relations, rather than to the former, which represent\nthe elements of number and quantity. As the real import of a sign does not in\nany way depend upon its particular form or expression, so neither do the laws\nwhich determine its use. In the present treatise, however, it is with written\nsigns that we have to do, and it is with reference to these exclusively that the\nterm \u201csign\u201d will be employed. The essential properties of signs are enumerated\nin the following definition.\nDefinition.\u2014A sign is an arbitrary mark, having a fixed interpretation, and\nsusceptible of combination with other signs in subjection to fixed laws dependent\nupon their mutual interpretation.\n3. Let us consider the particulars involved in the above definition separately.\n(1.) In the first place, a sign is an arbitrary mark. It is clearly indifferent\nwhat particular word or token we associate with a given idea, provided that\nthe association once made is permanent. The Romans expressed by the word\n\u201ccivitas\u201d what we designate by the word \u201cstate.\u201d But both they and we might\nequally well have employed any other word to represent the same conception.\nNothing, indeed, in the nature of Language would prevent us from using a mere\nletter in the same sense. Were this done, the laws according to which that letter\nwould require to be used would be essentially the same with the laws which\ngovern the use of \u201ccivitas\u201d in the Latin, and of \u201cstate\u201d in the English language,\nso far at least as the use of those words is regulated by any general principles\ncommon to all languages alike.\n(2.) In the second place, it is necessary that each sign should possess, within\nthe limits of the same discourse or process of reasoning, a fixed interpretation.\nThe necessity of this condition is obvious, and seems to be founded in the very\nnature of the subject. There exists, however, a dispute as to the precise nature\nof the representative office of words or symbols used as names in the processes of\nreasoning. By some it is maintained, that they represent the conceptions of the\nmind alone; by others, that they represent things. The question is not of great\nimportance here, as its decision cannot affect the laws according to which signs\nare employed. I apprehend, however, that the general answer to this and such\nlike questions is, that in the processes of reasoning, signs stand in the place and\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 19\nfulfil the office of the conceptions and operations of the mind; but that as those\nconceptions and operations represent things, and the connexions and relations of\nthings, so signs represent things with their connexions and relations; and lastly,\nthat as signs stand in the place of the conceptions and operations of the mind,\nthey are subject to the laws of those conceptions and operations. This view will\nbe more fully elucidated in the next chapter; but it here serves to explain the\nthird of those particulars involved in the definition of a sign, viz., its subjection\nto fixed laws of combination depending upon the nature of its interpretation.\n4. The analysis and classification of those signs by which the operations of\nreasoning are conducted will be considered in the following Proposition:\nProposition I.\nAll the operations of Language, as an instrument of reasoning, may be\nconducted by a system of signs composed of the following elements, viz.:\n1st. Literal symbols, as x, y, &c., representing things as subjects of our\nconceptions.\n2nd. Signs of operation, as +, \u2212, \u00d7, standing for those operations of the\nmind by which the conceptions of things are combined or resolved so as to form\nnew conceptions involving the same elements.\n3rd. The sign of identity, =.\nAnd these symbols of Logic are in their use subject to definite laws, partly\nagreeing with and partly differing from the laws of the corresponding symbols in\nthe science of Algebra.\nLet it be assumed as a criterion of the true elements of rational discourse,\nthat they should be susceptible of combination in the simplest forms and by\nthe simplest laws, and thus combining should generate all other known and\nconceivable forms of language; and adopting this principle, let the following\nclassification be considered.\nclass i.\n5. Appellative or descriptive signs, expressing either the name of a thing, or\nsome quality or circumstance belonging to it.\nTo this class we may obviously refer the substantive proper or common, and\nthe adjective. These may indeed be regarded as differing only in this respect,\nthat the former expresses the substantive existence of the individual thing or\nthings to which it refers; the latter implies that existence. If we attach to the\nadjective the universally understood subject \u201cbeing\u201d or \u201cthing,\u201d it becomes\nvirtually a substantive, and may for all the essential purposes of reasoning be\nreplaced by the substantive. Whether or not, in every particular of the mental\nregard, it is the same thing to say, \u201cWater is a fluid thing,\u201d as to say, \u201cWater is\nfluid;\u201d it is at least equivalent in the expression of the processes of reasoning.\nIt is clear also, that to the above class we must refer any sign which\nmay conventionally be used to express some circumstance or relation, the\ndetailed exposition of which would involve the use of many signs. The\nepithets of poetic diction are very frequently of this kind. They are usually\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 20\ncompounded adjectives, singly fulfilling the office of a many-worded description.\nHomer\u2019s \u201cdeep-eddying ocean\u201d embodies a virtual description in the single word\n\u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2. And conventionally any other description addressed either to the\nimagination or to the intellect might equally be represented by a single sign,\nthe use of which would in all essential points be subject to the same laws as\nthe use of the adjective \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cgreat.\u201d Combined with the subject \u201cthing,\u201d\nsuch a sign would virtually become a substantive; and by a single substantive\nthe combined meaning both of thing and quality might be expressed.\n6. Now, as it has been defined that a sign is an arbitrary mark, it is\npermissible to replace all signs of the species above described by letters. Let\nus then agree to represent the class of individuals to which a particular name\nor description is applicable, by a single letter, as x. If the name is \u201cmen,\u201d\nfor instance, let x represent \u201call men,\u201d or the class \u201cmen.\u201d By a class is\nusually meant a collection of individuals, to each of which a particular name\nor description may be applied; but in this work the meaning of the term will\nbe extended so as to include the case in which but a single individual exists,\nanswering to the required name or description, as well as the cases denoted by\nthe terms \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201cuniverse,\u201d which as \u201cclasses\u201d should be understood\nto comprise respectively \u201cno beings,\u201d \u201call beings.\u201d Again, if an adjective, as\n\u201cgood,\u201d is employed as a term of description, let us represent by a letter, as y,\nall things to which the description \u201cgood\u201d is applicable, i.e. \u201call good things,\u201d\nor the class \u201cgood things.\u201d Let it further be agreed, that by the combination\nxy shall be represented that class of things to which the names or descriptions\nrepresented by x and y are simultaneously applicable. Thus, if x alone stands\nfor \u201cwhite things,\u201d and y for \u201csheep,\u201d let xy stand for \u201cwhite sheep;\u201d and in\nlike manner, if z stand for \u201chorned things,\u201d and x and y retain their previous\ninterpretations, let zxy represent \u201chorned white sheep,\u201d i.e. that collection of\nthings to which the name \u201csheep,\u201d and the descriptions \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201chorned\u201d\nare together applicable.\nLet us now consider the laws to which the symbols x, y, &c., used in the\nabove sense, are subject.\n7. First, it is evident, that according to the above combinations, the order in\nwhich two symbols are written is indifferent. The expressions xy and yx equally\nrepresent that class of things to the several members of which the names or\ndescriptions x and y are together applicable. Hence we have,\nxy = yx. (1)\nIn the case of x representing white things, and y sheep, either of the members\nof this equation will represent the class of \u201cwhite sheep.\u201d There may be a\ndifference as to the order in which the conception is formed, but there is\nnone as to the individual things which are comprehended under it. In like\nmanner, if x represent \u201cestuaries,\u201d and y \u201crivers,\u201d the expressions xy and yx will\nindifferently represent \u201crivers that are estuaries,\u201d or \u201cestuaries that are rivers,\u201d\nthe combination in this case being in ordinary language that of two substantives,\ninstead of that of a substantive and an adjective as in the previous instance.\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 21\nLet there be a third symbol, as z, representing that class of things to which the\nterm \u201cnavigable\u201d is applicable, and any one of the following expressions,\nzxy, zyx, xyz, &c.,\nwill represent the class of \u201cnavigable rivers that are estuaries.\u201d\nIf one of the descriptive terms should have some implied reference to another,\nit is only necessary to include that reference expressly in its stated meaning, in\norder to render the above remarks still applicable. Thus, if x represent \u201cwise\u201d\nand y \u201ccounsellor,\u201d we shall have to define whether x implies wisdom in the\nabsolute sense, or only the wisdom of counsel. With such definition the law\nxy = yx continues to be valid.\nWe are permitted, therefore, to employ the symbols x, y, z, &c., in the place\nof the substantives, adjectives, and descriptive phrases subject to the rule of\ninterpretation, that any expression in which several of these symbols are written\ntogether shall represent all the objects or individuals to which their several\nmeanings are together applicable, and to the law that the order in which the\nsymbols succeed each other is indifferent.\nAs the rule of interpretation has been sufficiently exemplified, I shall deem it\nunnecessary always to express the subject \u201cthings\u201d in defining the interpretation\nof a symbol used for an adjective. When I say, let x represent \u201cgood,\u201d it will\nbe understood that x only represents \u201cgood\u201d when a subject for that quality\nis supplied by another symbol, and that, used alone, its interpretation will be\n\u201cgood things.\u201d\n8. Concerning the law above determined, the following observations, which\nwill also be more or less appropriate to certain other laws to be deduced\nhereafter, may be added.\nFirst, I would remark, that this law is a law of thought, and not, properly\nspeaking, a law of things. Difference in the order of the qualities or attributes\nof an object, apart from all questions of causation, is a difference in conception\nmerely. The law (1) expresses as a general truth, that the same thing may be\nconceived in different ways, and states the nature of that difference; and it does\nno more than this.\nSecondly, As a law of thought, it is actually developed in a law of Language,\nthe product and the instrument of thought. Though the tendency of prose\nwriting is toward uniformity, yet even there the order of sequence of adjectives\nabsolute in their meaning, and applied to the same subject, is indifferent, but\npoetic diction borrows much of its rich diversity from the extension of the same\nlawful freedom to the substantive also. The language of Milton is peculiarly\ndistinguished by this species of variety. Not only does the substantive often\nprecede the adjectives by which it is qualified, but it is frequently placed in\ntheir midst. In the first few lines of the invocation to Light, we meet with such\nexamples as the following:\n\u201cOffspring of heaven first-born.\u201d\n\u201cThe rising world of waters dark and deep.\u201d\n\u201cBright effluence of bright essence increate.\u201d\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 22\nNow these inverted forms are not simply the fruits of a poetic license. They\nare the natural expressions of a freedom sanctioned by the intimate laws of\nthought, but for reasons of convenience not exercised in the ordinary use of\nlanguage.\nThirdly, The law expressed by (1) may be characterized by saying that the\nliteral symbols x, y, z, are commutative, like the symbols of Algebra. In saying\nthis, it is not affirmed that the process of multiplication in Algebra, of which\nthe fundamental law is expressed by the equation\nxy = yx,\npossesses in itself any analogy with that process of logical combination which\nxy has been made to represent above; but only that if the arithmetical and the\nlogical process are expressed in the same manner, their symbolical expressions\nwill be subject to the same formal law. The evidence of that subjection is in\nthe two cases quite distinct.\n9. As the combination of two literal symbols in the form xy expresses the\nwhole of that class of objects to which the names or qualities represented by x\nand y are together applicable, it follows that if the two symbols have exactly\nthe same signification, their combination expresses no more than either of the\nsymbols taken alone would do. In such case we should therefore have\nxy = x.\nAs y is, however, supposed to have the same meaning as x, we may replace it\nin the above equation by x, and we thus get\nxx = x.\nNow in common Algebra the combination xx is more briefly represented by x2.\nLet us adopt the same principle of notation here; for the mode of expressing a\nparticular succession of mental operations is a thing in itself quite as arbitrary\nas the mode of expressing a single idea or operation (II. 3). In accordance with\nthis notation, then, the above equation assumes the form\nx2 = x, (2)\nand is, in fact, the expression of a second general law of those symbols by which\nnames, qualities, or descriptions, are symbolically represented.\nThe reader must bear in mind that although the symbols x and y in the\nexamples previously formed received significations distinct from each other,\nnothing prevents us from attributing to them precisely the same signification.\nIt is evident that the more nearly their actual significations approach to each\nother, the more nearly does the class of things denoted by the combination xy\napproach to identity with the class denoted by x, as well as with that denoted by\ny. The case supposed in the demonstration of the equation (2) is that of absolute\nidentity of meaning. The law which it expresses is practically exemplified in\nlanguage. To say \u201cgood, good,\u201d in relation to any subject, though a cumbrous\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 23\nand useless pleonasm, is the same as to say \u201cgood.\u201d Thus \u201cgood, good\u201d men,\nis equivalent to \u201cgood\u201d men. Such repetitions of words are indeed sometimes\nemployed to heighten a quality or strengthen an affirmation. But this effect is\nmerely secondary and conventional; it is not founded in the intrinsic relations\nof language and thought. Most of the operations which we observe in nature, or\nperform ourselves, are of such a kind that their effect is augmented by repetition,\nand this circumstance prepares us to expect the same thing in language, and\neven to use repetition when we design to speak with emphasis. But neither\nin strict reasoning nor in exact discourse is there any just ground for such a\npractice.\n10. We pass now to the consideration of another class of the signs of speech,\nand of the laws connected with their use.\nclass ii.\n11. Signs of those mental operations whereby we collect parts into a whole,\nor separate a whole into its parts.\nWe are not only capable of entertaining the conceptions of objects, as\ncharacterized by names, qualities, or circumstances, applicable to each individual\nof the group under consideration, but also of forming the aggregate conception\nof a group of objects consisting of partial groups, each of which is separately\nnamed or described. For this purpose we use the conjunctions \u201cand,\u201d \u201cor,\u201d\n&c. \u201cTrees and minerals,\u201d \u201cbarren mountains, or fertile vales,\u201d are examples of\nthis kind. In strictness, the words \u201cand,\u201d \u201cor,\u201d interposed between the terms\ndescriptive of two or more classes of objects, imply that those classes are quite\ndistinct, so that no member of one is found in another. In this and in all other\nrespects the words \u201cand\u201d \u201cor\u201d are analogous with the sign + in algebra, and\ntheir laws are identical. Thus the expression \u201cmen and women\u201d is, conventional\nmeanings set aside, equivalent with the expression \u201cwomen and men.\u201d Let x\nrepresent \u201cmen,\u201d y, \u201cwomen;\u201d and let + stand for \u201cand \u201d and \u201cor,\u201d then we\nhave\nx + y = y + x, (3)\nan equation which would equally hold true if x and y represented numbers, and\n+ were the sign of arithmetical addition.\nLet the symbol z stand for the adjective \u201cEuropean,\u201d then since it is, in\neffect, the same thing to say \u201cEuropean men and women,\u201d as to say \u201cEuropean\nmen and European women,\u201d we have\nz (x + y) = zx + zy. (4)\nAnd this equation also would be equally true were x, y, and z symbols of number,\nand were the juxtaposition of two literal symbols to represent their algebraic\nproduct, just as in the logical signification previously given, it represents the\nclass of objects to which both the epithets conjoined belong.\nThe above are the laws which govern the use of the sign +, here used to\ndenote the positive operation of aggregating parts into a whole. But the very\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 24\nidea of an operation effecting some positive change seems to suggest to us the\nidea of an opposite or negative operation, having the effect of undoing what\nthe former one has done. Thus we cannot conceive it possible to collect parts\ninto a whole, and not conceive it also possible to separate a part from a whole.\nThis operation we express in common language by the sign except, as, \u201cAll men\nexcept Asiatics,\u201d \u201cAll states except those which are monarchical.\u201d Here it is\nimplied that the things excepted form a part of the things from which they are\nexcepted. As we have expressed the operation of aggregation by the sign +, so\nwe may express the negative operation above described by \u2212 minus. Thus if x be\ntaken to represent men, and y, Asiatics, i. e. Asiatic men, then the conception\nof \u201cAll men except Asiatics\u201d will be expressed by x \u2212 y. And if we represent\nby x, \u201cstates,\u201d and by y the descriptive property \u201chaving a monarchical form,\u201d\nthen the conception of \u201cAll states except those which are monarchical\u201d will be\nexpressed by x \u2212 xy.\nAs it is indifferent for all the essential purposes of reasoning whether we\nexpress excepted cases first or last in the order of speech, it is also indifferent in\nwhat order we write any series of terms, some of which are affected by the sign\n\u2212. Thus we have, as in the common algebra,\nx \u2212 y = \u2212y + x. (5)\nStill representing by x the class \u201cmen,\u201d and by y \u201cAsiatics,\u201d let z represent the\nadjective \u201cwhite.\u201d Now to apply the adjective \u201cwhite\u201d to the collection of men\nexpressed by the phrase \u201cMen except Asiatics,\u201d is the same as to say, \u201cWhite\nmen, except white Asiatics.\u201d Hence we have\nz (x \u2212 y) = zx \u2212 zy. (6)\nThis is also in accordance with the laws of ordinary algebra.\nThe equations (4) and (6) may be considered as exemplification of a single\ngeneral law, which may be stated by saying, that the literal symbols, x, y, z, &c.\nare distributive in their operation. The general fact which that law expresses is\nthis, viz.:\u2014If any quality or circumstance is ascribed to all the members of a\ngroup, formed either by aggregation or exclusion of partial groups, the resulting\nconception is the same as if the quality or circumstance were first ascribed to\neach member of the partial groups, and the aggregation or exclusion effected\nafterwards. That which is ascribed to the members of the whole is ascribed to\nthe members of all its parts, howsoever those parts are connected together.\nclass iii.\n12. Signs by which relation is expressed, and by which we form propositions.\nThough all verbs may with propriety be referred to this class, it is sufficient\nfor the purposes of Logic to consider it as including only the substantive verb\nis or are, since every other verb may be resolved into this element, and one of\nthe signs included under Class I. For as those signs are used to express quality\nor circumstance of every kind, they may be employed to express the active or\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 25\npassive relation of the subject of the verb, considered with reference either to\npast, to present, or to future time. Thus the Proposition, \u201cC\u00e6sar conquered\nthe Gauls,\u201d may be resolved into \u201cC\u00e6sar is he who conquered the Gauls.\u201d The\nground of this analysis I conceive to be the following:\u2014Unless we understand\nwhat is meant by having conquered the Gauls, i.e. by the expression \u201cOne\nwho conquered the Gauls,\u201d we cannot understand the sentence in question. It\nis, therefore, truly an element of that sentence; another element is \u201cC\u00e6sar,\u201d\nand there is yet another required, the copula is to show the connexion of these\ntwo. I do not, however, affirm that there is no other mode than the above of\ncontemplating the relation expressed by the proposition, \u201cC\u00e6sar conquered the\nGauls;\u201d but only that the analysis here given is a correct one for the particular\npoint of view which has been taken, and that it suffices for the purposes of\nlogical deduction. It may be remarked that the passive and future participles of\nthe Greek language imply the existence of the principle which has been asserted,\nviz.: that the sign is or are may be regarded as an element of every personal\nverb.\n13. The above sign, is or are may be expressed by the symbol =. The laws,\nor as would usually be said, the axioms which the symbol introduces, are next\nto be considered.\nLet us take the Proposition, \u201cThe stars are the suns and the planets,\u201d and\nlet us represent stars by x, suns by y, and planets by z; we have then\nx = y + z. (7)\nNow if it be true that the stars are the suns and the planets, it will follow that\nthe stars, except the planets, are suns. This would give the equation\nx \u2212 z = y, (8)\nwhich must therefore be a deduction from (7). Thus a term z has been removed\nfrom one side of an equation to the other by changing its sign. This is in\naccordance with the algebraic rule of transposition.\nBut instead of dwelling upon particular cases, we may at once affirm the\ngeneral axioms:\u2014\n1st. If equal things are added to equal things, the wholes are equal.\n2nd. If equal things are taken from equal things, the remainders are equal.\nAnd it hence appears that we may add or subtract equations, and employ\nthe rule of transposition above given just as in common algebra.\nAgain: If two classes of things, x and y, be identical, that is, if all the\nmembers of the one are members of the other, then those members of the one\nclass which possess a given property z will be identical with those members of\nthe other which possess the same property z. Hence if we have the equation\nx = y;\nthen whatever class or property z may represent, we have also\nzx = zy.\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 26\nThis is formally the same as the algebraic law:\u2014If both members of an equation\nare multiplied by the same quantity, the products are equal.\nIn like manner it may be shown that if the corresponding members of two\nequations are multiplied together, the resulting equation is true.\n14. Here, however, the analogy of the present system with that of algebra,\nas commonly stated, appears to stop. Suppose it true that those members of a\nclass x which possess a certain property z are identical with those members of a\nclass y which possess the same property z, it does not follow that the members\nof the class x universally are identical with the members of the class y. Hence\nit cannot be inferred from the equation\nzx = zy,\nthat the equation\nx = y\nis also true. In other words, the axiom of algebraists, that both sides of an\nequation may be divided by the same quantity, has no formal equivalent here.\nI say no formal equivalent, because, in accordance with the general spirit of\nthese inquiries, it is not even sought to determine whether the mental operation\nwhich is represented by removing a logical symbol, z, from a combination zx,\nis in itself analogous with the operation of division in Arithmetic. That mental\noperation is indeed identical with what is commonly termed Abstraction, and it\nwill hereafter appear that its laws are dependent upon the laws already deduced\nin this chapter. What has now been shown is, that there does not exist among\nthose laws anything analogous in form with a commonly received axiom of\nAlgebra.\nBut a little consideration will show that even in common algebra that\naxiom does not possess the generality of those other axioms which have been\nconsidered. The deduction of the equation x = y from the equation zx = zy is\nonly valid when it is known that z is not equal to 0. If then the value z = 0\nis supposed to be admissible in the algebraic system, the axiom above stated\nceases to be applicable, and the analogy before exemplified remains at least\nunbroken.\n15. However, it is not with the symbols of quantity generally that it is of\nany importance, except as a matter of speculation, to trace such affinities. We\nhave seen (II. 9) that the symbols of Logic are subject to the special law,\nx2 = x.\nNow of the symbols of Number there are but two, viz. 0 and 1, which are\nsubject to the same formal law. We know that 02 = 0, and that 12 = 1; and\nthe equation x2 = x, considered as algebraic, has no other roots than 0 and 1.\nHence, instead of determining the measure of formal agreement of the symbols\nof Logic with those of Number generally, it is more immediately suggested to\nus to compare them with symbols of quantity admitting only of the values 0\nand 1. Let us conceive, then, of an Algebra in which the symbols x, y, z, etc.\nCHAPTER II. SIGNS AND THEIR LAWS 27\nadmit indifferently of the values 0 and 1, and of these values alone. The laws,\nthe axioms, and the processes, of such an Algebra will be identical in their\nwhole extent with the laws, the axioms, and the processes of an Algebra of\nLogic. Difference of interpretation will alone divide them. Upon this principle\nthe method of the following work is established.\n16. It now remains to show that those constituent parts of ordinary language\nwhich have not been considered in the previous sections of this chapter are either\nresolvable into the same elements as those which have been considered, or are\nsubsidiary to those elements by contributing to their more precise definition.\nThe substantive, the adjective, and the verb, together with the particles\nand, except, we have already considered. The pronoun may be regarded as a\nparticular form of the substantive or the adjective. The adverb modifies the\nmeaning of the verb, but does not affect its nature. Prepositions contribute\nto the expression of circumstance or relation, and thus tend to give precision\nand detail to the meaning of the literal symbols. The conjunctions if, either,\nor, are used chiefly in the expression of relation among propositions, and it\nwill hereafter be shown that the same relations can be completely expressed by\nelementary symbols analogous in interpretation, and identical in form and law\nwith the symbols whose use and meaning have been explained in this Chapter.\nAs to any remaining elements of speech, it will, upon examination, be found that\nthey are used either to give a more definite significance to the terms of discourse,\nand thus enter into the interpretation of the literal symbols already considered,\nor to express some emotion or state of feeling accompanying the utterance of a\nproposition, and thus do not belong to the province of the understanding, with\nwhich alone our present concern lies. Experience of its use will testify to the\nsufficiency of the classification which has been adopted.\nChapter III\nDERIVATION OF THE LAWS OF THE SYMBOLS OF\nLOGIC FROM THE LAWS OF THE OPERATIONS OF\nTHE HUMAN MIND.\n1. The object of science, properly so called, is the knowledge of laws and\nrelations. To be able to distinguish what is essential to this end, from what\nis only accidentally associated with it, is one of the most important conditions\nof scientific progress. I say, to distinguish between these elements, because a\nconsistent devotion to science does not require that the attention should be\naltogether withdrawn from other speculations, often of a metaphysical nature,\nwith which it is not unfrequently connected. Such questions, for instance, as\nthe existence of a sustaining ground of ph\u00e6nomena, the reality of cause, the\npropriety of forms of speech implying that the successive states of things are\nconnected by operations, and others of a like nature, may possess a deep interest\nand significance in relation to science, without being essentially scientific. It is\nindeed scarcely possible to express the conclusions of natural science without\nborrowing the language of these conceptions. Nor is there necessarily any\npractical inconvenience arising from this source. They who believe, and they\nwho refuse to believe, that there is more in the relation of cause and effect than\nan invariable order of succession, agree in their interpretation of the conclusions\nof physical astronomy. But they only agree because they recognise a common\nelement of scientific truth, which is independent of their particular views of the\nnature of causation.\n2. If this distinction is important in physical science, much more does\nit deserve attention in connexion with the science of the intellectual powers.\nFor the questions which this science presents become, in expression at least,\nalmost necessarily mixed up with modes of thought and language, which betray\na metaphysical origin. The idealist would give to the laws of reasoning one\nform of expression; the sceptic, if true to his principles, another. They who\nregard the ph\u00e6nomena with which we are concerned in this inquiry as the\nmere successive states of the thinking subject devoid of any causal connexion,\nand they who refer them to the operations of an active intelligence, would, if\nconsistent, equally differ in their modes of statement. Like difference would\nalso result from a difference of classification of the mental faculties. Now the\n28\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 29\nprinciple which I would here assert, as affording us the only ground of confidence\nand stability amid so much of seeming and of real diversity, is the following, viz.,\nthat if the laws in question are really deduced from observation, they have a\nreal existence as laws of the human mind, independently of any metaphysical\ntheory which may seem to be involved in the mode of their statement. They\ncontain an element of truth which no ulterior criticism upon the nature, or even\nupon the reality, of the mind\u2019s operations, can essentially affect. Let it even\nbe granted that the mind is but a succession of states of consciousness, a series\nof fleeting impressions uncaused from without or from within, emerging out of\nnothing, and returning into nothing again,\u2014the last refinement of the sceptic\nintellect,\u2014still, as laws of succession, or at least of a past succession, the results\nto which observation had led would remain true. They would require to be\ninterpreted into a language from whose vocabulary all such terms as cause and\neffect, operation and subject, substance and attribute, had been banished; but\nthey would still be valid as scientific truths.\nMoreover, as any statement of the laws of thought, founded upon actual\nobservation, must thus contain scientific elements which are independent of\nmetaphysical theories of the nature of the mind, the practical application of\nsuch elements to the construction of a system or method of reasoning must\nalso be independent of metaphysical distinctions. For it is upon the scientific\nelements involved in the statement of the laws, that any practical application\nwill rest, just as the practical conclusions of physical astronomy are independent\nof any theory of the cause of gravitation, but rest only on the knowledge of\nits ph\u00e6nomenal effects. And, therefore, as respects both the determination of\nthe laws of thought, and the practical use of them when discovered, we are,\nfor all really scientific ends, unconcerned with the truth or falsehood of any\nmetaphysical speculations whatever.\n3. The course which it appears to me to be expedient, under these\ncircumstances, to adopt, is to avail myself as far as possible of the language of\ncommon discourse, without regard to any theory of the nature and powers of\nthe mind which it may be thought to embody. For instance, it is agreeable to\ncommon usage to say that we converse with each other by the communication\nof ideas, or conceptions, such communication being the office of words; and that\nwith reference to any particular ideas or conceptions presented to it, the mind\npossesses certain powers or faculties by which the mental regard maybe fixed\nupon some ideas, to the exclusion of others, or by which the given conceptions\nor ideas may, in various ways, be combined together. To those faculties or\npowers different names, as Attention, Simple Apprehension, Conception or\nImagination, Abstraction, &c., have been given,\u2014names which have not only\nfurnished the titles of distinct divisions of the philosophy of the human mind,\nbut passed into the common language of men. Whenever, then, occasion shall\noccur to use these terms, I shall do so without implying thereby that I accept\nthe theory that the mind possesses such and such powers and faculties as\ndistinct elements of its activity. Nor is it indeed necessary to inquire whether\nsuch powers of the understanding have a distinct existence or not. We may\nmerge these different titles under the one generic name of Operations of the\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 30\nhuman mind, define these operations so far as is necessary for the purposes of\nthis work, and then seek to express their ultimate laws. Such will be the general\norder of the course which I shall pursue, though reference will occasionally be\nmade to the names which common agreement has assigned to the particular\nstates or operations of the mind which may fall under our notice.\nIt will be most convenient to distribute the more definite results of the\nfollowing investigation into distinct Propositions.\nProposition I.\n4. To deduce the laws of the symbols of Logic from a consideration of those\noperations of the mind which are implied in the strict use of language as an\ninstrument of reasoning.\nIn every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts,\nor of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or\nexpressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The\nmost unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood\nin the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-\nextensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves\nto a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without\nexpressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances\nand conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of\nlife, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be\nthe extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found,\nthat field may properly be termed the universe of discourse.\n5. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the\nultimate subject of the discourse. The office of any name or descriptive term\nemployed under the limitations supposed is not to raise in the mind the\nconception of all the beings or objects to which that name or description\nis applicable, but only of those which exist within the supposed universe of\ndiscourse. If that universe of discourse is the actual universe of things, which it\nalways is when our words are taken in their real and literal sense, then by men\nwe mean all men that exist; but if the universe of discourse is limited by any\nantecedent implied understanding, then it is of men under the limitation thus\nintroduced that we speak. It is in both cases the business of the word men to\ndirect a certain operation of the mind, by which, from the proper universe of\ndiscourse, we select or fix upon the individuals signified.\n6. Exactly of the same kind is the mental operation implied by the use of\nan adjective. Let, for instance, the universe of discourse be the actual Universe.\nThen, as the word men directs us to select mentally from that Universe all the\nbeings to which the term \u201cmen\u201d is applicable; so the adjective \u201cgood,\u201d in the\ncombination \u201cgood men,\u201d directs us still further to select mentally from the\nclass of men all those who possess the further quality \u201cgood;\u201d and if another\nadjective were prefixed to the combination \u201cgood men,\u201d it would direct a further\noperation of the same nature, having reference to that further quality which it\nmight be chosen to express.\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 31\nIt is important to notice carefully the real nature of the operation here\ndescribed, for it is conceivable, that it might have been different from what it is.\nWere the adjective simply attributive in its character, it would seem, that when a\nparticular set of beings is designated by men, the prefixing of the adjective good\nwould direct us to attach mentally to all those beings the quality of goodness.\nBut this is not the real office of the adjective. The operation which we really\nperform is one of selection according to a prescribed principle or idea. To what\nfaculties of the mind such an operation would be referred, according to the\nreceived classification of its powers, it is not important to inquire, but I suppose\nthat it would be considered as dependent upon the two faculties of Conception\nor Imagination, and Attention. To the one of these faculties might be referred\nthe formation of the general conception; to the other the fixing of the mental\nregard upon those individuals within the prescribed universe of discourse which\nanswer to the conception. If, however, as seems not improbable, the power\nof Attention is nothing more than the power of continuing the exercise of any\nother faculty of the mind, we might properly regard the whole of the mental\nprocess above described as referrible to the mental faculty of Imagination or\nConception, the first step of the process being the conception of the Universe\nitself, and each succeeding step limiting in a definite manner the conception\nthus formed. Adopting this view, I shall describe each such step, or any definite\ncombination of such steps, as a definite act of conception. And the use of this\nterm I shall extend so as to include in its meaning not only the conception of\nclasses of objects represented by particular names or simple attributes of quality,\nbut also the combination of such conceptions in any manner consistent with the\npowers and limitations of the human mind; indeed, any intellectual operation\nshort of that which is involved in the structure of a sentence or proposition.\nThe general laws to which such operations of the mind are subject are now to\nbe considered.\n7. Now it will be shown that the laws which in the preceding chapter have\nbeen determined `a posteriori from the constitution of language, for the use\nof the literal symbols of Logic, are in reality the laws of that definite mental\noperation which has just been described. We commence our discourse with a\ncertain understanding as to the limits of its subject, i.e. as to the limits of its\nUniverse. Every name, every term of description that we employ, directs him\nwhom we address to the performance of a certain mental operation upon that\nsubject. And thus is thought communicated. But as each name or descriptive\nterm is in this view but the representative of an intellectual operation, that\noperation being also prior in the order of nature, it is clear that the laws of the\nname or symbol must be of a derivative character,\u2014must, in fact, originate in\nthose of the operation which they represent. That the laws of the symbol and\nof the mental process are identical in expression will now be shown.\n8. Let us then suppose that the universe of our discourse is the actual\nuniverse, so that words are to be used in the full extent of their meaning, and\nlet us consider the two mental operations implied by the words \u201cwhite\u201d and\n\u201cmen.\u201d The word \u201cmen\u201d implies the operation of selecting in thought from its\nsubject, the universe, all men; and the resulting conception, men, becomes the\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 32\nsubject of the next operation. The operation implied by the word \u201cwhite\u201d is that\nof selecting from its subject, \u201cmen,\u201d all of that class which are white. The final\nresulting conception is that of \u201cwhite men.\u201d Now it is perfectly apparent that\nif the operations above described had been performed in a converse order, the\nresult would have been the same. Whether we begin by forming the conception\nof \u201cmen,\u201d and then by a second intellectual act limit that conception to \u201cwhite\nmen,\u201d or whether we begin by forming the conception of \u201cwhite objects,\u201d and\nthen limit it to such of that class as are \u201cmen,\u201d is perfectly indifferent so far\nas the result is concerned. It is obvious that the order of the mental processes\nwould be equally indifferent if for the words \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cmen\u201d we substituted\nany other descriptive or appellative terms whatever, provided only that their\nmeaning was fixed and absolute. And thus the indifference of the order of two\nsuccessive acts of the faculty of Conception, the one of which furnishes the\nsubject upon which the other is supposed to operate, is a general condition of\nthe exercise of that faculty. It is a law of the mind, and it is the real origin of\nthat law of the literal symbols of Logic which constitutes its formal expression\n(1) Chap. II.\n9. It is equally clear that the mental operation above described is of such\na nature that its effect is not altered by repetition. Suppose that by a definite\nact of conception the attention has been fixed upon men, and that by another\nexercise of the same faculty we limit it to those of the race who are white. Then\nany further repetition of the latter mental act, by which the attention is limited\nto white objects, does not in any way modify the conception arrived at, viz.,\nthat of white men. This is also an example of a general law of the mind, and it\nhas its formal expression in the law ((2) Chap, II.) of the literal symbols.\n10. Again, it is manifest that from the conceptions of two distinct classes\nof things we can form the conception of that collection of things which the two\nclasses taken together compose; and it is obviously indifferent in what order of\nposition or of priority those classes are presented to the mental view. This is\nanother general law of the mind, and its expression is found in (3) Chap. II.\n11. It is not necessary to pursue this course of inquiry and comparison.\nSufficient illustration has been given to render manifest the two following\npositions, viz.:\nFirst, That the operations of the mind, by which, in the exercise of its\npower of imagination or conception, it combines and modifies the simple ideas\nof things or qualities, not less than those operations of the reason which are\nexercised upon truths and propositions, are subject to general laws.\nSecondly, That those laws are mathematical in their form, and that they are\nactually developed in the essential laws of human language. Wherefore the laws\nof the symbols of Logic are deducible from a consideration of the operations of\nthe mind in reasoning.\n12. The remainder of this chapter will be occupied with questions relating\nto that law of thought whose expression is x2 = x (II. 9), a law which, as has\nbeen implied (II. 15), forms the characteristic distinction of the operations of the\nmind in its ordinary discourse and reasoning, as compared with its operations\nwhen occupied with the general algebra of quantity. An important part of the\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 33\nfollowing inquiry will consist in proving that the symbols 0 and 1 occupy a place,\nand are susceptible of an interpretation, among the symbols of Logic; and it may\nfirst be necessary to show how particular symbols, such as the above, may with\npropriety and advantage be employed in the representation of distinct systems\nof thought.\nThe ground of this propriety cannot consist in any community of interpretation.\nFor in systems of thought so truly distinct as those of Logic and Arithmetic\n(I use the latter term in its widest sense as the science of Number), there is,\nproperly speaking, no community of subject. The one of them is conversant with\nthe very conceptions of things, the other takes account solely of their numerical\nrelations. But inasmuch as the forms and methods of any system of reasoning\ndepend immediately upon the laws to which the symbols are subject, and\nonly mediately, through the above link of connexion, upon their interpretation,\nthere may be both propriety and advantage in employing the same symbols in\ndifferent systems of thought, provided that such interpretations can be assigned\nto them as shall render their formal laws identical, and their use consistent.\nThe ground of that employment will not then be community of interpretation,\nbut the community of the formal laws, to which in their respective systems they\nare subject. Nor must that community of formal laws be established upon any\nother ground than that of a careful observation and comparison of those results\nwhich are seen to flow independently from the interpretations of the systems\nunder consideration.\nThese observations will explain the process of inquiry adopted in the\nfollowing Proposition. The literal symbols of Logic are universally subject\nto the law whose expression is x2 = x. Of the symbols of Number there are two\nonly, 0 and 1, which satisfy this law. But each of these symbols is also subject to\na law peculiar to itself in the system of numerical magnitude, and this suggests\nthe inquiry, what interpretations must be given to the literal symbols of Logic,\nin order that the same peculiar and formal laws may be realized in the logical\nsystem also.\nProposition II\n13. To determine the logical value and significance of the symbols 0 and 1.\nThe symbol 0, as used in Algebra, satisfies the following formal law,\n0 \u00d7 y = 0, or 0y = 0, (1)\nwhatever number y may represent. That this formal law may be obeyed in\nthe system of Logic, we must assign to the symbol 0 such an interpretation\nthat the class represented by 0y may be identical with the class represented\nby 0, whatever the class y may be. A little consideration will show that this\ncondition is satisfied if the symbol 0 represent Nothing. In accordance with a\nprevious definition, we may term Nothing a class. In fact, Nothing and Universe\nare the two limits of class extension, for they are the limits of the possible\ninterpretations of general names, none of which can relate to fewer individuals\nthan are comprised in Nothing, or to more than are comprised in the Universe.\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 34\nNow whatever the class y may be, the individuals which are common to it and to\nthe class \u201cNothing\u201d are identical with those comprised in the class \u201cNothing,\u201d\nfor they are none. And thus by assigning to 0 the interpretation Nothing, the law\n(1) is satisfied; and it is not otherwise satisfied consistently with the perfectly\ngeneral character of the class y.\nSecondly, The symbol 1 satisfies in the system of Number the following law,\nviz.,\n1 \u00d7 y = y, or 1y = y,\nwhatever number y may represent. And this formal equation being assumed as\nequally valid in the system of this work, in which 1 and y represent classes, it\nappears that the symbol 1 must represent such a class that all the individuals\nwhich are found in any proposed class y are also all the individuals 1y that are\ncommon to that class y and the class represented by 1. A little consideration\nwill here show that the class represented by 1 must be \u201cthe Universe,\u201d since this\nis the only class in which are found all the individuals that exist in any class.\nHence the respective interpretations of the symbols 0 and 1 in the system of\nLogic are Nothing and Universe.\n14. As with the idea of any class of objects as \u201cmen,\u201d there is suggested\nto the mind the idea of the contrary class of beings which are not men; and\nas the whole Universe is made up of these two classes together, since of every\nindividual which it comprehends we may affirm either that it is a man, or that\nit is not a man, it becomes important to inquire how such contrary names are\nto be expressed. Such is the object of the following Proposition.\nProposition III.\nIf x represent any class of objects, then will 1 \u2212 x represent the contrary or\nsupplementary class of objects., i.e. the class including all objects which are not\ncomprehended in the class x.\nFor greater distinctness of conception let x represent the class men, and let\nus express, according to the last Proposition, the Universe by 1; now if from the\nconception of the Universe, as consisting of \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cnot-men,\u201d we exclude\nthe conception of \u201cmen,\u201d the resulting conception is that of the contrary class,\n\u201cnot-men.\u201d Hence the class \u201cnot-men\u201d will be represented by 1 \u2212 x. And, in\ngeneral, whatever class of objects is represented by the symbol x, the contrary\nclass will be expressed by 1 \u2212 x.\n15. Although the following Proposition belongs in strictness to a future\nchapter of this work, devoted to the subject of maxims or necessary truths, yet,\non account of the great importance of that law of thought to which it relates,\nit has been thought proper to introduce it here.\nProposition IV.\nThat axiom of metaphysicians which is termed the principle of contradiction,\nand which affirms that it is impossible for any being to possess a quality, and\nat the same time not to possess it, is a consequence of the fundamental law of\nthought, whose expression is x2 = x.\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 35\nLet us write this equation in the form\nx \u2212 x2 = 0,\nwhence we have\nx (1 \u2212 x) = 0; (1)\nboth these transformations being justified by the axiomatic laws of combination\nand transposition (II. 13). Let us, for simplicity of conception, give to the\nsymbol x the particular interpretation of men, then 1 \u2212 x will represent the\nclass: of \u201cnot-men\u201d (Prop. III.) Now the formal product of the expressions of\ntwo classes represents that class of individuals which is common to them both\n(II. 6). Hence x (1 \u2212 x) will represent the class whose members are at once\n\u201cmen,\u201d and \u201cnot men,\u201d and the equation (1) thus express the principle, that\na class whose members are at the same time men and not men does not exist.\nIn other words, that it is impossible for the same individual to be at the same\ntime a man and not a man. Now let the meaning of the symbol x be extended\nfrom the representing of \u201cmen,\u201d to that of any class of beings characterized by\nthe possession of any quality whatever; and the equation (1) will then express\nthat it is impossible for a being to possess a quality and not to possess that\nquality at the same time. But this is identically that \u201cprinciple of contradiction\u201d\nwhich Aristotle has described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy. \u201cIt\nis impossible that the same quality should both belong and not belong to the\nsame thing.. . . This is the most certain of all principles.. . . Wherefore they who\ndemonstrate refer to this as an ultimate opinion. For it is by nature the source\nof all the other axioms.\u201d1\nThe above interpretation has been introduced not on account of its immediate\nvalue in the present system, but as an illustration of a significant fact in the\nphilosophy of the intellectual powers, viz., that what has been commonly\nregarded as the fundamental axiom of metaphysics is but the consequence of\na law of thought, mathematical in its form. I desire to direct attention also\nto the circumstance that the equation (1) in which that fundamental law of\nthought is expressed is an equation of the second degree.2 Without speculating\n1\u03a4\u1f78 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f04\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u1f74 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4 \u1fc0\u03c8 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4 \u1fc0\u03c8 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc. . . \u0391\u1f55\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u1f74\n\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3v\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1ff6\u03bd. . . \u0394\u03b9\u1f78 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f31 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bd\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c7\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u0384 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f00\u03c1\u03be\u1f74 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u1f55\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd.\u2014Metaphysica, III, 3.\n2Should it here be said that the existence of the equation x2 = x necessitates also the\nexistence of the equation x3 = x, which is of the third degree, and then inquired whether that\nequation does not indicate a process of trichotomy; the answer is, that the equation x3 = x\nis not interpretable in the system of logic. For writing it in either of the forms\nx (1 \u2212 x) (1 + x) = 0, (2)\nx (1 \u2212 x) (\u22121 \u2212 x) = 0, (3)\nwe see that its interpretation, if possible at all, must involve that of the factor 1 + x, or of the\nfactor \u22121 \u2212 x. The former is not interpretable, because we cannot conceive of the addition\nof any class x to the universe 1; the latter is not interpretable, because the symbol \u22121 is not\nsubject to the law x(1 \u2212 x) = 0, to which all class symbols are subject. Hence the equation\nx3 = x admits of no interpretation analogous to that of the equation x2 = x. Were the former\nequation, however, true independently of the latter, i.e. were that act of the mind which is\nCHAPTER III. DERIVATION OF THE LAWS 36\nat all in this chapter upon the question, whether that circumstance is necessary\nin its own nature, we may venture to assert that if it had not existed, the\nwhole procedure of the understanding would have been different from what\nit is. Thus it is a consequence of the fact that the fundamental equation of\nthought is of the second degree, that we perform the operation of analysis and\nclassification, by division into pairs of opposites, or, as it is technically said,\nby dichotomy. Now if the equation in question had been of the third degree,\nstill admitting of interpretation as such, the mental division must have been\nthreefold in character, and we must have proceeded by a species of trichotomy,\nthe real nature of which it is impossible for us, with our existing faculties,\nadequately to conceive, but the laws of which we might still investigate as an\nobject of intellectual speculation.\n16. The law of thought expressed by the equation (1) will, for reasons which\nare made apparent by the above discussion, be occasionally referred to as the\n\u201claw of duality.\u201d\ndenoted by the symbol x, such that its second repetition should reproduce the result of a\nsingle operation, but not its first or mere repetition, it is presumable that we should be able\nto interpret one of the forms (1), (2), which under the actual conditions of thought we cannot\ndo. There exist operations, known to the mathematician, the law of which may be adequately\nexpressed by the equation x3 = x. But they are of a nature altogether foreign to the province\nof general reasoning.\nIn saying that it is conceivable that the law of thought might have been different from what\nit is, I mean only that we can frame such an hypothesis, and study its consequences. The\npossibility of doing this involves no such doctrine as that the actual law of human reason is\nthe product either of chance or of arbitrary will.\nChapter IV\nOF THE DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS INTO THE\nTWO CLASSES OF \u201cPRIMARY\u201d AND\n\u201cSECONDARY;\u201d OF THE CHARACTERISTIC\nPROPERTIES OF THOSE CLASSES, AND OF THE\nLAWS OF THE EXPRESSION OF PRIMARY\nPROPOSITIONS.\n1. The laws of those mental operations which are concerned in the processes of\nConception or Imagination having been investigated, and the corresponding laws\nof the symbols by which they are represented explained, we are led to consider\nthe practical application of the results obtained: first, in the expression of the\ncomplex terms of propositions; secondly, in the expression of propositions; and\nlastly, in the construction of a general method of deductive analysis. In the\npresent chapter we shall be chiefly concerned with the first of these objects, as\nan introduction to which it is necessary to establish the following Proposition:\nProposition I.\nAll logical propositions may be considered as belonging to one or the other\nof two great classes, to which the respective names of \u201cPrimary\u201d or \u201cConcrete\nPropositions,\u201d and \u201cSecondary\u201d or \u201cAbstract Propositions,\u201d may be given.\nEvery assertion that we make may be referred to one or the other of the two\nfollowing kinds. Either it expresses a relation among things, or it expresses, or\nis equivalent to the expression of, a relation among propositions. An assertion\nrespecting the properties of things, or the ph\u00e6nomena which they manifest, or\nthe circumstances in which they are placed, is, properly speaking, the assertion\nof a relation among things. To say that \u201csnow is white,\u201d is for the ends of\nlogic equivalent to saying, that \u201csnow is a white thing.\u201d An assertion respecting\nfacts or events, their mutual connexion and dependence, is, for the same ends,\ngenerally equivalent to the assertion, that such and such propositions concerning\nthose events have a certain relation to each other as respects their mutual\ntruth or falsehood. The former class of propositions, relating to things, I call\n\u201cPrimary;\u201d the latter class, relating to propositions, I call \u201cSecondary.\u201d The\n37\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 38\ndistinction is in practice nearly but not quite co-extensive with the common\nlogical distinction of propositions as categorical or hypothetical.\nFor instance, the propositions, \u201cThe sun shines,\u201d \u201cThe earth is warmed,\u201d are\nprimary; the proposition, \u201cIf the sun shines the earth is warmed,\u201d is secondary.\nTo say, \u201cThe sun shines,\u201d is to say, \u201cThe sun is that which shines,\u201d and it\nexpresses a relation between two classes of things, viz., \u201cthe sun\u201d and \u201cthings\nwhich shine.\u201d The secondary proposition, however, given above, expresses a\nrelation of dependence between the two primary propositions, \u201cThe sun shines,\u201d\nand \u201cThe earth is warmed.\u201d I do not hereby affirm that the relation between\nthese propositions is, like that which exists between the facts which they express,\na relation of causality, but only that the relation among the propositions so\nimplies, and is so implied by, the relation among the facts, that it may for the\nends of logic be used as a fit representative of that relation.\n2. If instead of the proposition, \u201cThe sun shines,\u201d we say, \u201cIt is true that\nthe sun shines,\u201d we then speak not directly of things, but of a proposition\nconcerning things, viz., of the proposition, \u201cThe sun shines.\u201d And, therefore,\nthe proposition in which we thus speak is a secondary one. Every primary\nproposition may thus give rise to a secondary proposition, viz., to that secondary\nproposition which asserts its truth, or declares its falsehood.\nIt will usually happen, that the particles if, either, or, will indicate that\na proposition is secondary; but they do not necessarily imply that such is the\ncase. The proposition, \u201cAnimals are either rational or irrational,\u201d is primary. It\ncannot be resolved into \u201cEither animals are rational or animals are irrational,\u201d\nand it does not therefore express a relation of dependence between the two\npropositions connected together in the latter disjunctive sentence. The particles,\neither, or, are in fact no criterion of the nature of propositions, although it\nhappens that they are more frequently found in secondary propositions. Even\nthe conjunction if may be found in primary propositions. \u201cMen are, if wise,\nthen temperate,\u201d is an example of the kind. It cannot be resolved into \u201cIf all\nmen are wise, then all men are temperate.\u201d\n3. As it is not my design to discuss the merits or defects of the ordinary\ndivision of propositions, I shall simply remark here, that the principle upon\nwhich the present classification is founded is clear and definite in its application,\nthat it involves a real and fundamental distinction in propositions, and that it\nis of essential importance to the development of a general method of reasoning.\nNor does the fact that a primary proposition may be put into a form in which\nit becomes secondary at all conflict with the views here maintained. For in the\ncase thus supposed, it is not of the things connected together in the primary\nproposition that any direct account is taken, but only of the proposition itself\nconsidered as true or as false.\n4. In the expression both of primary and of secondary propositions, the\nsame symbols, subject, as it will appear, to the same laws, will be employed\nin this work. The difference between the two cases is a difference not of form\nbut of interpretation. In both cases the actual relation which it is the object\nof the proposition to express will be denoted by the sign =. In the expression\nof primary propositions, the members thus connected will usually represent the\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 39\n\u201cterms\u201d of a proposition, or, as they are more particularly designated, its subject\nand predicate.\nProposition II.\n5. To deduce a general method, founded upon the enumeration of possible\nvarieties, for the expression of any class or collection of things, which may\nconstitute a \u201cterm\u201d of a Primary Proposition.\nFirst, If the class or collection of things to be expressed is defined only\nby names or qualities common to all the individuals of which it consists, its\nexpression will consist of a single term, in which the symbols expressive of those\nnames or qualities will be combined without any connecting sign, as if by the\nalgebraic process of multiplication. Thus, if x represent opaque substances, y\npolished substances, z stones, we shall have,\nxyz = opaque polished stones;\nxy(1 \u2212 z) = opaque polished substances which are not stones;\nx(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = opaque substances which are not polished, and are not\nstones;\nand so on for any other combination. Let it be observed, that each of these\nexpressions satisfies the same law of duality, as the individual symbols which it\ncontains. Thus,\nxyz \u00d7 xyz = xyz;\nxy(1 \u2212 z) \u00d7 xy(1 \u2212 z) = xy(1 \u2212 z);\nand so on. Any such term as the above we shall designate as a \u201cclass term,\u201d\nbecause it expresses a class of things by means of the common properties or\nnames of the individual members of such class.\nSecondly, If we speak of a collection of things, different portions of which are\ndefined by different properties, names, or attributes, the expressions for those\ndifferent portions must be separately formed, and then connected by the sign +.\nBut if the collection of which we desire to speak has been formed by excluding\nfrom some wider collection a defined portion of its members, the sign \u2212 must\nbe prefixed to the symbolical expression of the excluded portion. Respecting\nthe use of these symbols some further observations may be added.\n6. Speaking generally, the symbol + is the equivalent of the conjunctions\n\u201cand,\u201d \u201cor,\u201d and the symbol \u2212, the equivalent of the preposition \u201cexcept.\u201d\nOf the conjunctions \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor,\u201d the former is usually employed when\nthe collection to be described forms the subject, the latter when it forms the\npredicate, of a proposition. \u201cThe scholar and the man of the world desire\nhappiness,\u201d may be taken as an illustration of one of these cases. \u201cThings\npossessing utility are either productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,\u201d may\nexemplify the other. Now whenever an expression involving these particles\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 40\npresents itself in a primary proposition, it becomes very important to know\nwhether the groups or classes separated in thought by them are intended to\nbe quite distinct from each other and mutually exclusive, or not. Does the\nexpression, \u201cScholars and men of the world,\u201d include or exclude those who\nare both? Does the ex-pression, \u201cEither productive of pleasure or preventive of\npain,\u201d include or exclude things which possess both these qualities? I apprehend\nthat in strictness of meaning the conjunctions \u201cand,\u201d \u201cor,\u201d do possess the power\nof separation or exclusion here referred to; that the formula, \u201cAll x\u2019s are either\ny\u2019s or z\u2019s,\u201d rigorously interpreted, means, \u201cAll x\u2019s are either y\u2019s, but not z\u2019s,\u201d\nor, \u201cz\u2019s but not y\u2019s.\u201d But it must at the same time be admitted, that the\n\u201cjus et norma loquendi\u201d seems rather to favour an opposite interpretation.\nThe expression, \u201cEither y\u2019s or z\u2019s,\u201d would generally be understood to include\nthings that are y\u2019s and z\u2019s at the same time, together with things which come\nunder the one, but not the other. Remembering, however, that the symbol +\ndoes possess the separating power which has been the subject of discussion, we\nmust resolve any disjunctive expression which may come before us into elements\nreally separated in thought, and then connect their respective expressions by\nthe symbol +.\nAnd thus, according to the meaning implied, the expression, \u201cThings which\nare either x\u2019s or y\u2019s,\u201d will have two different symbolical equivalents. If we mean,\n\u201cThings which are x\u2019s, but not y\u2019s, or y\u2019s, but not x\u2019s,\u201d the expression will be\nx(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x);\nthe symbol x standing for x\u2019s, y for y\u2019s. If, however, we mean, \u201cThings which\nare either x\u2019s, or, if not x\u2019s, then y\u2019s,\u201d the expression will be\nx + y(1 \u2212 x).\nThis expression supposes the admissibility of things which are both x\u2019s and y\u2019s\nat the same time. It might more fully be expressed in the form\nxy + x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x);\nbut this expression, on addition of the two first terms, only reproduces the\nformer one.\nLet it be observed that the expressions above given satisfy the fundamental\nlaw of duality (III. 16). Thus we have\n{x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x)}2 = x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x),\n{x + (1 \u2212 x)}2 = x + y(1 \u2212 x).\nIt will be seen hereafter, that this is but a particular manifestation of a general\nlaw of expressions representing \u201cclasses or collections of things.\u201d\n7. The results of these investigations may be embodied in the following rule\nof expression.\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 41\nRule.\u2014Express simple names or qualities by the symbols x, y, z, &c., their\ncontraries by 1 \u2212 x, 1 \u2212 y, 1 \u2212 z, &c.; classes of things defined by common names\nor qualities, by connecting the corresponding symbols as in multiplication;\ncollections of things, consisting of portions different from each other, by\nconnecting the expressions of those portions by the sign +. In particular,\nlet the expression, \u201cEither x\u2019s or y\u2019s,\u201d be expressed by x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x), when\nthe classes denoted by x and y are exclusive, by x + y(1 \u2212 x) when they are not\nexclusive. Similarly let the expression, \u201cEither x\u2019s, or y\u2019s, or z\u2019s,\u201d be expressed\nby x(1\u2212y)(1\u2212z)+y(1\u2212x)(1\u2212z)+z(1\u2212x)(1\u2212y), when the classes denoted by x,\ny, and z, are designed to be mutually exclusive, by x + y(1 \u2212 x) + z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y),\nwhen they are not meant to be exclusive, and so on.\n8. On this rule of expression is founded the converse rule of interpretation.\nBoth these will be exemplified with, perhaps, sufficient fulness in the following\ninstances. Omitting for brevity the universal subject \u201cthings,\u201d or \u201cbeings,\u201d let\nus assume\nx = hard, y = elastic, z = metals;\nand we shall have the following results:\n\u201cNon-elastic metals,\u201d will be expressed by z(1 \u2212 y);\n\u201cElastic substances with non-elastic metals,\u201d by y + z(1 \u2212 y);\n\u201cHard substances, except metals,\u201d by x \u2212 z;\n\u201cMetallic substances, except those which are neither hard nor elastic,\u201d by\nz \u2212 z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y), or by z{1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)}, vide (6), Chap. II.\nIn the last example, what we had really to express was \u201cMetals, except not\nhard, not elastic, metals.\u201d Conjunctions used between adjectives are usually\nsuperfluous, and, therefore, must not be expressed symbolically.\nThus, \u201cMetals hard and elastic,\u201d is equivalent to \u201cHard elastic metals,\u201d and\nexpressed by xyz.\nTake next the expression, \u201cHard substances, except those which are metallic\nand non-elastic, and those which are elastic and non-metallic.\u201d Here the\nword those means hard substances, so that the expression really means, Hard\nsubstances except hard substances, metallic, non-elastic, and hard substances\nnon-metallic, elastic; the word except extending to both the classes which follow\nit. The complete expression is\nx \u2212 {xz(1 \u2212 y) + xy(1 \u2212 z)};\nor, x \u2212 xz(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 xy(1 \u2212 z).\n9. The preceding Proposition, with the different illustrations which have\nbeen given of it, is a necessary preliminary to the following one, which will\ncomplete the design of the present chapter.\nProposition III.\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 42\nTo deduce from an examination of their possible varieties a general method\nfor the expression of Primary or Concrete Propositions.\nA primary proposition, in the most general sense, consists of two terms,\nbetween which a relation is asserted to exist. These terms are not necessarily\nsingle-worded names, but may represent any collection of objects, such as\nwe have been engaged in considering in the previous sections. The mode of\nexpressing those terms is, therefore, comprehended in the general precepts\nabove given, and it only remains to discover how the relations between the\nterms are to be expressed. This will evidently depend upon the nature of the\nrelation, and more particularly upon the question whether, in that relation, the\nterms are understood to be universal or particular, i.e. whether we speak of the\nwhole of that collection of objects to which a term refers, or indefinitely of the\nwhole or of a part of it, the usual signification of the prefix, \u201csome.\u201d\nSuppose that we wish to express a relation of identity between the two\nclasses, \u201cFixed Stars\u201d and \u201cSuns,\u201d i.e. to express that \u201cAll fixed stars are\nsuns,\u201d and \u201cAll suns are fixed stars.\u201d Here, if x stand for fixed stars, and y for\nsuns, we shall have\nx = y\nfor the equation required.\nIn the proposition, \u201cAll fixed stars are suns,\u201d the term \u201call fixed stars\u201d would\nbe called the subject, and \u201c suns\u201d the predicate. Suppose that we extend the\nmeaning of the terms subject and predicate in the following manner. By subject\nlet us mean the first term of any affirmative proposition, i. e. the term which\nprecedes the copula is or are; and by predicate let us agree to mean the second\nterm, i.e. the one which follows the copula; and let us admit the assumption\nthat either of these may be universal or particular, so that, in either case, the\nwhole class may be implied, or only a part of it. Then we shall have the following\nRule for cases such as the one in the last example:\u2013\n10. Rule.\u2014When both Subject and Predicate of a Proposition are universal,\nform the separate expressions for them, and connect them by the sign =.\nThis case will usually present itself in the expression of the definitions of\nscience, or of subjects treated after the manner of pure science. Mr. Senior\u2019s\ndefinition of wealth affords a good example of this kind, viz.:\n\u201cWealth consists of things transferable, limited in supply, and either\nproductive of pleasure or preventive of pain.\u201d\nBefore proceeding to express this definition symbolically, it must be remarked\nthat the conjunction and is superfluous. Wealth is really defined by its\npossession of three properties or qualities, not by its composition out of three\nclasses or collections of objects. Omitting then the conjunction and, let us make\nw = wealth.\nt = things transferable.\ns = limited in supply.\np = productive of pleasure.\nr = preventive of pain.\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 43\nNow it is plain from the nature of the subject, that the expression, \u201cEither\nproductive of pleasure or preventive of pain,\u201d in the above definition, is meant to\nbe equivalent to \u201cEither productive of pleasure; or, if not productive of pleasure,\npreventive of pain.\u201d Thus the class of things which the above expression,\ntaken alone, would define, would consist of all things productive of pleasure,\ntogether with all things not productive of pleasure, but preventive of pain, and\nits symbolical expression would be\np + (1 \u2212 p)r.\nIf then we attach to this expression placed in brackets to denote that both\nits terms are referred to, the symbols s and t limiting its application to things\n\u201ctransferable\u201d and \u201climited in supply,\u201d we obtain the following symbolical\nequivalent for the original definition, viz.:\nw = st{p + r(1 \u2212 p)}. (1)\nIf the expression, \u201cEither productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,\u201d were\nintended to point out merely those things which are productive of pleasure\nwithout being preventive of pain, p(1 \u2212 r), or preventive of pain, without being\nproductive of pleasure, r(1 \u2212 p) (exclusion being made of those things which are\nboth productive of pleasure and preventive of pain), the expression in symbols\nof the definition would be\nw = st{p(1 \u2212 r) + r(1 \u2212 p)}. (2)\nAll this agrees with what has before been more generally stated. The reader\nmay be curious to inquire what effect would be produced if we literally translated\nthe expression, \u201cThings productive of pleasure or preventive of pain,\u201d by p + r,\nmaking the symbolical equation of the definition to be\nw = st(p + r). (3)\nThe answer is, that this expression would be equivalent to (2), with the\nadditional implication that the classes of things denoted by stp and str are\nquite distinct, so that of things transferable and limited in supply there exist\nnone in the universe which are at the same time both productive of pleasure and\npreventive of pain. How the full import of any equation may be determined will\nbe explained hereafter. What has been said may show that before attempting to\ntranslate our data into the rigorous language of symbols, it is above all things\nnecessary to ascertain the intended import of the words we are using. But\nthis necessity cannot be regarded as an evil by those who value correctness of\nthought, and regard the right employment of language as both its instrument\nand its safeguard.\n11. Let us consider next the case in which the predicate of the proposition\nis particular, e.g. \u201cAll men are mortal.\u201d\nIn this case it is clear that our meaning is, \u201cAll men are some mortal\nbeings,\u201d and we must seek the expression of the predicate, \u201csome mortal beings.\u201d\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 44\nRepresent then by v, a class indefinite in every respect but this, viz., that some\nof its members are mortal beings, and let x stand for \u201cmortal beings,\u201d then\nwill vx represent \u201csome mortal beings.\u201d Hence if y represent men, the equation\nsought will be\ny = vx.\nFrom such considerations we derive the following Rule, for expressing an\naffirmative universal proposition whose predicate is particular:\nRule.\u2014Express as before the subject and the predicate, attach to the latter\nthe indefinite symbol v, and equate the expressions.\nIt is obvious that v is a symbol of the same kind as x, y, &c., and that it is\nsubject to the general law,\nv2 = v, orv(1 \u2212 v) = 0.\nThus, to express the proposition, \u201cThe planets are either primary or\nsecondary,\u201d we should, according to the rule, proceed thus:\nLet x represent planets (the subject);\ny = primary bodies;\nz = secondary bodies;\nthen, assuming the conjunction \u201cor\u201d to separate absolutely the class of\n\u201cprimary\u201d from that of \u201csecondary\u201d bodies, so far as they enter into our\nconsideration in the proposition given, we find for the equation of the proposition\nx = v {y (1 \u2212 z) + z (1 \u2212 y)} . (4)\nIt may be worth while to notice, that in this case the literal translation of the\npremises into the form\nx = v(y + z) (5)\nwould be exactly equivalent, v being an indefinite class symbol. The form\n(4) is, however, the better, as the expression\ny (1 \u2212 z) + z (1 \u2212 y)\nconsists of terms representing classes quite distinct from each other, and\nsatisfies the fundamental law of duality.\nIf we take the proposition, \u201cThe heavenly bodies are either suns, or planets,\nor comets,\u201d representing these classes of things by w, x, y, z, respectively, its\nexpression, on the supposition that none of the heavenly bodies belong at once\nto two of the divisions above mentioned, will be\nw = v {x (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z) + y (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 z) + z (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y)}\nIf, however, it were meant to be implied that the heavenly bodies were\neither suns, or, if not suns, planets, or, if neither, suns nor planets, fixed stars,\na meaning which does not exclude the supposition of some of them belonging at\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 45\nonce to two or to all three of the divisions of suns, planets, and fixed stars,\u2014the\nexpression required would be\nw = v {x + y (1 \u2212 x) + z (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y)} . (6)\nThe above examples belong to the class of descriptions, not definitions.\nIndeed the predicates of propositions are usually particular. When this is not\nthe case, either the predicate is a singular term, or we employ, instead of the\ncopula \u201cis\u201d or \u201care,\u201d some form of connexion, which implies that the predicate\nis to be taken universally.\n12. Consider next the case of universal negative propositions, e.g. \u201cNo men\nare perfect beings.\u201d\nNow it is manifest that in this case we do not speak of a class termed \u201cno\nmen,\u201d and assert of this class that all its members are \u201cperfect beings.\u201d But\nwe virtually make an assertion about \u201call men\u201d to the effect that they are \u201cnot\nperfect beings.\u201d Thus the true meaning of the proposition is this:\n\u201cAll men (subject) are (copula) not perfect (predicate);\u201d whence, if y\nrepresent \u201cmen,\u201d and x \u201cperfect beings,\u201d we shall have\ny = v (1 \u2212 x) ,\nand similarly in any other case. Thus we have the following Rule:\nRule.\u2014To express any proposition of the form \u201cNo x\u2019s are y\u2019s,\u201d convert it\ninto the form \u201cAll x\u2019s are not y\u2019s,\u201d and then proceed as in the previous case.\n13. Consider, lastly, the case in which the subject of the proposition is\nparticular, e.g. \u201cSome men are not wise.\u201d Here, as has been remarked, the\nnegative not may properly be referred, certainly, at least, for the ends of Logic,\nto the predicate wise; for we do not mean to say that it is not true that \u201cSome\nmen are wise,\u201d but we intend to predicate of \u201csome men\u201d a want of wisdom. The\nrequisite form of the given proposition is, therefore, \u201cSome men are not-wise.\u201d\nPutting, then, y for \u201cmen,\u201d x for \u201cwise,\u201d i. e. \u201cwise beings,\u201d and introducing v\nas the symbol of a class indefinite in all respects but this, that it contains some\nindividuals of the class to whose expression it is prefixed, we have\nvy = v (1 \u2212 x) .\n14. We may comprise all that we have determined in the following general\nRule:\ngeneral rule for the symbolical expression of primary\npropositions.\n1st. If the proposition is affirmative, form the expression of the subject\nand that of the predicate. Should either of them be particular, attach to it the\nindefinite symbol v, and then equate the resulting expressions.\n2ndly. If the proposition is negative, express first its true meaning by\nattaching the negative particle to the predicate, then proceed as above.\nOne or two additional examples may suffice for illustration.\nCHAPTER IV.

In closing this Chapter it may be interesting to compare together\nthe great leading types of propositions symbolically expressed. If we agree\nto represent by X and Y the symbolical expressions of the \u201cterms,\u201d or things\nrelated, those types will be\nX = vY,\nX = Y,\nvX = vY.\nIn the first, the predicate only is particular; in the second, both terms are\nuniversal; in the third, both are particular. Some minor forms are really included\nunder these. Thus, if Y = 0, the second form becomes\nX = 0;\nand if Y = 1 it becomes\nX = 1;\nboth which forms admit of interpretation. It is further to be noticed, that\nthe expressions X and Y , if founded upon a sufficiently careful analysis of the\nCHAPTER IV. DIVISION OF PROPOSITIONS 47\nmeaning of the \u201cterms\u201d of the proposition, will satisfy the fundamental law of\nduality which requires that we have\nX2 = X or X (1 \u2212 X) = 0,\nY 2 = Y or Y (1 \u2212 Y ) = 0.\nChapter V\nOF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF\nSYMBOLICAL REASONING, AND OF THE\nEXPANSION OR DEVELOPMENT OF EXPRESSIONS\nINVOLVING LOGICAL SYMBOLS.\n1. The previous chapters of this work have been devoted to the investigation\nof the fundamental laws of the operations of the mind in reasoning; of their\ndevelopment in the laws of the symbols of Logic; and of the principles of\nexpression, by which that species of propositions called primary may be\nrepresented in the language of symbols. These inquiries have been in the\nstrictest sense preliminary. They form an indispensable introduction to one of\nthe chief objects of this treatise\u2014the construction of a system or method of\nLogic upon the basis of an exact summary of the fundamental laws of thought.\nThere are certain considerations touching the nature of this end, and the means\nof its attainment, to which I deem it necessary here to direct attention.\n2. I would remark in the first place that the generality of a method in Logic\nmust very much depend upon the generality of its elementary processes and laws.\nWe have, for instance, in the previous sections of this work investigated, among\nother things, the laws of that logical process of addition which is symbolized by\nthe sign +. Now those laws have been determined from the study of instances,\nin all of which it has been a necessary condition, that the classes or things added\ntogether in thought should be mutually exclusive. The expression x + y seems\nindeed uninterpretable, unless it be assumed that the things represented by x\nand the things represented by y are entirely separate; that they embrace no\nindividuals in common. And conditions analogous to this have been involved\nin those acts of conception from the study of which the laws of the other\nsymbolical operations have been ascertained. The question then arises, whether\nit is necessary to restrict the application of these symbolical laws and processes\nby the same conditions of interpretability under which the knowledge of them\nwas obtained. If such restriction is necessary, it is manifest that no such thing\nas a general method in Logic is possible. On the other hand, if such restriction\nis unnecessary, in what light are we to contemplate processes which appear to\nbe uninterpretable in that sphere of thought which they are designed to aid?\nThese questions do not belong to the science of Logic alone. They are equally\n48\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 49\npertinent to every developed form of human reasoning which is based upon the\nemployment of a symbolical language.\n3. I would observe in the second place, that this apparent failure of\ncorrespondency between process and interpretation does not manifest itself\nin the ordinary applications of human reason. For no operations are there\nperformed of which the meaning and the application are not seen; and to most\nminds it does not suffice that merely formal reasoning should connect their\npremises and their conclusions; but every step of the connecting train, every\nmediate result which is established in the course of demonstration, must be\nintelligible also. And without doubt, this is both an actual condition and an\nimportant safeguard, in the reasonings and discourses of common life.\nThere are perhaps many who would be disposed to extend the same principle\nto the general use of symbolical language as an instrument of reasoning.\nIt might be argued, that as the laws or axioms which govern the use of\nsymbols are established upon an investigation of those cases only in which\ninterpretation is possible, we have no right to extend their application to\nother cases in which interpretation is impossible or doubtful, even though (as\nshould be admitted) such application is employed in the intermediate steps of\ndemonstration only. Were this objection conclusive, it must be acknowledged\nthat slight advantage would accrue from the use of a symbolical method in\nLogic. Perhaps that advantage would be confined to the mechanical gain of\nemploying short and convenient symbols in the place of more cumbrous ones.\nBut the objection itself is fallacious. Whatever our `a priori anticipations might\nbe, it is an unquestionable fact that the validity of a conclusion arrived at by any\nsymbolical process of reasoning, does not depend upon our ability to interpret\nthe formal results which have presented themselves in the different stages of the\ninvestigation. There exist, in fact, certain general principles relating to the use\nof symbolical methods, which, as pertaining to the particular subject of Logic, I\nshall first state, and I shall then offer some remarks upon the nature and upon\nthe grounds of their claim to acceptance.\n4. The conditions of valid reasoning, by the aid of symbols, are\u2014\n1st, That a fixed interpretation be assigned to the symbols employed in the\nexpression of the data; and that the laws of the combination of those symbols\nbe correctly determined from that interpretation.\n2nd, That the formal processes of solution or demonstration be conducted\nthroughout in obedience to all the laws determined as above, without regard to\nthe question of the interpretability of the particular results obtained.\n3rd, That the final result be interpretable in form, and that it be actually\ninterpreted in accordance with that system of interpretation which has been\nemployed in the expression of the data. Concerning these principles, the\nfollowing observations may be made.\n5. The necessity of a fixed interpretation of the symbols has already been\nsufficiently dwelt upon (II. 3). The necessity that the fixed result should be in\nsuch a form as to admit of that interpretation being applied, is founded on the\nobvious principle, that the use of symbols is a means towards an end, that end\nbeing the knowledge of some intelligible fact or truth. And that this end may\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 50\nbe attained, the final result which expresses the symbolical conclusion must be\nin an interpretable form. It is, however, in connexion with the second of the\nabove general principles or conditions (V. 4), that the greatest difficulty is likely\nto be felt, and upon this point a few additional words are necessary.\nI would then remark, that the principle in question may be considered as\nresting upon a general law of the mind, the knowledge of which is not given to\nus `a priori, i.e. antecedently to experience, but is derived, like the knowledge of\nthe other laws of the mind, from the clear manifestation of the general principle\nin the particular instance. A single example of reasoning, in which symbols are\nemployed in obedience to laws founded upon their interpretation, but without\nany sustained reference to that interpretation, the chain of demonstration\nconducting us through intermediate steps which are not interpretable, to a final\nresult which is interpretable, seems not only to establish the validity of the\nparticular application, but to make known to us the general law manifested\ntherein. No accumulation of instances can properly add weight to such evidence.\nIt may furnish us with clearer conceptions of that common element of truth\nupon which the application of the principle depends, and so prepare the way\nfor its reception. It may, where the immediate force of the evidence is not felt,\nserve as a verification, `a posteriori, of the practical validity of the principle\nin question. But this does not affect the position affirmed, viz., that the\ngeneral principle must be seen in the particular instance,\u2014seen to be general\nin application as well as true in the special example. The employment of the\nuninterpretable symbol \u221a\u22121, in the intermediate processes of trigonometry,\nfurnishes an illustration of what has been said. I apprehend that there is no\nmode of explaining that application which does not covertly assume the very\nprinciple in question. But that principle, though not, as I conceive, warranted\nby formal reasoning based upon other grounds, seems to deserve a place among\nthose axiomatic truths which constitute, in some sense, the foundation of\nthe possibility of general knowledge, and which may properly be regarded as\nexpressions of the mind\u2019s own laws and constitution.\n6. The following is the mode in which the principle above stated will be\napplied in the present work. It has been seen, that any system of propositions\nmay be expressed by equations involving symbols x, y, z, which, whenever\ninterpretation is possible, are subject to laws identical in form with the laws\nof a system of quantitative symbols, susceptible only of the values 0 and 1 (II.\n15). But as the formal processes of reasoning depend only upon the laws of\nthe symbols, and not upon the nature of their interpretation, we are permitted\nto treat the above symbols, x, y, z, as if they were quantitative symbols of\nthe kind above described. We may in fact lay aside the logical interpretation\nof the symbols in the given equation; convert them into quantitative symbols,\nsusceptible only of the values 0 and 1; perform upon them as such all the requisite\nprocesses of solution; and finally restore to them their logical interpretation.\nAnd this is the mode of procedure which will actually be adopted, though\nit will be deemed unnecessary to restate in every instance the nature of the\ntransformation employed. The processes to which the symbols x, y, z, regarded\nas quantitative and of the species above described, are subject, are not limited\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 51\nby those conditions of thought to which they would, if performed upon purely\nlogical symbols, be subject, and a freedom of operation is given to us in the use\nof them, without which, the inquiry after a general method in Logic would be\na hopeless quest.\nNow the above system of processes would conduct us to no intelligible result,\nunless the final equations resulting therefrom were in a form which should render\ntheir interpretation, after restoring to the symbols their logical significance,\npossible. There exists, however, a general method of reducing equations to such\na form, and the remainder of this chapter will be devoted to its consideration.\nI shall say little concerning the way in which the method renders interpretation\npossible,\u2014this point being reserved for the next chapter,\u2014but shall chiefly\nconfine myself here to the mere process employed, which may be characterized\nas a process of \u201cdevelopment.\u201d As introductory to the nature of this process, it\nmay be proper first to make a few observations.\n7. Suppose that we are considering any class of things with reference to this\nquestion, viz., the relation in which its members stand as to the possession or\nthe want of a certain property x. As every individual in the proposed class either\npossesses or does not possess the property in question, we may divide the class\ninto two portions, the former consisting of those individuals which possess, the\nlatter of those which do not possess, the property. This possibility of dividing\nin thought the whole class into two constituent portions, is antecedent to all\nknowledge of the constitution of the class derived from any other source; of\nwhich knowledge the effect can only be to inform us, more or less precisely, to\nwhat further conditions the portions of the class which possess and which do\nnot possess the given property are subject. Suppose, then, such knowledge is\nto the following effect, viz., that the members of that portion which possess the\nproperty x, possess also a certain property u, and that these conditions united\nare a sufficient definition of them. We may then represent that portion of the\noriginal class by the expression ux (II. 6). If, further, we obtain information\nthat the members of the original class which do not possess the property x, are\nsubject to a condition v, and are thus defined, it is clear, that those members\nwill be represented by the expression v (1 \u2212 x). Hence the class in its totality\nwill be represented by\nux + v (1 \u2212 x) ;\nwhich may be considered as a general developed form for the expression of any\nclass of objects considered with reference to the possession or the want of a\ngiven property x.\nThe general form thus established upon purely logical grounds may also be\ndeduced from distinct considerations of formal law, applicable to the symbols\nx, y, z, equally in their logical and in their quantitative interpretation already\nreferred to (V. 6).\n8. Definition.\u2014Any algebraic expression involving a symbol x is termed a\nfunction of x, and may be represented under the abbreviated general form f (x).\nAny expression involving two symbols, x and y, is similarly termed a function\nof x and y, and may be represented under the general form f (x, y), and so on\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 52\nfor any other case.\nThus the form f (x) would indifferently represent any of the following\nfunctions, viz., x, 1 \u2212 x, 1+x\n1\u2212x , &c.; and f (x, y) would equally represent any of\nthe forms x + y, x \u2212 2y, x+y\nx\u22122y , &c.\nOn the same principles of notation, if in any function f (x) we change x into\n1, the result will be expressed by the form f (1); if in the same function we\nchange x into 0, the result will be expressed by the form f (0). Thus, if f (x)\nrepresent the function a+x\na\u22122x , f (1) will represent a+1\na\u22122 , and f (0) will represent\na\na .\n9. Definition.\u2014Any function f (x), in which x is a logical symbol, or a\nsymbol of quantity susceptible only of the values 0 and 1, is said to be developed,\nwhen it is reduced to the form ax + b (1 \u2212 x), a and b being so determined as\nto make the result equivalent to the function from which it was derived.\nThis definition assumes, that it is possible to represent any function f (x) in\nthe form supposed. The assumption is vindicated in the following Proposition.\nProposition I.\n10. To develop any function f (x) in which x is a logical symbol.\nBy the principle which has been asserted in this chapter, it is lawful to treat\nx as a quantitative symbol, susceptible only of the values 0 and 1.\nAssume then,\nf (x) = ax + b (1 \u2212 x) ,\nand making x = 1, we have\nf (1) = a.\nAgain, in the same equation making x = 0, we have\nf (0) = b.\nHence the values of a and b are determined, and substituting them in the first\nequation, we have\nf (x) = f (1) x + f (0) (1 \u2212 x) ; (1)\nas the development sought.1 The second member of the equation adequately\nrepresents the function f (x), whatever the form of that function may be. For\n1To some it may be interesting to remark, that the development of f (x) obtained in this\nchapter, strictly holds, in the logical system, the place of the expansion of f (x) in ascending\npowers of x in the system of ordinary algebra. Thus it may be obtained by introducing into\nthe expression of Taylor\u2019s well-known theorem, viz.:\nf (x) = f (0) + f \u2032 (0) x + f \u2032\u2032 (0) x2\n1 \u00b7 2 + f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (0) x3\n1 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 3 , &c. (1)\nthe condition x(1 \u2212 x) = 0, whence we find x2 = x, x3 = x, &c., and\nf (x) = f (0) +\n\u001a\nf \u2032 (0) + f \u2032\u2032 (0)\n1 \u00b7 2 + f \u2032\u2032\u2032 (0)\n1 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 3 + &c.\n\u001b\nx. (2)\nBut making in (1), x = 1, we get\nf (1) = f (0) + f \u2032(0) + f \u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 + f \u2032\u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 3 + &c.\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 53\nx regarded as a quantitative symbol admits only of the values 0 and 1, and for\neach of these values the development\nf (1) x + f (0) (1 \u2212 x) ,\nassumes the same value as the function f (x).\nAs an illustration, let it be required to develop the function 1+x\n1+2x . Here,\nwhen x = 1, we find f (1) = 2\n3 , and when x = 0, we find f (0) = 1\n1 , or 1. Hence\nthe expression required is\n1 + x\n1 + 2x = 2\n3 x + 1 \u2212 x ;\nand this equation is satisfied for each of the values of which the symbol x is\nsusceptible.\nProposition II.\nTo expand or develop a function involving any number of logical symbols.\nLet us begin with the case in which there are two symbols, x and y, and let\nus represent the function to be developed by f (x, y).\nFirst, considering f (x, y) as a function of x alone, and expanding it by the\ngeneral theorem (1), we have\nf (x, y) = f (1, y) x + f (0, y) (1 \u2212 x) ; (2)\nwherein f (1, y) represents what the proposed function becomes, when in it\nfor x; we write 1, and f (0, y) what the said function becomes, when in it for x\nwe write 0.\nNow, taking the coefficient f (1, y), and regarding it as a function of y, and\nexpanding it accordingly, we have\nf (1, y) = f (1, 1) y + f (1, 0) (1 \u2212 y) , (3)\nwherein f (1, 1) represents what f (1, y) becomes when y is made equal to 1, and\nf (1, 0) what f (1, y) becomes when y is made equal to 0.\nIn like manner, the coefficient f (0, y) gives by expansion,\nf (0, y) = f (0, 1) y + f (0, 0) (1 \u2212 y) . (4)\nwhence\nf \u2032(0) + f \u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 + &c. = f (1) \u2212 f (0),\nand (2) becomes, on substitution,\nf (x) = f (0) + {f (1) \u2212 f (0)}x,\n= f (1)x + f (0)(1 \u2212 x),\nthe form in question. This demonstration in supposing f (x) to be developable in a series of\nascending powers of x is less general than the one in the text.\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 54\nSubstitute in (2) for f (1, y), f (0, y), their values given in (3) and (4), and we\nhave\nf (x, y) = f (1, 1) xy + f (1, 0) x (1 \u2212 y) + f (0, 1) (1 \u2212 x) y (5)\n+f (0, 0) (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) , (6)\nfor the expansion required. Here f (1, 1) represents what f (x, y) becomes when\nwe make therein x = 1, y = 1; f (1, 0) represents what f (x, y) becomes when\nwe make therein x = 1, y = 0, and so on for the rest.\nThus, if f (x, y) represent the function 1\u2212x\n1\u2212y , we find\nf (1, 1) = 0\n0 , f (1, 0) = 0\n1 , f (0, 1) = 1\n0 , f (0, 0) = 1\nwhence the expansion of the given function is\n0\n0 xy + 0x (1 \u2212 y) + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 x) y + (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) .\nIt will in the next chapter be seen that the forms 0\n0 and 1\n0 , the former of which\nis known to mathematicians as the symbol of indeterminate quantity, admit, in\nsuch expressions as the above, of a very important logical interpretation.\nSuppose, in the next place, that we have three symbols in the function\nto be expanded, which we may represent under the general form f (x, y, z).\nProceeding as before, we get\nf (x, y, z) = f (1, 1, 1) xyz + f (1, 1, 0) xy (1 \u2212 z) + f (1, 0, 1) x (1 \u2212 y) z\n+ f (1, 0, 0) x (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z) + f (0, 1, 1) (1 \u2212 x) yz\n+ f (0, 1, 0) (1 \u2212 x) y (1 \u2212 z) + f (0, 0, 1) (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) z\n+ f (0, 0, 0) (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z)\nin which f (1, 1, 1) represents what the function f (x, y, z) becomes when we\nmake therein x = 1, y = 1, z = 1, and so on for the rest.\n11. It is now easy to see the general law which determines the expansion\nof any proposed function, and to reduce the method of effecting the expansion\nto a rule. But before proceeding to the expression of such a rule, it will be\nconvenient to premise the following observations:\u2014\nEach form of expansion that we have obtained consists of certain terms,\ninto which the symbols x, y, &c. enter, multiplied by coefficients, into which\nthose symbols do not enter. Thus the expansion of f (x) consists of two terms,\nx and 1 \u2212 x, multiplied by the coefficients f (1) and f (0) respectively. And\nthe expansion of f (x, y) consists of the four terms xy, x (1 \u2212 y), (1 \u2212 x) y, and\n(1 \u2212 x), (1 \u2212 y), multiplied by the coefficients f (1, 1), f (1, 0), f (0, 1), f (0, 0),\nrespectively. The terms x, 1 \u2212 x, in the former case, and the terms xy, x (1 \u2212 y),\n&c., in the latter, we shall call the constituents of the expansion. It is evident\nthat they are in form independent of the form of the function to be expanded.\nOf the constituent xy, x and y are termed the factors.\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 55\nThe general rule of development will therefore consist of two parts, the first\nof which will relate to the formation of the constituents of the expansion, the\nsecond to the determination of their respective coefficients. It is as follows:\n1st. To expand any function of the symbols x, y, z.\u2014Form a series of\nconstituents in the following manner: Let the first constituent be the product\nof the symbols; change in this product any symbol z into 1 \u2212 z, for the second\nconstituent. Then in both these change any other symbol y into 1 \u2212 y, for\ntwo more constituents. Then in the four constituents thus obtained change any\nother symbol x into 1 \u2212 x, for four new constituents, and so on until the number\nof possible changes is exhausted.\n2ndly. To find the coefficient of any constituent.\u2014If that constituent involves\nx as a factor, change in the original function x into 1; but if it involves 1 \u2212 x\nas a factor, change in the original function x into 0. Apply the same rule with\nreference to the symbols y, z, &c.: the final calculated value of the function\nthus transformed will be the coefficient sought.\nThe sum of the constituents, multiplied each by its respective coefficient,\nwill be the expansion required.\n12. It is worthy of observation, that a function may be developed with\nreference to symbols which it does not explicitly contain. Thus if, proceeding\naccording to the rule, we seek to develop the function 1 \u2212 x, with reference to\nthe symbols x and y, we have,\nWhen x = 1 and y = 1 the given function = 0.\nx = 1 \u201d y = 0 \u201d \u201d = 0.\nx = 0 \u201d y = 1 \u201d \u201d = 1.\nx = 0 \u201d y = 0 \u201d \u201d = 1.\nWhence the development is\n1 \u2212 x = 0xy + 0x (1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x) y + (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) ;\nand this is a true development. The addition of the terms (1 \u2212 x) y and\n(1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) produces the function 1 \u2212 x.\nThe symbol 1 thus developed according to the rule, with respect to the\nsymbol x, gives\nx + 1 \u2212 x.\nDeveloped with respect to x and y, it gives\nxy + x (1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x) y + (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) .\nSimilarly developed with respect to any set of symbols, it produces a series\nconsisting of all possible constituents of those symbols.\n13. A few additional remarks concerning the nature of the general expansions\nmay with propriety be added. Let us take, for illustration, the general theorem\n(5), which presents the type of development for functions of two logical symbols.\nIn the first place, that theorem is perfectly true and intelligible when x and\ny are quantitative symbols of the species considered in this chapter, whatever\nalgebraic form may be assigned to the function f (x, y), and it may therefore be\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 56\nintelligibly employed in any stage of the process of analysis intermediate between\nthe change of interpretation of the symbols from the logical to the quantitative\nsystem above referred to, and the final restoration of the logical interpretation.\nSecondly. The theorem is perfectly true and intelligible when x and y are\nlogical symbols, provided that the form of the function f (x, y) is such as to\nrepresent a class or collection of things, in which case the second member is\nalways logically interpretable. For instance, if f (x, y) represent the function\n1 \u2212 x + xy, we obtain on applying the theorem\n1 \u2212 x + xy = xy + 0x (1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x) y + (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) ,\n= xy + (1 \u2212 x) y + (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) ,\nand this result is intelligible and true.\nThus we may regard the theorem as true and intelligible for quantitative\nsymbols of the species above described, always; for logical symbols, always when\ninterpretable. Whensoever therefore it is employed in this work it must be\nunderstood that the symbols x, y are quantitative and of the particular species\nreferred to, if the expansion obtained is not interpretable.\nBut though the expansion is not always immediately interpretable, it always\nconducts us at once to results which are interpretable. Thus the expression x\u2212y\ngives on development the form\nx (1 \u2212 y) \u2212 y (1 \u2212 x) ,\nwhich is not generally interpretable. We cannot take, in thought, from the class\nof things which are x\u2019s and not y\u2019s, the class of things which are y\u2019s and not x\u2019s,\nbecause the latter class is not contained in the former. But if the form x \u2212 y\npresented itself as the first member of an equation, of which the second member\nwas 0, we should have on development\nx (1 \u2212 y) \u2212 y (1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nNow it will be shown in the next chapter that the above equation, x and y being\nregarded as quantitative and of the species described, is resolvable at once into\nthe two equations\nx (1 \u2212 y) = 0, y (1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nand these equations are directly interpretable in Logic when logical interpretations\nare assigned to the symbols x and y. And it may be remarked, that though\nfunctions do not necessarily become interpretable upon development, yet\nequations are always reducible by this process to interpretable forms.\n14. The following Proposition establishes some important properties\nof constituents. In its enunciation the symbol t is employed to represent\nindifferently any constituent of an expansion. Thus if the expansion is that\nof a function of two symbols x and y, t represents any of the four forms xy,\nx (1 \u2212 y), (1 \u2212 x) y, and (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y). Where it is necessary to represent the\nconstituents of an expansion by single symbols, and yet to distinguish them\nfrom each other, the distinction will be marked by suffixes. Thus t1 might be\nemployed to represent xy, t2 to represent x (1 \u2212 y), and so on.\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 57\nProposition III.\nAny single constituent t of an expansion satisfies the law of duality whose\nexpression is\nt (1 \u2212 t) = 0.\nThe product of any two distinct constituents of an expansion is equal to 0, and\nthe sum of all the constituents is equal to 1.\n1st. Consider the particular constituent xy. We have\nxy \u00d7 xy = x2y2.\nBut x2 = x, y2 = y, by the fundamental law of class symbols; hence\nxy \u00d7 xy = xy.\nOr representing xy by t,\nt \u00d7 t = t,\nor\nt (1 \u2212 t) = 0.\nSimilarly the constituent x (1 \u2212 y) satisfies the same law. For we have\nx2 = x, (1 \u2212 y)2 = 1 \u2212 y,\n\u2234 {x (1 \u2212 y)}2 = x (1 \u2212 y) , or t (1 \u2212 t) = 0.\nNow every factor of every constituent is either of the form x or of the form 1\u2212x.\nHence the square of each factor is equal to that factor, and therefore the square\nof the product of the factors, i.e. of the constituent, is equal to the constituent;\nwherefore t representing any constituent, we have\nt2 = t, or t (1 \u2212 t) = 0.\n2ndly. The product of any two constituents is 0. This is evident from the\ngeneral law of the symbols expressed by the equation x (1 \u2212 x) = 0; for whatever\nconstituents in the same expansion we take, there will be at least one factor x\nin the one, to which will correspond a factor 1 \u2212 x in the other.\n3rdly. The sum of all the constituents of an expansion is unity. This is\nevident from addition of the two constituents x and 1 \u2212 x, or of the four\nconstituents, xy, x(1 \u2212 y), (1 \u2212 x)y, (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y). But it is also, and more\ngenerally, proved by expanding 1 in terms of any set of symbols (V. 12). The\nconstituents in this case are formed as usual, and all the coefficients are unity.\n15. With the above Proposition we may connect the following.\nProposition IV.\nCHAPTER V. PRINCIPLES OF SYMBOLIC REASONING 58\nIf V represent the sum of any series of constituents, the separate coefficients\nof which are 1, then is the condition satisfied,\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0\nLet t1, t2 . . . tn be the constituents in question, then\nV = t1 + t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + tn.\nSquaring both sides, and observing that t2\n1 = t1, t1t2, = 0, &c., we have\nV 2 = t1 + t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + tn;\nwhence\nV = V 2.\nTherefore\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nChapter VI\nOF THE GENERAL INTERPRETATION OF LOGICAL\nEQUATIONS, AND THE RESULTING ANALYSIS OF\nPROPOSITIONS. ALSO, OF THE CONDITION OF\nINTERPRETABILITY OF LOGICAL FUNCTIONS.\n1. It has been observed that the complete expansion of any function by the\ngeneral rule demonstrated in the last chapter, involves two distinct sets of\nelements, viz., the constituents of the expansion, and their coefficients. I propose\nin the present chapter to inquire, first, into the interpretation of constituents,\nand afterwards into the mode in which that interpretation is modified by the\ncoefficients with which they are connected.\nThe terms \u201clogical equation,\u201d \u201clogical function,\u201d &c., will be employed\ngenerally to denote any equation or function involving the symbols x, y, &c.,\nwhich may present itself either in the expression of a system of premises, or\nin the train of symbolical results which intervenes between the premises and\nthe conclusion. If that function or equation is in a form not immediately\ninterpretable in Logic, the symbols x, y, &c., must be regarded as quantitative\nsymbols of the species described in previous chapters (II. 15), (V. 6), as satisfying\nthe law,\nx (1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nBy the problem, then, of the interpretation of any such logical function or\nequation, is meant the reduction of it to a form in which, when logical values are\nassigned to the symbols x, y, &c., it shall become interpretable, together with\nthe resulting interpretation. These conventional definitions are in accordance\nwith the general principles for the conducting of the method of this treatise,\nlaid down in the previous chapter.\nProposition I.\n2. The constituents of the expansion of any function of the logical symbols\nx, y, &c., are interpretable, and represent the several exclusive divisions of the\nuniverse of discourse, formed by the predication and denial in every possible way\nof the qualities denoted by the symbols x, y, &c.\n59\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 60\nFor greater distinctness of conception, let it be supposed that the function\nexpanded involves two symbols x and y, with reference to which the expansion\nhas been effected. We have then the following constituents, viz.:\nxy, x (1 \u2212 y) , (1 \u2212 x) y, (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) .\nOf these it is evident, that the first xy represents that class of objects which\nat the same time possess both the elementary qualities expressed by x and y,\nand that the second x (1 \u2212 y) represents the class possessing the property x, but\nnot the property y. In like manner the third constituent represents the class of\nobjects which possess the property represented by y, but not that represented\nby x; and the fourth constituent (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y), represents that class of objects,\nthe members of which possess neither of the qualities in question.\nThus the constituents in the case just considered represent all the four classes\nof objects which can be described by affirmation and denial of the properties\nexpressed by x and y. Those classes are distinct from each other. No member\nof one is a member of another, for each class possesses some property or quality\ncontrary to a property or quality possessed by any other class. Again, these\nclasses together make up the universe, for there is no object which may not be\ndescribed by the presence or the absence of a proposed quality, and thus each\nindividual thing in the universe may be referred to some one or other of the four\nclasses made by the possible combination of the two given classes x and y, and\ntheir contraries.\nThe remarks which have here been made with reference to the constituents\nof f (x, y) are perfectly general in character. The constituents of any expansion\nrepresent classes\u2014those classes are mutually distinct, through the possession of\ncontrary qualities, and they together make up the universe of discourse.\n3. These properties of constituents have their expression in the theorems\ndemonstrated in the conclusion of the last chapter, and might thence have been\ndeduced. From the fact that every constituent satisfies the fundamental law of\nthe individual symbols, it might have been conjectured that each constituent\nwould represent a class. From the fact that the product of any two constituents\nof an expansion vanishes, it might have been concluded that the classes they\nrepresent are mutually exclusive. Lastly, from the fact that the sum of the\nconstituents of an expansion is unity, it might have been inferred, that the\nclasses which they represent, together make up the universe.\n4. Upon the laws of constituents and the mode of their interpretation above\ndetermined, are founded the analysis and the interpretation of logical equations.\nThat all such equations admit of interpretation by the theorem of development\nhas already been stated. I propose here to investigate the forms of possible\nsolution which thus present themselves in the conclusion of a train of reasoning,\nand to show how those forms arise. Although, properly speaking, they are but\nmanifestations of a single fundamental type or principle of expression, it will\nconduce to clearness of apprehension if the minor varieties which they exhibit\nare presented separately to the mind.\nThe forms, which are three in number, are as follows:\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 61\nform i.\n5. The form we shall first consider arises when any logical equation V = 0\nis developed, and the result, after resolution into its component equations, is\nto be interpreted. The function is supposed to involve the logical symbols x, y,\n&c., in combinations which are not fractional. Fractional combinations indeed\nonly arise in the class of problems which will be considered when we come to\nspeak of the third of the forms of solution above referred to.\nProposition II.\nTo interpret the logical equation V = 0.\nFor simplicity let us suppose that V involves but two symbols, x and y, and\nlet us represent the development of the given equation by\naxy + bx (1 \u2212 y) + c (1 \u2212 x) y + d (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) = 0; (1)\na, b, c, and d being definite numerical constants.\nNow, suppose that any coefficient, as a, does not vanish. Then multiplying\neach side of the equation by the constituent xy, to which that coefficient is\nattached, we have\naxy = 0,\nwhence, as a does not vanish,\nxy = 0,\nand this result is quite independent of the nature of the other coefficients of the\nexpansion. Its interpretation, on assigning to x and y their logical significance,\nis \u201cNo individuals belonging at once to the class represented by x, and the class\nrepresented by y, exist.\u201d\nBut if the coefficient a does vanish, the term axy does not appear in the\ndevelopment (1), and, therefore, the equation xy = 0 cannot thence be deduced.\nIn like manner, if the coefficient b does not vanish, we have\nx (1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nwhich admits of the interpretation, \u201cThere are no individuals which at the same\ntime belong to the class x, and do not belong to the class y.\u201d\nEither of the above interpretations may, however, as will subsequently be\nshown, be exhibited in a different form.\nThe sum of the distinct interpretations thus obtained from the several terms\nof the expansion whose coefficients do not vanish, will constitute the complete\ninterpretation of the equation V = 0. The analysis is essentially independent of\nthe number of logical symbols involved in the function V , and the object of the\nproposition will, therefore, in all instances, be attained by the following Rule: \u2013\nRule.\u2014Develop the function V , and equate to 0 every constituent whose\ncoefficient does not vanish. The interpretation of these results collectively will\nconstitute the interpretation of the given equation.\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 62\n6. Let us take as an example the definition of \u201cclean beasts,\u201d laid down in\nthe Jewish law, viz., \u201cClean beasts are those which both divide the hoof and\nchew the cud,\u201d and let us assume\nx = clean beasts;\ny = beasts dividing the hoof;\nz = beasts chewing the cud;\nThen the given proposition will be represented\nby the equation\nx = yz\nwhich we shall reduce to the form\nx \u2212 yz = 0,\nand seek that form of interpretation to which the present method leads. Fully\ndeveloping the first member, we have\n0xyz + xy (1 \u2212 z) + x (1 \u2212 y) z + x (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z)\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 x) yz + 0 (1 \u2212 x) y (1 \u2212 z) + 0 (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) z + 0 (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z) .\nWhence the terms, whose coefficients do not vanish, give\nxy (1 \u2212 z) = 0, xz (1 \u2212 y) = 0, x (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z) = 0, (1 \u2212 x) yz = 0.\nThese equations express a denial of the existence of certain classes of objects,\nviz.:\n1st. Of beasts which are clean, and divide the hoof, but do not chew the\ncud.\n2nd. Of beasts which are clean, and chew the cud, but do not divide the\nhoof.\n3rd. Of beasts which are clean, and neither divide the hoof nor chew the\ncud.\n4th. Of beasts which divide the hoof, and chew the cud, and are not clean.\nNow all these several denials are really involved in the original proposition.\nAnd conversely, if these denials be granted, the original proposition will follow\nas a necessary consequence. They are, in fact, the separate elements of that\nproposition. Every primary proposition can thus be resolved into a series of\ndenials of the existence of certain defined classes of things, and may, from\nthat system of denials, be itself reconstructed. It might here be asked, how\nit is possible to make an assertive proposition out of a series of denials or\nnegations? From what source is the positive element derived? I answer, that\nthe mind assumes the existence of a universe not `a priori as a fact independent\nof experience, but either `a posteriori as a deduction from experience, or\nhypothetically as a foundation of the possibility of assertive reasoning. Thus\nfrom the Proposition, \u201cThere are no men who are not fallible,\u201d which is a\nnegation or denial of the existence of \u201cinfallible men,\u201d it may be inferred either\nhypothetically, \u201cAll men (if men exist) are fallible,\u201d or absolutely, (experience\nhaving assured us of the existence of the race), \u201cAll men are fallible.\u201d\nThe form in which conclusions are exhibited by the method of this Proposition\nmay be termed the form of \u201cSingle or Conjoint Denial.\u201d\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 63\nform ii.\n7. As the previous form was derived from the development and interpretation\nof an equation whose second member is 0, the present form, which is supplementary\nto it, will be derived from the development and interpretation of an equation\nwhose second member is 1. It is, however, readily suggested by the analysis of\nthe previous Proposition.\nThus in the example last discussed we deduced from the equation\nx \u2212 yz = 0\nthe conjoint denial of the existence of the classes represented by the constituents\nxy (1 \u2212 z) , xz (1 \u2212 y) , x (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z) , (1 \u2212 x) yz,\nwhose coefficients were not equal to 0. It follows hence that the remaining\nconstituents represent classes which make up the universe. Hence we shall have\nxyz + (1 \u2212 x) y (1 \u2212 z) + (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) z + (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z) = 1.\nThis is equivalent to the affirmation that all existing things belong to some one\nor other of the following classes, viz.:\n1st. Clean beasts both dividing the hoof and chewing the cud.\n2nd. Unclean beasts dividing the hoof, but not chewing the cud.\n3rd. Unclean beasts chewing the cud, but not dividing the hoof.\n4th. Things which are neither clean beasts, nor chewers of the cud, nor\ndividers of the hoof.\nThis form of conclusion may be termed the form of \u201cSingle or Disjunctive\nAffirmation,\u201d\u2014single when but one constituent appears in the final equation;\ndisjunctive when, as above, more constituents than one are there found.\nAny equation, V = 0, wherein V satisfies the law of duality, may also be\nmade to yield this form of interpretation by reducing it to the form 1 \u2212 V = 1,\nand developing the first member. The case, however, is really included in the\nnext general form. Both the previous forms are of slight importance compared\nwith the following one.\nform iii.\n8. In the two preceding cases the functions to be developed were equated to\n0 and to 1 respectively. In the present case I shall suppose the corresponding\nfunction equated to any logical symbol w. We are then to endeavour to interpret\nthe equation V = w, V being a function of the logical symbols x, y, z, &c. In\nthe first place, however, I deem it necessary to show how the equation V = w,\nor, as it will usually present itself, w = V , arises.\nLet us resume the definition of \u201cclean beasts,\u201d employed in the previous\nexamples, viz., \u201cClean beasts are those which both divide the hoof and chew\nthe cud,\u201d and suppose it required to determine the relation in which \u201cbeasts\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 64\nchewing the cud\u201d stand to \u201cclean beasts\u201d and \u201cbeasts dividing the hoof.\u201d The\nequation expressing the given proposition is\nx = yz,\nand our object will be accomplished if we can determine z as an interpretable\nfunction of x and y.\nNow treating x, y, z as symbols of quantity subject to a peculiar law, we\nmay deduce from the above equation, by solution,\nz = x\ny .\nBut this equation is not at present in an interpretable form. If we can reduce\nit to such a form it will furnish the relation required.\nOn developing the second member of the above equation, we have\nz = xy + 1\n0 x (1 \u2212 y) + 0 (1 \u2212 x) y + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x) (1 \u2212 y) ,\nand it will be shown hereafter (Prop. 3) that this admits of the following\ninterpretation:\n\u201cBeasts which chew the cud consist of all clean beasts (which also divide\nthe hoof), together with an indefinite remainder (some, none, or all) of unclean\nbeasts which do not divide the hoof.\u201d\n9. Now the above is a particular example of a problem of the utmost\ngenerality in Logic, and which may thus be stated:\u2014\u201cGiven any logical equation\nconnecting the symbols x, y, z, w, required an interpretable expression for the\nrelation of the class represented by w to the classes represented by the other\nsymbols x, y, z, &c.\u201d\nThe solution of this problem consists in all cases in determining, from the\nequation given, the expression of the above symbol w, in terms of the other\nsymbols, and rendering that expression interpretable by development. Now the\nequation given is always of the first degree with respect to each of the symbols\ninvolved. The required expression for w can therefore always be found. In fact,\nif we develop the given equation, whatever its form may be with respect to w,\nwe obtain an equation of the form\nEw + E\u2032 (1 \u2212 w) = 0, (1)\nE and E\u2032 being functions of the remaining symbols. From the above we have\nE\u2032 = (E\u2032 \u2212 E) w.\nTherefore\nw = E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E (2)\nand expanding the second member by the rule of development, it will only\nremain to interpret the result in logic by the next proposition.\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 65\nIf the fraction E\u2032\nE\u2032\u2212E has common factors in its numerator and denominator,\nwe are not permitted to reject them, unless they are mere numerical constants.\nFor the symbols x, y, &c., regarded as quantitative, may admit of such values 0\nand 1 as to cause the common factors to become equal to 0, in which case the\nalgebraic rule of reduction fails. This is the case contemplated in our remarks on\nthe failure of the algebraic axiom of division (II. 14). To express the solution in\nthe form (2), and without attempting to perform any unauthorized reductions,\nto interpret the result by the theorem of development, is a course strictly in\naccordance with the general principles of this treatise.\nIf the relation of the class expressed by 1 \u2212 w to the other classes, x, y, &c.\nis required, we deduce from (1), in like manner as above,\n1 \u2212 w = E\nE \u2212 E\u2032 ,\nto the interpretation of which also the method of the following Proposition is\napplicable:\nProposition III.\n10. To determine the interpretation of any logical equation of the form w =\nV , in which w is a class symbol, and V a function of other class symbols quite\nunlimited in its form.\nLet the second member of the above equation be fully expanded. Each\ncoefficient of the result will belong to some one of the four classes, which, with\ntheir respective interpretations, we proceed to discuss.\n1st. Let the coefficient be 1. As this is the symbol of the universe, and\nas the product of any two class symbols represents those individuals which are\nfound in both classes, any constituent which has unity for its coefficient must\nbe interpreted without limitation, i.e. the whole of the class which it represents\nis implied.\n2nd. Let the coefficient be 0. As in Logic, equally with Arithmetic, this is\nthe symbol of Nothing, no part of the class represented by the constituent to\nwhich it is prefixed must be taken.\n3rd. Let the coefficient be of the form 0\n0 . Now, as in Arithmetic, the symbol\n0\n0 represents an indefinite number, except when otherwise determined by some\nspecial circumstance, analogy would suggest that in the system of this work the\nsame symbol should represent an indefinite class. That this is its true meaning\nwill be made clear from the following example:\nLet us take the Proposition, \u201cMen not mortal do not exist;\u201d represent this\nProposition by symbols; and seek, in obedience to the laws to which those\nsymbols have been proved to be subject, a reverse definition of \u201cmortal beings,\u201d\nin terms of \u201cmen.\u201d\nNow if we represent \u201cmen\u201d by y, and \u201cmortal beings\u201d by x, the Proposition,\n\u201cMen who are not mortals do not exist,\u201d will be expressed by the equation\ny (1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 66\nfrom which we are to seek the value of x. Now the above equation gives\ny \u2212 yx = 0, or yx = y.\nWere this an ordinary algebraic equation, we should, in the next place, divide\nboth sides of it by y. But it has been remarked in Chap. 11. that the\noperation of division cannot be performed with the symbols with which we\nare now engaged. Our resource, then, is to express the operation, and develop\nthe result by the method of the preceding chapter. We have, then, first,\nx = y\ny ,\nand, expanding the second member as directed,\nx = y + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y) .\nThis implies that mortals (x) consist of all men (y), together with such a\nremainder of beings which are not men (1 \u2212 y), as be indicated by the coefficient\n0\n0 . Now let us inquire what remainder of \u201cnot men\u201d is implied by the premiss. It\nmight happen that the remainder included all the beings who are not men, or it\nmight include only some of them, and not others, or it might include none, and\nany one of these assumptions would be in perfect accordance with our premiss.\nIn other words, whether those beings which are not men are all, or some, or\nnone, of them mortal, the truth of the premiss which virtually asserts that all\nmen are mortal, will be equally unaffected, and therefore the expression 0\n0 here\nindicates that all, some, or none of the class to whose expression it is affixed\nmust be taken.\nAlthough the above determination of the significance of the symbol 0\n0 is\nfounded only upon the examination of a particular case, yet the principle\ninvolved in the demonstration is general, and there are no circumstances under\nwhich the symbol can present itself to which the same mode of analysis is\ninapplicable. We may properly term 0\n0 an indefinite class symbol, and may, if\nconvenience should require, replace it by an uncompounded symbol v, subject\nto the fundamental law, v(1 \u2212 v) = 0.\n4th. It may happen that the coefficient of a constituent in an expansion does\nnot belong to any of the previous cases. To ascertain its true interpretation when\nthis happens, it will be necessary to premise the following theorem:\n11. Theorem.\u2014If a function V , intended to represent any class or\ncollection of objects, w, be expanded, and if the numerical coefficient, a, of\nany constituent in its development, do not satisfy the law.\na (1 \u2212 a) = 0,\nthen the constituent in question must be made equal to 0.\nTo prove the theorem generally, let us represent the expansion given, under\nthe form\nw = a1t1 + a2t2 + a3t3 + &c., (1)\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 67\nin which t1, t2, t3, &c. represent the constituents, and a1, a2, a3, &c. the\ncoefficients; let us also suppose that a1 and a2 do not satisfy the law\na1 (1 \u2212 a1) = 0, a2 (1 \u2212 a2) = 0;\nbut that the other coefficients are subject to the law in question, so that we\nhave\na32 = a3, &c.\nNow multiply each side of the equation (1) by itself. The result will be\nw = a12t1 + a22t2 + &c. (2)\nThis is evident from the fact that it must represent the development of the\nequation\nw = V 2,\nbut it may also be proved by actually squaring (1), and observing that we have\nt12 = t1, t22 = t2, t1t2 = 0, &c.\nby the properties of constituents. Now subtracting (2) from (1), we have\na1 \u2212 a12\u0001 t1 + a2 \u2212 a22\u0001 t2 = 0.\nOr,\na1 (1 \u2212 a1) t1 + a2 (1 \u2212 a2) t2 = 0.\nMultiply the last equation by t1; then since t1t2 = 0, we have\na1 (1 \u2212 a1) t1 = 0, whence t2 = 0.\nIn like manner multiplying the same equation by t2, we have\na2 (1 \u2212 a2) t2 = 0, whence t2 = 0.\nThus it may be shown generally that any constituent whose coefficient is\nnot subject to the same fundamental law as the symbols themselves must be\nseparately equated to 0. The usual form under which such coefficients occur\nis 1\n0 . This is the algebraic symbol of infinity. Now the nearer any number\napproaches to infinity (allowing such an expression), the more does it depart\nfrom the condition of satisfying the fundamental law above referred to.\nThe symbol 0\n0 , whose interpretation was previously discussed, does not\nnecessarily disobey the law we are here considering, for it admits of the numerical\nvalues 0 and 1 indifferently. Its actual interpretation, however, as an indefinite\nclass symbol, cannot, I conceive, except upon the ground of analogy, be deduced\nfrom its arithmetical properties, but must be established experimentally.\n12. We may now collect the results to which we have been led, into the\nfollowing summary:\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 68\n1st. The symbol 1, as the coefficient of a term in a development, indicates\nthat the whole of the class which that constituent represents, is to be taken.\n2nd. The coefficient 0 indicates that none of the class are to be taken.\n3rd. The symbol 0\n0 indicates that a perfectly indefinite portion of the class,\ni.e. some, none, or all of its members are to be taken.\n4th. Any other symbol as a coefficient indicates that the constituent to\nwhich it is prefixed must be equated to 0.\nIt follows hence that if the solution of a problem, obtained by development,\nbe of the form\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D,\nthat solution may be resolved into the two following equations, viz.,\nw = A + vC, (3)\nD = O, (4)\nv being an indefinite class symbol. The interpretation of (3) shows what\nelements enter, or may enter, into the composition of w, the class of things\nwhose definition is required; and the interpretation of (4) shows what relations\nexist among the elements of the original problem, in perfect independence of w.\nSuch are the canons of interpretation. It may be added, that they are\nuniversal in their application, and that their use is always unembarrassed by\nexception or failure.\n13. Corollary.\u2013If V be an independently interpretable logical function, it\nwill satisfy the symbolical law, V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nBy an independently interpretable logical function, I mean one which is\ninterpretable, without presupposing any relation among the things represented\nby the symbols which it involves. Thus x(1 \u2212 y) is independently interpretable,\nbut x \u2212 y is not so. The latter function presupposes, as a condition of its\ninterpretation, that the class represented by y is wholly contained in the class\nrepresented by x; the former function does not imply any such requirement.\nNow if V be independently interpretable, and if w represent the collection\nof individuals which it contains, the equation w = V will hold true without\nentailing as a consequence the vanishing of any of the constituents in the\ndevelopment of V ; since such vanishing of constituents would imply relations\namong the classes of things denoted by the symbols in V . Hence the development\nof V will be of the form\na1t1 + a2t2 + &c.\nthe coefficients a1, a2, &c. all satisfying the condition\na1(1 \u2212 a1) = 0, a2(1 \u2212 a2) = 0, &c.\nHence by the reasoning of Prop. 4, Chap. v. the function V will be subject\nto the law\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 69\nThis result, though evident `a priori from the fact that V is supposed to\nrepresent a class or collection of things, is thus seen to follow also from the\nproperties of the constituents of which it is composed. The condition V (1\u2212V ) =\n0 may be termed \u201cthe condition of interpretability of logical functions.\u201d\n14. The general form of solutions, or logical conclusions developed in the\nlast Proposition, may be designated as a \u201cRelation between terms.\u201d I use, as\nbefore, the word \u201cterms\u201d to denote the parts of a proposition, whether simple\nor complex, which are connected by the copula \u201cis\u201d or \u201care.\u201d The classes of\nthings represented by the individual symbols may be called the elements of the\nproposition.\n15. Ex. 1.\u2013Resuming the definition of \u201cclean beasts,\u201d (VI.6), required a\ndescription of \u201cunclean beasts.\u201d\nHere, as before, x standing for \u201c clean beasts,\u201d y for \u201cbeasts dividing the\nhoof,\u201d z for \u201cbeasts chewing the cud,\u201d we have\nx = yz; (5)\nwhence\n1 \u2212 x = 1 \u2212 yz;\nand developing the second member,\n1 \u2212 x = y(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z);\nwhich is interpretable into the following Proposition: Unclean beasts are all\nwhich divide the hoof without chewing the cud, all which chew the cud without\ndividing the hoof, and all which neither divide the hoof nor chew the cud.\nEx. 2.\u2013The same definition being given, required a description of beasts\nwhich do not divide the hoof.\nFrom the equation x = yz we have\ny = x\nz ;\ntherefore,\n1 \u2212 y = z \u2212 x\nz ;\nand developing the second member,\n1 \u2212 y = 0 xz + \u22121\n0 x(1 \u2212 z) + (1 \u2212 x)z + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z).\ns Here, according to the Rule, the term whose coefficients is \u22121\n0 , must be\nseparately equated to 0, whence we have\n1 \u2212 y = (1 \u2212 x)z + v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z),\nx(1 \u2212 z) = 0;\nwhereof the first equation gives by interpretation the Proposition: Beasts which\ndo not divide the hoof consist of all unclean beasts which chew the cud, and an\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 70\nindefinite remainder (some, none, or all) of unclean beasts which do not chew\nthe cud.\nThe second equation gives the Proposition: There are no clean beasts which\ndo not chew the cud. This is one of the independent relations above referred to.\nWe sought the direct relation of \u201cBeasts not dividing the hoof,\u201d to \u201cClean beasts\nand beasts which chew the cud.\u201d It happens, however, that independently of\nany relation to beasts not dividing the hoof, there exists, in virtue of the premiss,\na separate relation between clean beasts and beasts which chew the cud. This\nrelation is also necessarily given by the process.\nEx. 3.\u2013Let us take the following definition, viz.: \u201cResponsible beings are all\nrational beings who are either free to act, or have voluntarily sacrificed their\nfreedom,\u201d and apply to it the preceding analysis.\nLet x stand for responsible beings.\ny \u201d rational beings.\nz \u201d those who are free to act,\nw \u201d those who have voluntarily sacrificed their\nfreedom of action.\nIn the expression of this definition I shall assume, that the two alternatives\nwhich it presents, viz.: \u201cRational beings free to act,\u201d and \u201cRational beings\nwhose freedom of action has been voluntarily sacrificed,\u201d are mutually exclusive,\nso that no individuals are found at once in both these divisions. This will permit\nus to interpret the proposition literally into the language of symbols, as follows:\nx = yz + yw. (6)\nLet us first determine hence the relation of \u201crational beings\u201d to responsible\nbeings, beings free to act, and beings whose freedom of action has been\nvoluntarily abjured. Perhaps this object will be better stated by saying,\nthat we desire to express the relation among the elements of the premiss in such\na form as will enable us to determine how far rationality may be inferred from\nresponsibility, freedom of action, a voluntary sacrifice of freedom, and their\ncontraries.\nFrom (6) we have\ny = x\n(z + w) ,\nand developing the second member, but rejecting terms whose coefficients\nare 0,\ny = 1\n2 xzw + xz(1 \u2212 w) + x(1 \u2212 z)w + 1\n0 x(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w)\n+ 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w),\nwhence, equating to 0 the terms whose coefficients are 1\n2 and 1\n0 , we have\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 71\ny = xz(1 \u2212 w) + xw(1 \u2212 z) + v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w); (7)\nxzw = 0; (8)\nx(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w) = 0; (9)\nwhence by interpretation\u2014\nDirect Conclusion.\u2014Rational beings are all responsible beings who are\neither free to act, not having voluntarily sacrificed their freedom, or not free\nto act, having voluntarily sacrificed their freedom, together with an indefinite\nremainder (some, none, or all) of beings not responsible, not free, and not having\nvoluntarily sacrificed their freedom.\nFirst Independent Relation.\u2014No responsible beings are at the same\ntime free to act, and in the condition of having voluntarily sacrificed their\nfreedom.\nSecond.\u2013No responsible beings are not free to act, and at the same time in\nthe condition of not having sacrificed their freedom.\nThe independent relations above determined may, however, be put in another\nand more convenient form. Thus (8) gives\nxw = 0\nz = 0z + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 z), on development;\nor,\nxw = v(1 \u2212 z); (10)\nand in like manner (9) gives\nx(1 \u2212 w) = 0\n1 \u2212 z = 0\n0 z + 0(1 \u2212 z);\nor,\nx(1 \u2212 w) = vz; (11)\nand (10) and (11) interpreted give the following Propositions:\n1st. Responsible beings who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not\nfree.\n2nd. Responsible beings who have not voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are\nfree.\nThese, however, are merely different forms of the relations before determined.\n16. In examining, these results, the reader must bear in mind, that the sole\nprovince of a method of inference or analysis, is to determine those relations\nwhich are necessitated by the connexion of the terms in the original proposition.\nAccordingly, in estimating the completeness with which this object is effected,\nwe have nothing whatever to do with those other relations which may be\nsuggested to our minds by the meaning of the terms employed, as distinct from\ntheir expressed connexion. Thus it seems obvious to remark, that \u201cThey who\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 72\nhave voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not free,\u201d this being a relation\nimplied in the very meaning of the terms. And hence it might appear, that\nthe first of the two independent relations assigned by the method is on the one\nhand needlessly limited, and on the other hand superfluous. However, if regard\nbe had merely to the connexion of the terms in the original premiss, it will be\nseen that the relation in question is not liable to either of these charges. The\nsolution, as expressed in the direct conclusion and the independent relations,\nconjointly, is perfectly complete, without being in any way superfluous.\nIf we wish to take into account the implicit relation above referred to, viz.,\n\u201cThey who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not free,\u201d we can do so\nby making this a distinct proposition, the proper expression of which would be\nw = v(1 \u2212 z).\nThis equation we should have to employ together with that expressive of the\noriginal premiss. The mode in which such an examination must be conducted\nwill appear when we enter upon the theory of systems of propositions in a future\nchapter. The sole difference of result to which the analysis leads is, that the\nfirst of the independent relations deduced above is superseded.\n17. Ex. 4. \u2013 Assuming the same definition as in Example 2, let it be required\nto obtain a description of irrational persons.\nWe have\n1 \u2212 y = 1 \u2212 x\nz + w\n= z + w \u2212 x\nz + w\n= 1\n2 xzw + 0xz(1 \u2212 w) + 0x(1 \u2212 z)w \u2212 1\n0 x(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w)\n+ (1 \u2212 x)zw + (1 \u2212 x)z(1 \u2212 w) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)w + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w)\n= (1 \u2212 x)zw + (1 \u2212 x)z(1 \u2212 w) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)w + v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w)\n= (1 \u2212 x)z + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)w + v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w),\nwith xzw = 0, x(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w) = 0.\nThe independent relations here given are the same as we before arrived at,\nas they evidently ought to be, since whatever relations prevail independently\nof the existence of a given class of objects y, prevail independently also of the\nexistence of the contrary class 1 \u2212 y.\nThe direct solution afforded by the first equation is:\u2013Irrational persons\nconsist of all irresponsible beings who are either free to act, or have voluntarily\nsacrificed their liberty, and are not free to act; together with an indefinite\nremainder of irresponsible beings who have not sacrificed their liberty, and are\nnot free to act.\n18. The propositions analyzed in this chapter have been of that species\ncalled definitions. I have discussed none of which the second or predicate term\nCHAPTER VI. OF INTERPRETATION 73\nis particular, and of which the general type is Y = vX, Y and X being functions\nof the logical symbols x, y, z, &c., and v an indefinite class symbol. The analysis\nof such propositions is greatly facilitated (though the step is not an essential one)\nby the elimination of the symbol v, and this process depends upon the method\nof the next chapter. I postpone also the consideration of another important\nproblem necessary to complete the theory of single propositions, but of which\nthe analysis really depends upon the method of the reduction of systems of\npropositions to be developed in a future page of this work.\nChapter VII\nON ELIMINATION.\n1. In the examples discussed in the last chapter, all the elements of the original\npremiss re-appeared in the conclusion, only in a different order, and with a\ndifferent connexion. But it more usually happens in common reasoning, and\nespecially when we have more than one premiss, that some of the elements\nare required not to appear in the conclusion. Such elements, or, as they are\ncommonly called, \u201cmiddle terms,\u201d may be considered as introduced into the\noriginal propositions only for the sake of that connexion which they assist to\nestablish among the other elements, which are alone designed to enter into the\nexpression of the conclusion.\n2. Respecting such intermediate elements, or middle terms, some erroneous\nnotions prevail. It is a general opinion, to which, however, the examples\ncontained in the last chapter furnish a contradiction, that inference consists\npeculiarly in the elimination of such terms, and that the elementary type\nof this process is exhibited in the elimination of one middle term from two\npremises, so as to produce a single resulting conclusion into which that term\ndoes not enter. Hence it is commonly held, that syllogism is the basis, or else\nthe common type, of all inference, which may thus, however complex its form\nand structure, be resolved into a series of syllogisms. The propriety of this\nview will be considered in a subsequent chapter. At present I wish to direct\nattention to an important, but hitherto unnoticed, point of difference between\nthe system of Logic, as expressed by symbols, and that of common algebra,\nwith reference to the subject of elimination. In the algebraic system we are able\nto eliminate one symbol from two equations, two symbols from three equations,\nand generally n \u2212 1 symbols from n equations. There thus exists a definite\nconnexion between the number of independent equations given, and the number\nof symbols of quantity which it is possible to eliminate from them. But it is\notherwise with the system of Logic. No fixed connexion there prevails between\nthe number of equations given representing propositions or premises, and the\nnumber of typical symbols of which the elimination can be effected. From a\nsingle equation an indefinite number of such symbols may be eliminated. On the\nother hand, from an indefinite number of equations, a single class symbol only\nmay be eliminated. We may affirm, that in this peculiar system, the problem\n74\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 75\nof elimination is resolvable under all circumstances alike. This is a consequence\nof that remarkable law of duality to which the symbols of Logic are subject. To\nthe equations furnished by the premises given, there is added another equation\nor system of equations drawn from the fundamental laws of thought itself, and\nsupplying the necessary means for the solution of the problem in question. Of\nthe many consequences which flow from the law of duality, this is perhaps the\nmost deserving of attention.\n3. As in Algebra it often happens, that the elimination of symbols from a\ngiven system of equations conducts to a mere identity in the form 0 = 0, no\nindependent relations connecting the symbols which remain; so in the system\nof Logic, a like result, admitting of a similar interpretation, may present itself.\nSuch a circumstance does not detract from the generality of the principle before\nstated. The object of the method upon which we are about to enter is to\neliminate any number of symbols from any number of logical equations, and to\nexhibit in the result the actual relations which remain. Now it may be, that no\nsuch residual relations exist. In such a case the truth of the method is shown\nby its leading us to a merely identical proposition.\n4. The notation adopted in the following Propositions is similar to that of\nthe last chapter. By f (x) is meant any expression involving the logical symbol\nx, with or without other logical symbols. By f (1) is meant what f (x) becomes\nwhen x is therein changed into 1; by f (0) what the same function becomes when\nx is changed into 0.\nProposition I.\n5. If f (x) = 0 be any logical equation involving the class symbol x, with or\nwithout other class symbols, then will the equation\nf (1)f (0) = 0\nbe true, independently of the interpretation of x; and it will be the complete\nresult of the elimination of x from the above equation.\nIn other words, the elimination of x from any given equation, f (x) = 0, will\nbe effected by successively changing in that equation x into 1, and x into 0, and\nmultiplying the two resulting equations together.\nSimilarly the complete result of the elimination of any class symbols, x,\ny, etc.,from any equation of the form V = 0, will be obtained by completely\nexpanding the first member of that equation in constituents of the given symbols,\nand multiplying together all the coefficients of those constituents, and equating\nthe product to 0.\nDeveloping the first member of the equation f (x) = 0, we have (V. 10),\nf (1)x + f (0)(1 \u2212 x) = 0;\nor, [f (1) \u2212 f (0)]x + f (0) = 0. \u2234 x = f (0)\nf (0) \u2212 f (1) ;\nand 1 \u2212 x = \u2212 f (1)\nf (0) \u2212 f (1) .\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 76\nSubstitute these expressions for x and 1 \u2212 x in the fundamental equation\nx(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nand there results\n\u2212 f (0)f (1)\n[f (0) \u2212 f (1)]2 = 0;\nor, f (1)f (0) = 0, (1)\nthe form required.\n6. It is seen in this process, that the elimination is really effected between\nthe given equation f (x) = 0 and the universally true equation x(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nexpressing the fundamental law of logical symbols, qua logical. There exists,\ntherefore, no need of more than one premiss or equation, in order to render\npossible the elimination of a term, the necessary law of thought virtually\nsupplying the other premiss or equation. And though the demonstration of this\nconclusion may be exhibited in other forms, yet the same element furnished by\nthe mind itself will still be virtually present. Thus we might proceed as follows:\nMultiply (1) by x, and we have\nf (1)x = 0, (2)\nand let us seek by the forms of ordinary algebra to eliminate x from this equation\nand (1).\nNow if we have two algebraic equations of the form\nax + b = 0,\na\u2032x + b\u2032 = 0;\nit is well known that the result of the elimination of x is\nab\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032b = 0 (3)\nBut comparing the above pair of equations with (1) and (3) respectively, we\nfind\na = f (1) \u2212 f (0), b = f (0);\na\u2032 = f (1) b\u2032 = 0;\nwhich, substituted in (4), give\nf (1)f (0) = 0,\nas before. In this form of the demonstration, the fundamental equation x(1 \u2212\nx) = 0, makes its appearance in the derivation of (3) from (1).\n7. I shall add yet another form of the demonstration, partaking of a half\nlogical character, and which may set the demonstration of this important\ntheorem in a clearer light.\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 77\nWe have as before\nf (1)x + f (0)(1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nMultiply this equation first by x, and secondly by 1 \u2212 x, we get\nf (1)x = 0 f (0)(1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nFrom these we have by solution and development,\nf (1) = 0\nx = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x), on development,\nf (0) = 0\n1 \u2212 x = 0\n0 x.\nThe direct interpretation of these equations is\u2013\n1st. Whatever individuals are included in the class represented by f (1), are\nnot x\u2019s.\n2nd. Whatever individuals are included in the class represented by f (0), are\nx\u2019s.\nWhence by common logic, there are no individuals at once in the class f (1)\nand in the class f (0), i.e. there are no individuals in the class f (1)f (0). Hence,\nf (1)f (0) = 0. (4)\nOr it would suffice to multiply together the developed equations, whence the\nresult would immediately follow.\n8. The theorem (5) furnishes us with the following Rule :\nTO ELIMINATE ANY SYMBOL FROM A PROPOSED EQUATION.\nRULE.\u2013The terms of the equation having been brought, by transposition if\nnecessary, to the first side, give to the symbol successively the values 1 and 0,\nand multiply the resulting equations together.\nThe first part of the Proposition is now proved.\n9. Consider in the next place the general equation\nf (x, y) = 0;\nthe first member of which represents any function of x, y, and other symbols.\nBy what has been shown, the result of the elimination of y from this equation\nwill be\nf (x, 1)f (x, 0) = 0;\nfor such is the form to which we are conducted by successively changing in the\ngiven equation y into 1, and y into 0, and multiplying the results together.\nAgain, if in the result obtained we change successively x into 1, and x into\n0, and multiply the results together, we have\nf (1, 1)f (1, 0)f (0, 1)f (0, 0) = 0; (5)\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 78\nas the final result of elimination. But the four factors of the first member of this\nequation are the four coefficients of the complete expansion of f (x, y), the first\nmember of the original equation; whence the second part of the Proposition is\nmanifest.\nexamples.\n10. Ex. 1. \u2013 Having given the Proposition, \u201cAll men are mortal,\u201d and its\nsymbolical expression, in the equation,\ny = vx,\nin which y represents \u201cmen,\u201d and x \u201cmortals,\u201d it is required to eliminate the\nindefinite class symbol v, and to interpret the result.\nHere bringing the terms to the first side, we have\ny \u2212 vx = 0.\nWhen v = 1 this becomes\ny \u2212 x = 0;\nand when v = 0 it becomes\ny = 0;\nand these two equations multiplied together, give\ny \u2212 yx = 0,\nor y(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nit being observed that y2 = y.\nThe above equation is the required result of elimination, and its interpretation\nis, Men who are not mortal do not exist, \u2013 an obvious conclusion.\nIf from the equation last obtained we seek a description of beings who are\nnot mortal, we have\nx = y\ny ,\n\u2234 1 \u2212 x = 0\ny .\nWhence, by expansion, 1 \u2212 x = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y), which interpreted gives, They who\nare not mortal are not men. This is an example of what in the common logic is\ncalled conversion by contraposition, or negative conversion. 1\nEx. 2.\u2013Taking the Proposition, \u201cNo men are perfect,\u201d as represented by the\nequation\ny = v(1 \u2212 x),\n1Whately\u2019s Logic, Book II. chap. II. sec. 4.\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 79\nwherein y represents \u201cmen,\u201d and x \u201cperfect beings,\u201d it is required to eliminate\nv, and find from the result a description both of perfect beings and of imperfect\nbeings. We have\ny \u2212 v(1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nWhence, by the rule of elimination,\n{y \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)} \u00d7 y = 0,\nor\ny \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nor\nyx = 0;\nwhich is interpreted by the Proposition, Perfect men do not exist. From the\nabove equation we have\nx = 0\ny = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y) by development;\nwhence, by interpretation, No perfect beings are men. Similarly,\n1 \u2212 x = 1 \u2212 0\ny = y\ny = y + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y),\nwhich, on interpretation, gives, Imperfect beings are all men with an indefinite\nremainder of beings, which are not men.\n11. It will generally be the most convenient course, in the treatment of\npropositions, to eliminate first the indefinite class symbol v, wherever it occurs\nin the corresponding equations. This will only modify their form, without\nimpairing their significance. Let us apply this process to one of the examples of\nChap. IV. For the Proposition, \u201cNo men are placed in exalted stations and free\nfrom envious regards,\u201d we found the expression\ny = v(1 \u2212 xz),\nand for the equivalent Proposition, \u201cMen in exalted stations are not free from\nenvious regards,\u201d the expression\nyx = v(1 \u2212 z);\nand it was observed that these equations, v being an indefinite class symbol,\nwere themselves equivalent. To prove this, it is only necessary to eliminate from\neach the symbol v. The first equation is\ny \u2212 v(1 \u2212 xz) = 0,\nwhence, first making v = 1, and then v = 0, and multiplying the results, we\nhave\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 80\n(y \u2212 1 + xz)y = 0,\nor yxz = 0.\nNow the second of the given equations becomes on transposition\nyx \u2212 v(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 0;\nwhence (x \u2212 1 + z)yx = 0,\nor yxz = 0,\nas before. The reader will easily interpret the result.\n12. Ex. 3.\u2013As a subject for the general method of this chapter, we will\nresume Mr. Senior\u2019s definition of wealth, viz.: \u201cWealth consists of things\ntransferable, limited in supply, and either productive of pleasure or preventive\nof pain.\u201d We shall consider this definition, agreeably to a former remark, as\nincluding all things which possess at once both the qualities expressed in the\nlast part of the definition, upon which assumption we have, as our representative\nequation,\nw = st{pr + p(1 \u2212 r) + r(1 \u2212 p)},\nor w = st{p + r(1 \u2212 p)},\nwherein\nw stands for wealth.\ns \u201d things limited in supply.\nt \u201d things transferable.\np \u201d things productive of pleasure.\nr \u201d things preventive of pain.\nFrom the above equation we can eliminate any symbols that we do not\ndesire to take into account, and express the result by solution and development,\naccording to any proposed arrangement of subject and predicate.\nLet us first consider what the expression for w, wealth, would be if the\nelement r, referring to prevention of pain, were eliminated. Now bringing the\nterms of the equation to the first side, we get\nw \u2212 st(p + r \u2212 rp) = 0.\nMaking r = 1, the first member becomes w\u2212st, and making r = 0 it becomes\nw \u2212 stp; whence we have by the Rule,\n(w \u2212 st)(w \u2212 stp) = 0 (6)\nor\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 81\nw \u2212 wstp \u2212 wst + stp = 0; (7)\nwhence\nw = stp\nst + stp \u2212 1 ;\nthe development of the second member of which equation gives\nw = stp + 0\n0 st(1 \u2212 p). (8)\nWhence we have the conclusion,\u2013Wealth consists of all things limited in\nsupply, transferable, and productive of pleasure, and an indefinite remainder\nof things limited in supply, transferable, and not productive of pleasure. This is\nsufficiently obvious.\nLet it be remarked that it is not necessary to perform the multiplication\nindicated in (7), and reduce that equation to the form (8), in order to determine\nthe expression of w in terms of the other symbols. The process of development\nmay in all cases be made to supersede that of multiplication. Thus if we develop\n(7) in terms of w, we find\n(1 \u2212 sf )(1 \u2212 stp)w + stp(1 \u2212 w) = 0,\nwhence\nw = stp\nstp \u2212 (1 \u2212 st)(1 \u2212 stp) ;\nand this equation developed will give, as before,\nw = stp + 0\n0 st(1 \u2212 p).\n13. Suppose next that we seek a description of things limited in supply,\nas dependent upon their relation to wealth, transferableness, and tendency to\nproduce pleasure, omitting all reference to the prevention of pain.\nFrom equation (8), which is the result of the elimination of r from the original\nequation, we have\nw \u2212 s (wt + wtp \u2212 tp) = 0;\nwhence\ns = w\nwt + wtp \u2212 tp\n= wtp + wt (1 \u2212 p) + 1\n0 w (1 \u2212 t) p + 1\n0 w (1 \u2212 t) (1 \u2212 p)\n+0 (1 \u2212 w) tp + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w) t (1 \u2212 p) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w) (1 \u2212 t) p\n+ 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w) (1 \u2212 t) (1 \u2212 p) .\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 82\nWe will first give the direct interpretation of the above solution, term by term;\nafterwards we shall offer some general remarks which it suggests; and, finally,\nshow how the expression of the conclusion may be somewhat abbreviated.\nFirst, then, the direct interpretation is, Things limited in supply consist of\nAll wealth transferable and productive of pleasure\u2013all wealth transferable, and not\nproductive of pleasure,\u2013an indefinite amount of what is not wealth, but is either\ntransferable, and not productive of pleasure, or intransferable and productive of\npleasure, or neither transferable nor productive of pleasure.\nTo which the terms whose coefficients are 1\n0 permit us to add the following\nindependent relations, viz.:\n1st. Wealth that is intransferable, and productive of pleasure, does not exist.\n2ndly. Wealth that is intransferable, and not productive of pleasure, does not\nexist.\n14. Respecting this solution I suppose the following remarks are likely to be\nmade.\nFirst, it may be said, that in the expression above obtained for \u201cthings\nlimited in supply,\u201d the term \u201cAll wealth transferable,\u201d &c., is in part redundant;\nsince all wealth is (as implied in the original proposition, and directly asserted\nin the independent relations) necessarily transferable.\nI answer, that although in ordinary speech we should not deem it necessary to\nadd to \u201cwealth\u201d the epithet \u201ctransferable,\u201d if another part of our reasoning had\nled us to express the conclusion, that there is no wealth which is not transferable,\nyet it pertains to the perfection of this method that it in all cases fully defines the\nobjects represented by each term of the conclusion, by stating the relation they\nbear to each quality or element of distinction that we have chosen to employ.\nThis is necessary in order to keep the different parts of the solution really distinct\nand independent, and actually prevents redundancy. Suppose that the pair of\nterms we have been considering had not contained the word \u201ctransferable,\u201d\nand had unitedly been \u201cAll wealth,\u201d we could then logically resolve the single\nterm \u201cAll wealth\u201d into the two terms \u201cAll wealth transferable,\u201d and \u201cAll wealth\nintransferable.\u201d But the latter term is shown to disappear by the \u201cindependent\nrelations.\u201d Hence it forms no part of the description required, and is therefore\nredundant. The remaining term agrees with the conclusion actually obtained.\nSolutions in which there cannot, by logical divisions, be produced any\nsuperfluous or redundant terms, may be termed pure solutions. Such are all\nthe solutions obtained by the method of development and elimination above\nexplained. It is proper to notice, that if the common algebraic method of\nelimination were adopted in the cases in which that method is possible in the\npresent system, we should not be able to depend upon the purity of the solutions\nobtained. Its want of generality would not be its only defect.\n15. In the second place, it will be remarked, that the conclusion contains\ntwo terms, the aggregate significance of which would be more conveniently\nexpressed by a single term. Instead of \u201cAll wealth productive of pleasure, and\ntransferable,\u201d and \u201cAll wealth not productive of pleasure, and transferable,\u201d we\nmight simply say, \u201cAll wealth transferable.\u201d This remark is quite just. But it\nmust be noticed that whenever any such simplifications are possible, they are\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 83\nimmediately suggested by the form of the equation we have to interpret; and if\nthat equation be reduced to its simplest form, then the interpretation to which\nit conducts will be in its simplest form also. Thus in the original solution the\nterms wtp and wt(1\u2212p), which have unity for their coefficient, give, on addition,\nwt; the terms w (1 \u2212 t) p and w (1 \u2212 t) (1 \u2212 p), which have 1\n0 for their coefficient\ngive w (1 \u2212 t); and the terms (1 \u2212 w) (1 \u2212 t) p and (1 \u2212 w) (1 \u2212 t) (1 \u2212 p), which\nhave 0\n0 for their coefficient, give (1 \u2212 w) (1 \u2212 t). Whence the complete solution\nis\ns = wt + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w) (1 \u2212 t) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w) t (1 \u2212 p) ,\nwith the independent relation,\nw (1 \u2212 t) = 0, or w = 0\n0 t.\nThe interpretation would now stand thus:\u2013\n1st. Things limited in supply consist of all wealth transferable, with\nan indefinite remainder of what is not wealth and not transferable, and of\ntransferable articles which are not wealth, and are not productive of pleasure.\n2nd. All wealth is transferable.\nThis is the simplest form under which the general conclusion, with its\nattendant condition, can be put.\n16. When it is required to eliminate two or more symbols from a proposed\nequation we can either employ (6) Prop. I., or eliminate them in succession, the\norder of the process being indifferent. From the equation\nw = st (p + r \u2212 pr) ,\nwe have eliminated r, and found the result,\nw \u2212 wst \u2212 wstp + stp = 0.\nSuppose that it had been required to eliminate both r and t, then taking the\nabove as the first step of the process, it remains to eliminate from the last\nequation t. Now when t = 1 the first member of that equation becomes\nw \u2212 ws \u2212 wsp + sp,\nand when t = 0 the same member becomes w. Whence we have\nw (w \u2212 ws \u2212 wsp + sp) = 0,\nor\nw \u2212 ws = 0,\nfor the required result of elimination.\nIf from the last result we determine w, we have\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 84\nw = 0\n1 \u2212 s = 0\n0 s,\nwhence \u201cAll wealth is limited in supply.\u201d As p does not enter into the\nequation, it is evident that the above is true, irrespectively of any relation which\nthe elements of the conclusion bear to the quality \u201cproductive of pleasure.\u201d\nResuming the original equation, let it be required to eliminate s and t. We\nhave\nw = st(p + r \u2212 pr).\nInstead, however, of separately eliminating s and t according to the Rule, it\nwill suffice to treat st as a single symbol, seeing that it satisfies the fundamental\nlaw of the symbols by the equation\nst(1 \u2212 st) = 0.\nPlacing, therefore, the given equation under the form\nw \u2212 st(p + r \u2212 pr) = 0;\nand making st successively equal to 1 and to 0, and taking the product of\nthe results, we have\n(w \u2212 p \u2212 r + pr)w = 0,\nor w \u2212 wp \u2212 wr + wpr = 0,\nfor the result sought.\nAs a particular illustration, let it be required to deduce an expression for\n\u201cthings productive of pleasure\u201d (p), in terms of \u201cwealth\u201d (w), and \u201cthings\npreventive of pain\u201d (r).\nWe have, on solving the equation,\np = w(1 \u2212 r)\nw(1 \u2212 r)\n= 0\n0 wr + w(1 \u2212 r) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w)r + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 r)\n= w(1 \u2212 r) + 0\n0 wr + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w).\nWhence the following conclusion:\u2013Things productive of pleasure are, all\nwealth not preventive of pain, an indefinite amount of wealth that is preventive\nof pain, and an indefinite amount of what is not wealth.\nFrom the same equation we get\n1 \u2212 p = 1 \u2212 w(1 \u2212 r)\nw(1 \u2212 r) = 0\nw(1 \u2212 r) ,\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 85\nwhich developed, gives\nw(1 \u2212 p) = 0\n0 wr + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w)\u00b7r + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w) \u00b7 (1 \u2212 r)\n= 0\n0 wr + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w).\nWhence, Things not productive of pleasure are either wealth, preventive of\npain, or what is not wealth.\nEqually easy would be the discussion of any similar case.\n17. In the last example of elimination, we have eliminated the compound\nsymbol st from the given equation, by treating it as a single symbol. The\nsame method is applicable to any combination of symbols which satisfies the\nfundamental law of individual symbols. Thus the expression p + r \u2212 pr will, on\nbeing multiplied by itself, reproduce itself, so that if we represent p + r \u2212 pr by\na single symbol as y, we shall have the fundamental law obeyed, the equation\ny = y2, or y(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nbeing satisfied. For the rule of elimination for symbols is founded upon the\nsupposition that each individual symbol is subject to that law; and hence the\nelimination of any function or combination of such symbols from an equation,\nmay be effected by a single operation, whenever that law is satisfied by the\nfunction.\nThough the forms of interpretation adopted in this and the previous chapter\nshow, perhaps better than any others, the direct significance of the symbols\n1 and 0\n0 , modes of expression more agreeable to those of common discourse\nmay, with equal truth and propriety, be employed. Thus the equation (9) may\nbe interpreted in the following manner: Wealth is either limited in supply,\ntransferable, and productive of pleasure, or limited in supply, transferable,\nand not productive of pleasure. And reversely, Whatever is limited in supply,\ntransferable, and productive of pleasure, is wealth. Reverse interpretations,\nsimilar to the above, are always furnished when the final development introduces\nterms having unity as a coefficient.\n18. NOTE.\u2013The fundamental equation f (1)f (0) = 0, expressing the result\nof the elimination of the symbol x from any equation f (x) = 0, admits of a\nremarkable interpretation.\nIt is to be remembered, that by the equation f (x) = 0 is implied some\nproposition in which the individuals represented by the class x, suppose \u201cmen,\u201d\nare referred to, together, it may be, with other individuals; and it is our object\nto ascertain whether there is implied in the proposition any relation among\nthe other individuals, independently of those found in the class men. Now\nthe equation f (1) = 0 expresses what the original proposition would become\nif men made up the universe, and the equation f (0) = 0 expresses what that\noriginal proposition would become if men ceased to exist, wherefore the equation\nf (1)f (0) = 0 expresses what in virtue of the original proposition would be\nCHAPTER VII. OF ELIMINATION 86\nequally true on either assumption, i. e. equally true whether \u201cmen\u201d were \u201call\nthings\u201d or \u201cnothing.\u201d Wherefore the theorem expresses that what is equally\ntrue, whether a given class of objects embraces the whole universe or disappears\nfrom existence, is independent of that class altogether, and vice vers\u02c6a. Herein we\nsee another example of the interpretation of formal results, immediately deduced\nfrom the mathematical laws of thought, into general axioms of philosophy.\nChapter VIII\nON THE REDUCTION OF SYSTEMS OF\nPROPOSITIONS.\n1. In the preceding chapters we have determined sufficiently for the most\nessential purposes the theory of single primary propositions, or, to speak more\naccurately, of primary propositions expressed by a single equation. And we\nhave established upon that theory an adequate method. We have shown how\nany element involved in the given system of equations may be eliminated, and\nthe relation which connects the remaining elements deduced in any proposed\nform, whether of denial, of affirmation, or of the more usual relation of subject\nand predicate. It remains that we proceed to the consideration of systems of\npropositions, and institute with respect to them a similar series of investigations.\nWe are to inquire whether it is possible from the equations by which a system\nof propositions is expressed to eliminate, ad libitum, any number of the symbols\ninvolved; to deduce by interpretation of the result the whole of the relations\nimplied among the remaining symbols; and to determine in particular the\nexpression of any single element, or of any interpretable combination of\nelements, in terms of the other elements, so as to present the conclusion in\nany admissible form that may be required. These questions will be answered\nby showing that it is possible to reduce any system of equations, or any of the\nequations involved in a system, to an equivalent single equation, to which the\nmethods of the previous chapters may be immediately applied. It will be seen\nalso, that in this reduction is involved an important extension of the theory\nof single propositions, which in the previous discussion of the subject we were\ncompelled to forego. This circumstance is not peculiar in its nature. There are\nmany special departments of science which cannot be completely surveyed from\nwithin, but require to be studied also from an external point of view, and to be\nregarded in connexion with other and kindred subjects, in order that their full\nproportions be understood.\nThis chapter will exhibit two distinct modes of reducing systems of equations\nto equivalent single equations. The first of these rests upon the employment of\narbitrary constant multipliers. It is a method sufficiently simple in theory, but it\nhas the inconvenience of rendering the subsequent processes of elimination and\ndevelopment, when they occur, somewhat tedious. It was, however, the method\n87\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 88\nof reduction first discovered, and partly on this account, and partly on account\nof its simplicity, it has been thought proper to retain it. The second method\ndoes not require the introduction of arbitrary constants, and is in nearly all\nrespects preferable to the preceding one. It will, therefore, generally be adopted\nin the subsequent investigations of this work.\n2. We proceed to the consideration of the first method.\nProposition I.\nAny system of logical equations may be reduced to a single equivalent\nequation, by multiplying each equation after the first by a distinct arbitrary\nconstant quantity, and adding all the results, including the first equation,\ntogether.\nBy Prop. 2, Chap, VI., the interpretation of any single equation, f (x, y..) = 0\nis obtained by equating to 0 those constituents of the development of the first\nmember, whose coefficients do not vanish. And hence, if there be given two\nequations, f (x, y..) = 0, and F (x, y..) = 0, their united import will be contained\nin the system of results formed by equating to 0 all those constituents which\nthus present themselves in both, or in either, of the given equations developed\naccording to the Rule of Chap. VI. Thus let it be supposed, that we have the\ntwo equations\nxy \u2212 2x = 0, (1)\nx \u2212 y = 0; (2)\nThe development of the first gives\n\u2212xy \u2212 2x(1 \u2212 y) = 0;\nwhence, xy = 0, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (3)\nThe development of the second equation gives\nx(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x) = 0;\nwhence, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0, y(1 \u2212 x) = 0. (4)\nThe constituents whose coefficients do not vanish in both developments are xy,\nx(1 \u2212 y), and (1 \u2212 x)y, and these would together give the system\nxy = 0, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0, (l \u2212 x)y = 0; (5)\nwhich is equivalent to the two systems given by the developments separately,\nseeing that in those systems the equation x(1 \u2212 y) = 0 is repeated. Confining\nourselves to the case of binary systems of equations, it remains then to determine\na single equation, which on development shall yield the same constituents with\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 89\ncoefficients which do not vanish, as the given equations produce. Now if we\nrepresent by\nV1 = 0, V2 = 0,\nthe given equations, V1 and V2 being functions of the logical symbols x, y, z,\n&c.; then the single equation\nV1 + cV2 = 0, (6)\nc being an arbitrary constant quantity, will accomplish the required object. For\nlet At represent any term in the full development V , wherein t is a constituent\nand A its numerical coefficient, and let Bt represent the corresponding term in\nthe full development of V2, then will the corresponding term in the development\nof (6) be\n(A + cB)t.\nThe coefficient of t vanishes if A and B both vanish, but not otherwise. For if\nwe assume that A and B do not both vanish, and at the same time make\nA + cB = 0, (7)\nthe following cases alone can present themselves.\n1st. That A vanishes and B does not vanish. In this case the above equation\nbecomes\ncB = 0,\nand requires that c = 0. But this contradicts the hypothesis that c is an\narbitrary constant.\n2nd. That B vanishes and A does not vanish. This assumption reduces (7)\nto\nA = 0,\nby which the assumption is itself violated.\n3rd. That neither A nor B vanishes. The equation (7) then gives\nc = \u2212A\nB\nwhich is a definite value, and, therefore, conflicts with the hypothesis that c is\narbitrary.\nHence the coefficient A + cB vanishes when A and B both vanish, but not\notherwise. Therefore, the same constituents will appear in the development of\n(6), with coefficients which do not vanish, as in the equations V1 = 0, V2 = 0,\nsingly or together. And the equation V1 + cV2 = 0, will be equivalent to the\nsystem V1 = 0, V2 = 0.\nBy similar reasoning it appears, that the general system of equations\nV1 = 0, V2 = 0, V3 = 0, &c. ;\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 90\nmay be replaced by the single equation\nV1 + cV2 + c\u2032V3 + &c. = 0 ,\nc, c\u2032, &c., being arbitrary constants. The equation thus formed may be treated\nin all respects as the ordinary logical equations of the previous chapters. The\narbitrary constants c1, c2, &c., are not logical symbols. They do not satisfy the\nlaw,\nc1(1 \u2212 c1) = 0, c2(1 \u2212 c2) = 0 .\nBut their introduction is justified by that general principle which has been stated\nin (II. 15) and (V. 6), and exemplified in nearly all our subsequent investigations,\nviz., that equations involving the symbols of Logic may be treated in all respects\nas if those symbols were symbols of quantity, subject to the special law x(1\u2212x) =\n0, until in the final stage of solution they assume a form interpretable in that\nsystem of thought with which Logic is conversant.\n3. The following example will serve to illustrate the above method.\nEx. 1.\u2013Suppose that an analysis of the properties of a particular class of\nsubstances has led to the following general conclusions, viz.:\n1st. That wherever the properties A and B are combined, either the property\nC, or the property D, is present also; but they are not jointly present.\n2nd. That wherever the properties B and C are combined, the properties A\nand D are either both present with them, or both absent.\n3rd. That wherever the properties A and B are both absent, the properties\nC and D are both absent also; and vice versa, where the properties C and D\nare both absent, A and B are both absent also.\nLet it then be required from the above to determine what may be concluded\nin any particular instance from the presence of the property A with respect to\nthe presence or absence of the properties B and C, paying no regard to the\nproperty D.\nRepresent the property A by x;\n\u201d the property B by y;\n\u201d the property C by z;\n\u201d the property D by w.\nThen the symbolical expression of the premises will be\nxy\u2212v(w(1\u2212z)+z(1\u2212w)); yz = v(xw+(1\u2212x)(1\u2212w)); (1\u2212x)(1\u2212y) = (1\u2212z)(1\u2212w).\nFrom the first two of these equations, separately eliminating the indefinite\nclass symbol v, we have\nxy(1 \u2212 w(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 z(1 \u2212 w)) = 0;\nyz(1 \u2212 xw \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 w)) = 0.\nNow if we observe that by development\n1 \u2212 w(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 z(1 \u2212 w) = wz + (1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 z),\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 91\nand\n1 \u2212 xw \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 w) = x(1 \u2212 w) + w(1 \u2212 x),\nand in these expressions replace, for simplicity,\n1 \u2212 xby\u00afx, 1 \u2212 yby \u00afy, &c.,\nwe shall have from the three last equations,\nxy(wz + \u00afw\u00afz) = 0; (1)\nyz(x \u00afw + \u00afxw) = 0; (2)\n\u00afx\u00afy = \u00afw\u00afz; (3)\nand from this system we must eliminate w.\nMultiplying the second of the above equations by c, and the third by c\u2032, and\nadding the results to the first, we have\nxy(wz + \u00afw\u00afz) + cyz(x \u00afw + \u00afxw) + c\u2032(\u00afx\u00afy \u2212 \u00afw\u00afz) = 0.\nWhen w is made equal to 1, and therefore \u00afw to 0, the first member of the\nabove equation becomes\nxyz + c\u00afxyz + c\u2032 \u00afx\u00afy.\nAnd when in the same member w is made 0 and \u00afw = 1, it becomes\nxy\u00afz + cxyz + c\u2032 \u00afx\u00afy \u2212 c\u2032 \u00afz.\nHence the result of the elimination of w may be expressed in the form\n(xyz + c\u00afxyz + c\u2032 \u00afx\u00afy)(xy\u00afz + cxyz + c\u2032 \u00afx\u00afy \u2212 c\u2032 \u00afz) = 0; (4)\nand from this equation x is to be determined.\nWere we now to proceed as in former instances, we should multiply together\nthe factors in the first member of the above equation ; but it may be well to\nshow that such a course is not at all necessary. Let us develop the first member\nof (4) with reference to x, the symbol whose expression is sought, we find\nyz(y\u00afz + cyz \u2212 c\u2032 \u00afz)x + (cyz + c\u2032 \u00afy)(c\u2032 \u00afy \u2212 c\u2032z)(1 \u2212 x) = 0;\nor, cyzx + (cyz + c\u2032 \u00afy)(c\u2032 \u00afy \u2212 c\u2032 \u00afz)(1 \u2212 x) = 0;\nwhence we find,\nx = (cyz + c\u2032 \u00afy)(c\u2032 \u00afy \u2212 c\u2032 \u00afz)\n(cyz + c\u2032 \u00afy)(c\u2032 \u00afy \u2212 c\u2032 \u00afz) \u2212 cyz ;\nand developing the second member with respect to y and z,\nx = 0yz + 0\n0 y\u00afz + c\u20322\nc\u20322 \u00afyz + 0\n0 \u00afy\u00afz;\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 92\nor,\nx = (1 \u2212 y) z + 0\n0 y (1 \u2212 z) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y) (1 \u2212 z) ;\nor,\nx = (1 \u2212 y) z + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 z) ;\nthe interpretation of which is, Wherever the property A is present, there either\nC is present and B absent, or C is absent. And inversely, Wherever the property\nC is present, and the property B absent, there the property A is present.\nThese results may be much more readily obtained by the method next to\nbe explained. It is, however, satisfactory to possess different modes, serving for\nmutual verification, of arriving at the same conclusion.\n4. We proceed to the second method.\nProposition II.\nIf any equations, V1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c., are such that the developments of\ntheir first members consist only of constituents with positive coefficients, those\nequations may be combined together into a single equivalent equation by addition.\nFor, as before, let At represent any term in the development of the function\nV1, Bt the corresponding term in the development of V2 and so on. Then will\nthe corresponding term in the development of the equation\nV1 + V2 + &c. = 0, (1)\nformed by the addition of the several given equations, be\n(A + B + &c.) t.\nBut as by hypothesis the coefficients A, B, &c. are none of them negative,\nthe aggregate coefficient A + B, &c. in the derived equation will only vanish\nwhen the separate coefficients A, B, &c. vanish together. Hence the same\nconstituents will appear in the development of the equation (1) as in the several\nequations V1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c. of the original system taken collectively, and\ntherefore the interpretation of the equation (1) will be equivalent to the collective\ninterpretations of the several equations from which it is derived.\nProposition III.\n5. If V1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c. represent any system of equations, the terms of\nwhich have by transposition been brought to like first side, then the combined\ninterpretation of the system will be involved in the single equation,\nV 2\n1 + V 2\n2 + &c. = 0,\nformed by adding together the squares of the given equations.\nFor let any equation of the system, as V1 = 0, produce on development an\nequation\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 93\na1t1 + a2t2 + &c. = 0\nin which t1, t2, &c. are constituents, and a1, a2, &c. their corresponding\ncoefficients. Then the equation V 2\n1 = 0 will produce on development an\nequation\na2\n1t1 + a2\n2t2 + &c. = 0,\nas may be proved either from the law of the development or by squaring the\nfunction a1t1 + a2t2, &c. in subjection to the conditions\nt2\n1 = t1, t2\n2 = t2, , t1t2 = 0\nassigned in Prop. 3, Chap. v. Hence the constituents which appear in\nthe expansion of the equation V 2\n1 = 0, are the same with those which appear\nin the expansion of the equation V1 = 0, and they have positive coefficients.\nAnd the same remark applies to the equations V2 = 0, &c. Whence, by the last\nProposition, the equation\nV 2\n1 + V 2\n2 + &c. = 0\nwill be equivalent in interpretation to the system of equations\nV1 = 0, V2 = 0, &c.\nCorollary.\u2013Any equation, V = 0, of which the first member already satisfies\nthe condition\nV 2 = V , or V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0,\ndoes not need (as it would remain unaffected by) the process of squaring.\nSuch equations are, indeed, immediately developable into a series of constituents,\nwith coefficients equal to 1, Chap. v. Prop. 4.\nProposition IV.\n6. Whenever the equations of a system have by the above process of squaring,\nor by any other process, been reduced to a form such that all the constituents\nexhibited in their development have positive coefficients, any derived equations\nobtained by elimination will possess the same character, and may be combined\nwith the other equations by addition.\nSuppose that we have to eliminate a symbol x from any equation V = 0,\nwhich is such that none of the constituents, in the full development of its first\nmember, have negative coefficients. That expansion may be written in the form\nV1x + V0(1 \u2212 x) = 0\nV1 and V0 being each of the form\na1t1 + a2t2... + antn,\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 94\nin which t1t2...tn are constituents of the other symbols, and a1a2...an in each\ncase positive or vanishing quantities. The result of elimination is\nV1V2 = 0;\nand as the coefficients in V1 and V2, are none of them negative, there can be no\nnegative coefficients in the product V1V2. Hence the equation V1V2 = 0 may be\nadded to any other equation, the coefficients of whose constituents are positive,\nand the resulting equation will combine the full significance of those from which\nit was obtained.\nProposition V.\n7. To deduce from the previous Propositions a practical rule or method for\nthe reduction of systems of equations expressing propositions in Logic.\nWe have by the previous investigations established the following points, viz.:\n1st. That any equations which are of the form V = 0, V satisfying the\nfundamental law of duality V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0, may be combined together by simple\naddition.\n2ndly. That any other equations of the form V = 0 may be reduced, by the\nprocess of squaring, to a form in which the same principle of combination by\nmere addition is applicable.\nIt remains then only to determine what equations in the actual expression\nof propositions belong to the former, and what to the latter, class.\nNow the general types of propositions have been set forth in the conclusion\nof Chap. IV. The division of propositions which they represent is as follows:\n1st. Propositions, of which the subject is universal, and the predicate\nparticular.\nThe symbolical type (IV. 15) is\nX = vY,\nX and Y satisfying the law of duality. Eliminating v, we have\nX(1 \u2212 Y ) = 0, (1)\nand this will be found also to satisfy the same law. No further reduction by\nthe process of squaring is needed.\n2nd. Propositions of which both terms are universal, and of which the\nsymbolical type is\nX = Y,\nX and Y separately satisfying the law of duality. Writing the equation in\nthe form X \u2212 Y = 0, and squaring, we have\nX \u2212 2XY + Y = 0,\nor, X(1 \u2212 Y ) + Y (1 \u2212 X) = 0. (2)\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 95\nThe first member of this equation satisfies the law of duality, as is evident\nfrom its very form.\nWe may arrive at the same equation in a different manner. The equation\nX = Y\nis equivalent to the two equations\nX = vY , Y = vX,\n(for to affirm that X\u2019s are identical with Y \u2019s is to affirm both that All X\u2019s\nare Y \u2019s, and that All Y \u2019s are X\u2019s). Now these equations give, on elimination of\nv,\nX(1 \u2212 Y ) = 0, Y (1 \u2212 X) = 0,\nwhich added, produce (2).\n3rd. Propositions of which both terms are particular. The form of such\npropositions is\nvX = vY,\nbut v is not quite arbitrary, and therefore must not be eliminated. For v is the\nrepresentative of some, which, though it may include in its meaning all, does\nnot include none. We must therefore transpose the second member to the first\nside, and square the resulting equation according to the rule. The result will\nobviously be\nvX(1 \u2212 Y ) + vY (l \u2212 X) = 0.\nThe above conclusions it may be convenient to embody in a Rule, which will\nserve for constant future direction.\n8. Rule.\u2014 The equations being so expressed as that the terms X and Y in\nthe following typical forms obey the law of duality, change the equations\nX = vY into X(1 \u2212 Y ) = 0,\nX = Y into X(1 \u2212 Y ) + Y (1 \u2212 X) = 0.\nvX = vY into vX(1 \u2212 Y ) + vY (1 \u2212 X) = 0.\nAny equation which is given in the form X = 0 will not need transformation,\nand any equation which presents itself in the form X = 1 may be replaced by\n1 \u2212 X = 0, as appears from the second of the above transformations.\nWhen the equations of the system have thus been reduced, any of them, as\nwell as any equations derived from them by the process of elimination, may be\ncombined by addition.\n9. Note.\u2013It has been seen in Chapter IV. that in literally translating the\nterms of a proposition, without attending to its real meaning, into the language\nof symbols, we may produce equations in which the terms X and Y do not\nobey the law of duality. The equation w = st(p + r), given in (3) Prop. 3 of the\nchapter referred to, is of this kind. Such equations, however, as it has been seen,\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 96\nhave a meaning. Should it, for curiosity, or for any other motive, be determined\nto employ them, it will be best to reduce them by the Rule (VI. 5).\n10. Ex. 2.\u2013Let us take the following Propositions of Elementary Geometry:\n1st. Similar figures consist of all whose corresponding angles are equal, and\nwhose corresponding sides are proportional.\n2nd. Triangles whose corresponding angles are equal have their corresponding\nsides proportional, and vice vers\u02c6a.\nTo represent these premises, let us make\ns = similar.\nt = triangles.\nq = having corresponding angles equal.\nr = having corresponding sides proportional.\nThen the premises are expressed by the following equations:\ns = qr, (1)\ntq = tr. (2)\nReducing by the Rule, or, which amounts to the same thing, bringing the terms\nof these equations to the first side, squaring each equation, and then adding, we\nhave\ns + qr \u2212 2qrs + tq + tr \u2212 2tqr = 0. (3)\nLet it be required to deduce a description of dissimilar figures formed out of the\nelements expressed by the terms, triangles, having corresponding angles equal,\nhaving corresponding sides proportional.\nWe have from (3),\ns = tq + qr + rt \u2212 2tqr\n2qr \u2212 1 ,\n\u2234 1 \u2212 s = qr \u2212 tq \u2212 rt + 2tqr \u2212 1\n2qr \u2212 1 . (4)\nAnd fully developing the second member, we find\n1 \u2212 s = 0tqr + 2tq(1 \u2212 r) + 2tr(1 \u2212 q) + t(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r)\n+0(1 \u2212 t)qr + (1 \u2212 t)q(1 \u2212 r) + (1 \u2212 t)r(1 \u2212 q)\n+(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r). (5)\nIn the above development two of the terms have the coefficient 2, these must\nbe equated to 0 by the Rule, then those terms whose coefficients are 0 being\nrejected, we have\n1 \u2212 s = t(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r) + (1 \u2212 t)q(1 \u2212 r) + (1 \u2212 t)r(1 \u2212 q)\n+(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r); (6)\ntq(1 \u2212 r) = 0; (7)\ntr(1 \u2212 q) = 0; (8)\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 97\nthe direct interpretation of which is\n1st. Dissimilar figures consist of all triangles which have not their corresponding\nangles equal and sides proportional, and of all figures not being triangles which\nhave either their angles equal, and sides not proportional, or their corresponding\nsides proportional, and angles not equal, or neither their corresponding angles\nequal nor corresponding sides proportional.\n2nd. There are no triangles whose corresponding angles are equal. and sides\nnot proportional.\n3rd. There are no triangles whose corresponding sides are proportional and\nangles not equal.\n11. Such are the immediate interpretations of the final equation. It is seen, in\naccordance with the general theory, that in deducing a description of a particular\nclass of objects, viz., dissimilar figures, in terms of certain other elements of the\noriginal premises, we obtain also the independent relations which exist among\nthose elements in virtue of the same premises. And that this is not superfluous\ninformation, even as respects the immediate object of inquiry, may easily be\nshown. For example, the independent relations may always be made use of\nto reduce, if it be thought desirable, to a briefer form, the expression of that\nrelation which is directly sought. Thus if we write (7) in the form\n0 = tq(l \u2212 r),\nand add it to (6), we get, since\nt(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r) + tq(1 \u2212 r) = t(1 \u2212 r),\n1 \u2212 s = t(1 \u2212 r) + (1 \u2212 t)q(1 \u2212 r) + (1 \u2212 t)r(1 \u2212 q)\n+(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r),\nwhich, on interpretation, would give for the first term of the description of\ndissimilar figures, \u201cTriangles whose corresponding sides are not proportional,\u201d\ninstead of the fuller description originally obtained. A regard to convenience\nmust always determine the propriety of such reduction.\n12. A reduction which is always advantageous (VII. 15) consists in collecting\nthe terms of the immediate description sought, as of the second member of (5)\nor (6), into as few groups as possible. Thus the third and fourth terms of the\nsecond member of (6) produce by addition the single term (1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 q). If this\nreduction be combined with the last, we have\n1 \u2212 s = t(1 \u2212 r) + (1 \u2212 t)q(1 \u2212 r) + (1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 q),\nthe interpretation of which is\nDissimilar figures consist of all triangles whose corresponding sides are\nnot proportional, and all figures not being triangles which have either their\ncorresponding angles unequal, or their corresponding angles equal, but sides not\nproportional.\nThe fulness of the general solution is therefore not a superfluity. While it\ngives us all the information that we seek, it provides us also with the means of\nexpressing that information in the mode that is most advantageous.\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 98\n13. Another observation, illustrative of a principle which has already been\nstated, remains to be made. Two of the terms in the full development of 1 \u2212 s in\n(5) have 2 for their coefficients, instead of 1\n0 . It will hereafter be shown that this\ncircumstance indicates that the two premises were not independent. To verify\nthis, let us resume the equations of the premises in their reduced forms, viz.,\ns(1 \u2212 qr) + qr(1 \u2212 s) = 0,\ntq(1 \u2212 r) + tr(1 \u2212 q) = 0.\nNow if the first members of these equations have any common constituents, they\nwill appear on multiplying the equations together. If we do this we obtain\nstq(1 \u2212 r) + str(1 \u2212 q) = 0.\nWhence there will result\nstq(1 \u2212 r) = 0, str(1 \u2212 q) = 0,\nthese being equations which are deducible from either of the primitive ones.\nTheir interpretations are\u2014\nSimilar triangles which have their corresponding angles equal have their\ncorresponding sides proportional.\nSimilar triangles which have their corresponding sides proportional have their\ncorresponding angles equal.\nAnd these conclusions are equally deducible from either premiss singly.\nIn this respect, according to the definitions laid down, the premises are not\nindependent.\n14. Let us, in conclusion, resume the problem discussed in illustration of the\nfirst method of this chapter, and endeavour to ascertain, by the present method,\nwhat may be concluded from the presence of the property C, with reference to\nthe properties A and B.\nWe found on eliminating the symbols v the following equations, viz.:\nxy(wz + \u00afw\u00afz) = 0, (1)\nyz(x \u00afw + \u00afxw) = 0, (2)\n\u00afx\u00afy = \u00afw\u00afz. (3)\nFrom these we are to eliminate w and determine z. Now (1) and (2) already\nsatisfy the condition V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0. The third equation gives, on bringing the\nterms to the first side, and squaring\n\u00afx\u00afy(1 \u2212 \u00afw\u00afz) + \u00afw\u00afz(1 \u2212 \u00afx\u00afy) = 0. (4)\nAdding (1) (2) and (4) together, we have\nxy(wz + \u00afw\u00afz) + yz(x \u00afw + \u00afxw) + \u00afx\u00afy(1 \u2212 \u00afw\u00afz) + \u00afw\u00afz(1 \u2212 \u00afx\u00afy) = 0.\nCHAPTER VIII. OF REDUCTION 99\nEliminating w, we get\n(xyz + yz \u00afx + \u00afx\u00afy){xy\u00afz + yzx + \u00afx\u00afyz + \u00afz(1 \u2212 \u00afx\u00afy)} = 0.\nNow, on multiplying the terms in the second factor by those in the first\nsuccessively, observing that\nx\u00afx = 0, y \u00afy = 0, z \u00afz = 0,\nnearly all disappear, and we have only left\nxyz + \u00afx\u00afyz = 0; (5)\nwhence\nz = 0\nxy + \u00afx\u00afy\n= 0xy + 0\n0 x\u00afy + 0\n0 \u00afxy + 0\u00afx\u00afy\n= 0\n0 x\u00afy + 0\n0 \u00afxy,\nfurnishing the interpretation. Wherever the property C is found, either the\nproperty A or the property B will be found with it, but not both of them together.\nFrom the equation (5) we may readily deduce the result arrived at in the\nprevious investigation by the method of arbitrary constant multipliers, as well\nas any other proposed forms of the relation between x, y, and z; e. g. If the\nproperty B is absent, either A and C will be jointly present, or C will be absent.\nAnd conversely, If A and C are jointly present, B will be absent. The converse\npart of this conclusion is founded on the presence of a term xz with unity for\nits coefficient in the developed value of \u00afy.\nChapter IX\nON CERTAIN METHODS OF ABBREVIATION.\n1. Though the three fundamental methods of development, elimination, and\nreduction, established and illustrated in the previous chapters, are sufficient for\nall the practical ends of Logic, yet there are certain cases in which they admit,\nand especially the method of elimination, of being simplified in an important\ndegree; and to these I wish to direct attention in the present chapter. I shall\nfirst demonstrate some propositions in which the principles of the above methods\nof abbreviation are contained, and I shall afterwards apply them to particular\nexamples.\nLet us designate as class terms any terms which satisfy the fundamental law\nV (1\u2212V ) = 0. Such terms will individually be constituents; but, when occurring\ntogether, will not, as do the terms of a development, necessarily involve the\nsame symbols in each. Thus ax + bxy + cyz may be described as an expression\nconsisting of three class terms, x, xy, and yz, multiplied by the coefficients a,\nb, c respectively. The principle applied in the two following Propositions, and\nwhich, in some instances, greatly abbreviates the process of elimination, is that\nof the rejection of superfluous class terms; those being regarded as superfluous\nwhich do not add to the constituents of the final result.\nProposition I.\n2. From any equation, V = 0, in which V consists of a series of class terms\nhaving positive coefficients, we are permitted to reject any term which contains\nanother term as a factor, and to change every positive coefficient to unity.\nFor the significance of this series of positive terms depends only upon the\nnumber and nature of the constituents of its final expansion, i.e. of its expansion\nwith reference to all the symbols which it involves, and not at all upon the actual\nvalues of the coefficients (VI. 5). Now let x be any term of the series, and xy\nany other term having x as a factor. The expansion of x with reference to the\nsymbols x and y will be\nxy + x (1 \u2212 y) ,\nand the expansion of the sum of the terms x and xy will be\n2xy + x (1 \u2212 y) .\n100\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 101\nBut by what has been said, these expressions occurring in the first member\nof an equation, of which the second member is 0, and of which all the coefficients\nof the first member are positive, are equivalent; since there must exist simply\nthe two constituents xy and x (1 \u2212 y) in the final expansion, whence will simply\narise the resulting equations\nxy = 0, x (1 \u2212 y) = 0.\nAnd, therefore, the aggregate of terms x + xy may be replaced by the single\nterm x.\nThe same reasoning applies to all the cases contemplated in the Proposition.\nThus, if the term x is repeated, the aggregate 2x may be replaced by x, because\nunder the circumstances the equation x = 0 must appear in the final reduction.\nProposition II.\n3. Whenever in the process of elimination we have to multiply together two\nfactors, each consisting solely of positive terms, satisfying the fundamental law\nof logical symbols, it is permitted to reject from both factors any common term,\nor from either factor any term which is divisible by a term in the other factor;\nprovided always, that the rejected term be added to the product of the resulting\nfactors.\nIn the enunciation of this Proposition, the word \u201cdivisible\u201d is a term of\nconvenience, used in the algebraic sense, in which xy and x (1 \u2212 y) are said to\nbe divisible by x.\nTo render more clear the import of this Proposition, let it be supposed that\nthe factors to be multiplied together are x + y + z and x + yw + t. It is then\nasserted, that from these two factors We may reject the term x, and that from\nthe second factor we may reject the term yw, provided that these terms be\ntransferred to the final product. Thus, the resulting factors being y + z and t,\nif to their product yt + zt we add the terms x and yw, we have\nx + yw + yt + zt,\nas an expression equivalent to the product of the given factors x + y + z and\nx + yw + t; equivalent namely in the process of elimination.\nLet us consider, first, the case in which the two factors have a common term\nx, and let us represent the factors by the expressions x + P , x + Q, supposing P\nin the one case and Q in the other to be the sum of the positive terms additional\nto x.\nNow,\n(x + P )(x + Q) = x + xP + xQ + P Q. (1)\nBut the process of elimination consists in multiplying certain factors together,\nand equating the result to 0. Either then the second member of the above\nequation is to be equated to 0, or it is a factor of some expression which is to\nbe equated to 0.\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 102\nIf the former alternative be taken, then, by the last Proposition, we are\npermitted to reject the terms xP and xQ, inasmuch as they are positive terms\nhaving another term x as a factor. The resulting expression is\nx + P Q,\nwhich is what we should obtain by rejecting x from both factors, and adding it\nto the product of the factors which remain.\nTaking the second alternative, the only mode in which the second member of\n(1) can affect the final result of elimination must depend upon the number and\nnature of its constituents, both which elements are unaffected by the rejection\nof the terms xP and xQ. For that development of x includes all possible\nconstituents of which x is a factor.\nConsider finally the case in which one of the factors contains a term, as xy,\ndivisible by a term, x, in the other factor.\nLet x + P and xy + Q be the factors. Now\n(x + P )(xy + Q) = xy + xQ + xyP + P Q.\nBut by the reasoning of the last Proposition, the term xyP may be rejected as\ncontaining another positive term xy as a factor, whence we have\nxy + xQ + P Q\n= xy + (x + P )Q.\nBut this expresses the rejection of the term xy from the second factor, and its\ntransference to the final product. Wherefore the Proposition is manifest.\nProposition III.\n4. If t be any symbol which is retained in the final result of the elimination of\nany other symbols from any system of equations, the result of such elimination\nmay be expressed in the form\nEt + E (1 \u2212 t) = 0,\nin which E is formed by making in the proposed system t = 1, and eliminating\nthe same other symbols; and E\u2032 by making in the proposed system t = 0, and\neliminating the same other symbols.\nFor let \u03d5 (t) = 0 represent the final result of elimination. Expanding this\nequation, we have\n\u03d5 (1) t + \u03d5 (0) (1 \u2212 t) = 0.\nNow by whatever process we deduce the function \u03d5 (t) from the proposed system\nof equations, by the same process should we deduce \u03d5 (1), if in those equations\nt were changed into 1; and by the same process should we deduce \u03d5 (0), if in the\nsame equations t were changed into 0. Whence the truth of the proposition is\nmanifest.\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 103\n5. Of the three propositions last proved, it may be remarked, that though\nquite unessential to the strict development or application of the general theory,\nthey yet accomplish important ends of a practical nature. By Prop. 1 we\ncan simplify the results of addition; by Prop. 2 we can simplify those of\nmultiplication; and by Prop. 3 we can break up any tedious process of\nelimination into two distinct processes, which will in general be of a much\nless complex character. This method will be very frequently adopted, when the\nfinal object of inquiry is the determination of the value of t, in terms of the\nother symbols which remain after the elimination is performed.\n6. Ex. 1.\u2014Aristotle, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Book II. Cap. 3, having\ndetermined that actions are virtuous, not as possessing in themselves a certain\ncharacter, but as implying a certain condition of mind in him who performs\nthem, viz., that he perform them knowingly, and with deliberate preference,\nand for their own sakes, and upon fixed principles of conduct, proceeds in the\ntwo following chapters to consider the question, whether virtue is to be referred\nto the genus of Passions, or Faculties, or Habits, together with some other\nconnected points. He grounds his investigation upon the following premises,\nfrom which, also, he deduces the general doctrine and definition of moral virtue,\nof which the remainder of the treatise forms an exposition.\npremises.\n1. Virtue is either a passion (\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2), or a faculty (\u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2), or a habit (\u1f15\u03be\u03b9\u03c2).\n2. Passions are not things according to which we are praised or blamed, or\nin which we exercise deliberate preference.\n3. Faculties are not things according to which we are praised or blamed, and\nwhich are accompanied by deliberate preference.\n4. Virtue is something according to which we are praised or blamed, and\nwhich is accompanied by deliberate preference.\n5. Whatever art or science makes its work to be in a good state avoids\nextremes, and keeps the mean in view relative to human nature (\u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\n. . . \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f20\u03bc\u02dc\u03b1\u03c2)\n6. Virtue is more exact and excellent than any art or science. This is an\nargument `a fortiori. If science and true art shun defect and extravagance alike,\nmuch more does virtue pursue the undeviating line of moderation. If they cause\ntheir work to be in a good state, much more reason have to we to say that\nVirtue causeth her peculiar work to be \u201cin a good state.\u201d Let the final premiss\nbe thus interpreted. Let us also pretermit all reference to praise or blame, since\nthe mention of these in the premises accompanies only the mention of deliberate\npreference, and this is an element which we purpose to retain. We may then\nassume as our representative symbols\u2013\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 104\nv = virtue.\np = passions.\nf = faculties.\nh = habits.\nd = things accompanied by deliberate preference.\ng = things causing their work to be in a good state.\nm = things keeping the mean in view relative to human nature.\nUsing, then, q as an indefinite class symbol, our premises will be expressed by\nthe following equations:\nv = q {p (1 \u2212 f ) (1 \u2212 h) + f (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 h) + h (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 f )} .\np = q (1 \u2212 d) .\nf = q (1 \u2212 d) .\nv = qd.\ng = qm.\nv = qg.\nAnd separately eliminating from these the symbols q,\nv{1 \u2212 p (1 \u2212 f ) (1 \u2212 h) \u2212 f (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 h) \u2212 h (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 f )} = 0. (1)\npd = 0. (2)\nf d = 0. (3)\nv (1 \u2212 d) = 0. (4)\ng (1 \u2212 m) = 0. (5)\nv (1 \u2212 g) = 0. (6)\nWe shall first eliminate from (2), (3), and (4) the symbol d, and then determine\nv in relation to p, f , and h. Now the addition of (2), (3), and (4) gives\n(p + f ) d + v (1 \u2212 d) = 0.\nFrom which, eliminating d in the ordinary way, we find\n(p + f ) v = 0. (7)\nAdding this to (1), and determining v, we find\nv = 0\np + f + 1 \u2212 p (1 \u2212 f ) (1 \u2212 h) \u2212 f (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 h) \u2212 h (1 \u2212 f ) (1 \u2212 p) .\nWhence by development,\nv = 0\n0 h (1 \u2212 f ) (1 \u2212 p) .\nThe interpretation of this equation is: Virtue is a habit, and not a faculty or a\npassion.\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 105\nNext, we will eliminate f , p, and g from the original system of equations,\nand then determine v in relation to h, d, and m. We will in this case eliminate\np and f together. On addition of (1), (2), and (3), we get\nv{1 \u2212 p(1 \u2212 f )(1 \u2212 h) \u2212 f (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 h) \u2212 h(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 f )}\n+pd + f d = 0.\nDeveloping this with reference to p and f , we have\n(v + 2d)pf + (vh + d)p(1 \u2212 f ) + (vh + d)(1 \u2212 p)f\n+v(1 \u2212 h)(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 f ) = 0.\nWhence the result of elimination will be\n(v + 2d)(vh + d)(vh + d)v(1 \u2212 h) = 0.\nNow v + 2d = v + d + d, which by Prop. I. is reducible to v + d. The product\nof this and the second factor is\n(v + d)(vh + d),\nwhich by Prop. II. reduces to d + v(vh) or vh + d.\nIn like manner, this result, multiplied by the third factor, gives simply vh+d.\nLastly, this multiplied by the fourth factor, v(1 \u2212 h), gives, as the final equation,\nvd(l \u2212 h) = 0 (8)\nIt remains to eliminate g from (5) and (6). The result is\nv(1 \u2212 m) = 0 (9)\nFinally, the equations (4), (8), and (9) give on addition\nv(1 \u2212 d) + vd(1 \u2212 h) + v(1 \u2212 m) = 0\nfrom which we have\nv = 0\n1 \u2212 d + d(1 \u2212 h) + 1 \u2212 m .\nAnd the development of this result gives\nv = 0\n0 hdm,\nf which the interpretation is,\u2013Virtue is a habit accompanied by deliberate\npreference, and keeping in view the mean relative to human nature.\nProperly speaking, this is not a definition, but a description of virtue. It is\nall, however, that can be correctly inferred from the premises. Aristotle specially\nconnects with it the necessity of prudence, to determine the safe and middle line\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 106\nof action; and there is no doubt that the ancient theories of virtue generally\npartook more of an intellectual character than those (the theory of utility\nexcepted) which have most prevailed in modern days. Virtue was regarded as\nconsisting in the right state and habit of the whole mind, rather than in the single\nsupremacy of conscience or the moral facility. And to some extent those theories\nwere undoubtedly right. For though unqualified obedience to the dictates of\nconscience is an essential element of virtuous conduct, yet the conformity of\nthose dictates with those unchanging principles of rectitude (\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1)which\nare founded in, or which rather are themselves the foundation of the constitution\nof things, is another element. And generally this conformity, in any high degree\nat least, is inconsistent with a state of ignorance and mental hebetude. Reverting\nto the particular theory of Aristotle, it will probably appear to most that it is\nof too negative a character, and that the shunning of extremes does not afford a\nsufficient scope for the expenditure of the nobler energies of our being. Aristotle\nseems to have been imperfectly conscious of this defect of his system, when in\nthe opening of his seventh book he spoke of an \u201cheroic virtue\u201d1 rising above the\nmeasure of human nature.\n7. I have already remarked (VIII. 1) that the theory of single equations or\npropositions comprehends questions which cannot be fully answered, except in\nconnexion with the theory of systems of equations. This remark is exemplified\nwhen it is proposed to determine from a given single equation the relation, not\nof some single elementary class, but of some compound class, involving in its\nexpression more than one element, in terms of the remaining elements. The\nfollowing particular example, and the succeeding general problem, are of this\nnature.\nEx. 2.\u2014Let us resume the symbolical expression of the definition of wealth\nemployed in Chap, VII., viz.,\nw = st {p + r (1 \u2212 p)} ,\nwherein, as before,\nw = wealth,\ns = things limited in supply,\nt = things transferable,\np = things productive of pleasure,\nr = things preventive of pain;\nand suppose it required to determine hence the relation of things transferable\nand productive of pleasure, to the other elements of the definition, viz., wealth,\nthings limited in supply, and things preventive of pain.\nThe expression for things transferable and productive of pleasure is tp. Let\nus represent this by a new symbol y. We have then the equations\nw = st {p + r (1 \u2212 p)} ,\ny = tp,\n1\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03cd\u03c0\u1f72\u03c1 \u1f74\u03bc\u1f05\u03c2 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f74\u03c1\u03c9\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u2013Nic. Eth. Book vii.\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 107\nfrom which, if we eliminate t and p, we may determine y as a function of w, s,\nand r. The result interpreted will give the relation sought.\nBringing the terms of these equations to the first side, we have\nw \u2212 stp \u2212 str (1 \u2212 p) = 0.\ny \u2212 tp = 0. (3)\nAnd adding the squares of these equations together,\nw + stp + str (1 \u2212 p) \u2212 2wstp \u2212 2wstr (1 \u2212 p) + y + tp \u2212 2ytp = 0. (4)\nDeveloping the first member with respect to t and p, in order to eliminate those\nsymbols, we have\n(w + s \u2212 2ws + 1 \u2212 y) tp + (w + sr \u2212 2wsr + y) t (1 \u2212 p)\n+ (w + y) (1 \u2212 t) p + (w + y) (1 \u2212 t) (1 \u2212 p) ; (5)\nand the result of the elimination of t and p will be obtained by equating to 0\nthe product of the four coefficients of\ntp, t (1 \u2212 p) , (1 \u2212 t) p, and (1 \u2212 t) (1 \u2212 p) .\nOr, by Prop. 3, the result of the elimination of t and p from the above\nequation will be of the form\nEy + E\u2032 (1 \u2212 y) ,\nwherein E is the result obtained by changing in the given equation y into 1,\nand then eliminating t and p; and E\u2032 the result obtained by changing in the\nsame equation y into 0, and then eliminating t and p. And the mode in each\ncase of eliminating t and p is to multiply together the coefficients of the four\nconstituents tp, t (1 \u2212 p), &c.\nIf we make y = 1, the coefficients become\u2013\n1st. w (1 \u2212 s) + s (1 \u2212 w)\n2nd. 1 + w (1 \u2212 sr) + s (1 \u2212 w) r, equivalent to 1 by Prop. I.\n3rd and 4th. 1 + w, equivalent to 1 by Prop. I.\nHence the value of E will be\nw (1 \u2212 s) + s (1 \u2212 w) .\nAgain, in (5) making y = 0, we have for the coefficients\u2013\n1st. 1 + w (1 \u2212 s) + s (1 \u2212 w), equivalent to 1.\n2nd. w (1 \u2212 sr) + sr (1 \u2212 w).\n3rd and 4th. w.\nThe product of these coefficients gives\nE\u2032 = w (1 \u2212 sr) .\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 108\nThe equation from which y is to be determined, therefore, is\n{w(1 \u2212 s) + s(1 \u2212 w)} y + w(1 \u2212 sr)(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\n\u2234 y = w(1 \u2212 sr)\nw(1 \u2212 sr) \u2212 w(1 \u2212 s) \u2212 s(1 \u2212 w) ;\nand expanding the second member,\ny = 0\n0 wsr + ws(1 \u2212 r) + 1\n0 w(1 \u2212 s)r + 1\n0 w(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 r)\n+0(1 \u2212 w)sr + 0(1 \u2212 w)s(1 \u2212 r) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 s)r\n+ 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 r);\nwhence reducing.\ny = ws(1 \u2212 r) + 0\n0 wsr + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 s), (6)\nwith w(1 \u2212 s) = 0. (7)\nThe interpretation of which is\u2013\n1st. Things transferable and productive of pleasure consist of all wealth\n(limited in supply and) not preventive of pain, an indefinite amount of wealth\n(limited in supply and) preventive of pain, and an indefinite amount of what is\nnot wealth and not limited in supply.\n2nd. All wealth is limited in supply.\nI have in the above solution written in parentheses that part of the full\ndescription which is implied by the accompanying independent relation (7).\n8. The following problem is of a more general nature, and will furnish an\neasy practical rule for problems such as the last.\nGeneral Problem.\nGiven any equation connecting the symbols x, y..w, z..\nRequired to determine the logical expression of any class expressed in any\nway by the symbols x, y.. in terms of the remaining symbols, w, z, &c.\nLet us confine ourselves to the case in which there are but two symbols, x,\ny, and two symbols, w, z, a case sufficient to determine the general Rule.\nLet V = 0 be the given equation, and let \u03d5(x, y) represent the class whose\nexpression is to be determined.\nAssume t = \u03d5(x, y), then, from the above two equations, x and y are to be\neliminated.\nNow the equation V = 0 may be expanded in the form\nAxy + Bx(1 \u2212 y) + C(1 \u2212 x)y + D(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 0, (1)\nA, B, C, and D being functions of the symbols w and z.\nAgain, as \u03d5(x, y) represents a class or collection of things, it must consist of\na constituent, or series of constituents, whose coefficients are 1.\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 109\nWherefore if the full development of \u03d5(x, y) be represented in the form\naxy + bx(1 \u2212 y) + c(1 \u2212 x)y + d(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y),\nthe coefficients a, b, c, d must each be 1 or 0.\nNow reducing the equation t = \u03d5(x, y) by transposition and squaring, to the\nform\nt1 \u2212 \u03d5(x, y) + \u03d5(x, y)(1 \u2212 t) = 0;\nand expanding with reference to x and y, we get\nt(1 \u2212 a) + a(1 \u2212 t)xy + t(1 \u2212 b) + b(1 \u2212 t)x(1 \u2212 y)\n+t(1 \u2212 c) + c(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 x)y\n+t(1 \u2212 d) + d(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 0;\nwhence, adding this to (1), we have\nA + t(1 \u2212 a) + a(1 \u2212 t)xy\n+B + t(l \u2212 b) + b(l \u2212 t)x(1 \u2212 y) + &c. = 0.\nLet the result of the elimination of x and y be of the form\nEt + E\u2032(1 \u2212 t) = 0,\nthen E will, by what has been said, be the reduced product of what the\ncoefficients of the above expansion become when t = 1 , and E\u2032 the product of\nthe same factors similarly reduced by the condition t = 0.\nHence E will be the reduced product\n(A + 1 \u2212 a)(B + 1 \u2212 b)(C + 1 \u2212 c)(D + 1 \u2212 d).\nConsidering any factor of this expression, as A + 1 \u2212 a, we see that when a = 1\nit becomes A, and when a = 0 it becomes 1 + A, which reduces by Prop. I. to\n1. Hence we may infer that E will be the product of the coefficients of those\nconstituents in the development of V whose coefficients in the development of\n\u03d5(x, y) are 1.\nMoreover E\u2032 will be the reduced product\n(A + a)(B + b)(C + c)(D + d).\nConsidering any one of these factors, as A + a, we see that this becomes A\nwhen a = 0, and reduces to 1 when a = 1 ; and so on for the others. Hence E\nwill be the product of the coefficients of those constituents in the development\nof y, whose coefficients in the development \u03d5(x, y) are 0. Viewing these cases\ntogether, we may establish the following Rule:\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 110\n9. To deduce from a logical equation the relation of any class expressed by\na given combination of the symbols x, y, &c, to the classes represented by any\nother symbols involved in the given equation.\nRule.\u2013Expand the given equation with reference to the symbols x, y. Then\nform the equation\nEt + E\u2032(1 \u2212 t) = 0,\nin which E is the product of the coefficients of all those constituents in the above\ndevelopment, whose coefficients in the expression of the given class are 1, and\nE\u2032 the product of the coefficients of those constituents of the development whose\ncoefficients in the expression of the given class are 0. The value of t deduced\nfrom the above equation by solution and interpretation will be the expression\nrequired.\nNote.\u2013Although in the demonstration of this Rule V is supposed to consist\nsolely of positive terms, it may easily be shown that this condition is unnecessary,\nand the Rule general, and that no preparation of the given equation is really\nrequired.\n10. Ex. 3.\u2013The same definition of wealth being given as in Example 2,\nrequired an expression for things transferable, but not productive of pleasure,\nt(1 \u2212 p), in terms of the other elements represented by w, s, and r.\nThe equation\nw \u2212 stp \u2212 str(1 \u2212 p) = 0,\ngives, when squared,\nw + stp + str(1 \u2212 p) \u2212 2wstp \u2212 2wstr(1 \u2212 p) = 0;\nand developing the first member with respect to t and p,\n(w + s \u2212 2ws)tp + (w + sr \u2212 2wsr)t(1 \u2212 p) + w(1 \u2212 t)p\n+w(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 p) = 0.\nThe coefficients of which it is best to exhibit as in the following equation;\nw(1 \u2212 s) + s(1 \u2212 w)tp + w(1 \u2212 sr) + sr(1 \u2212 w)t(1 \u2212 p) + w(1 \u2212 t)p\n+w(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 p) = 0\nLet the function t(1 \u2212 p) to be determined, be represented by z; then the\nfull development of z in respect of t and p is\nz = 0tp + t(1 \u2212 p) + 0(1 \u2212 t)p + 0(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 p).\nHence, by the last problem, we have\nEz + E\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = 0;\nwhere E = w(1 \u2212 sr) + sr(1 \u2212 w);\nE\u2032 = w(1 \u2212 s) + s(1 \u2212 w) \u00d7 w \u00d7 w = w(1 \u2212 s);\n\u2234 w(1 \u2212 sr) + sr(1 \u2212 w)z + w(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 z) = 0.\nCHAPTER IX.

From the domain of natural history a large number of curious examples\nmight be selected. I do not, however, conceive that such applications would\npossess any independent value. They would, for instance, throw no light upon\nthe true principles of classification in the science of zoology. For the discovery\nof these, some basis of positive knowledge is requisite,\u2013some acquaintance with\norganic structure, with teleological adaptation; and this is a species of knowledge\nwhich can only be derived from the use of external means of observation and\nanalysis. Taking, however, any collection of propositions in natural history,\na great number of logical problems present themselves, without regard to the\nsystem of classification adopted. Perhaps in forming such examples, it is better\nto avoid, as superfluous, the mention of that property of a class or species which\nis immediately suggested by its name, e.g. the ring-structure in the annelida, a\nclass of animals including the earth-worm and the leech.\nEx. 4.\u20131. The annelida are soft-bodied, and either naked or enclosed in a\ntube.\n2. The annelida consist of all invertebrate animals having red blood in a\ndouble system of circulating vessels.\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 112\nAssume a = annelida;\ns = soft-bodied animals;\nn = naked;\nt = enclosed in a tube;\ni = invertebrate;\nr = having red blood, &c.\nThen the propositions given will be expressed by the equations\na = vsn(1 \u2212 t) + t(1 \u2212 n); (1)\na = ir; (2)\nto which we may add the implied condition,\nnt = 0. (3)\nOn eliminating v, and reducing the system to a single equation, we have\na[1 \u2212 sn(1 \u2212 t) \u2212 st(1 \u2212 n)] + a(1 \u2212 ir) + ir(1 \u2212 a) + nt = 0. (4)\nSuppose that we wish to obtain the relation in which soft-bodied animals\nenclosed in tubes arc placed (by virtue of the premises) with respect to the\nfollowing elements, viz., the possession of red blood, of an external covering,\nand of a vertebral column.\nWe must first eliminate a. The result is\nir1 \u2212 sn(1 \u2212 t) \u2212 st(1 \u2212 n) + nt = 0.\nThen (IX. 9) developing with respect to s and t, and reducing the first\ncoefficient by Prop. 1, we have\nnst + ir(1 \u2212 n)s(1 \u2212 t) + (ir + n)(1 \u2212 s)t + ir(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t) = 0.

METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 113\nHence, soft-bodied animals enclosed in tubes consist of all invertebrate\nanimals having red blood and not naked, and an indefinite remainder of\ninvertebrate animals not having red blood and not naked, and of vertebrate\nanimals which are not naked.\nAnd in an exactly similar manner, the following reduced equations, the\ninterpretation of which is left to the reader, have been deduced from the\ndevelopment (5).\ns(1 \u2212 t) = irn + 0\n0 i(1 \u2212 n) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 i)\n(1 \u2212 s)t = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 i)r(1 \u2212 n) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 n)\n(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t) = 0\n0 i(1 \u2212 r) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 i).\nIn none of the above examples has it been my object to exhibit in any special\nmanner the power of the method. That, I conceive, can only be fully displayed\nin connexion with the mathematical theory of probabilities. I would, however,\nsuggest to any who may be desirous of forming a correct opinion upon this\npoint, that they examine by the rules of ordinary logic the following problem,\nbefore inspecting its solution; remembering at the same time, that whatever\ncomplexity it possesses might be multiplied indefinitely, with no other effect\nthan to render its solution by the method of this work more operose, but not\nless certainly attainable.\nEx. 5. Let the observation of a class of natural productions be supposed to\nhave led to the following general results.\n1st, That in whichsoever of these productions the properties A and C are\nmissing, the property E is found, together with one of the properties B and D,\nbut not with both.\n2nd, That wherever the properties A and D are found while E is missing,\nthe properties B and C will either both be found, or both be missing.\n3rd, That wherever the property A is found in conjunction with either B\nor E, or both of them, there either the property C or the property D will be\nfound, but not both of them. And conversely, wherever the property C or D is\nfound singly, there the property A will be found in conjunction with either B\nor E, or both of them.\nLet it then be required to ascertain, first, what in any particular instance may\nbe concluded from the ascertained presence of the property A, with reference\nto the properties B, C, and D; also whether any relations exist independently\namong the properties B, C, and D. Secondly, what may be concluded in like\nmanner respecting the property B, and the properties A, C, and D.\nIt will be observed, that in each of the three data, the information conveyed\nrespecting the properties A, B, C, and D, is complicated with another element,\nE, about which we desire to say nothing in our conclusion. It will hence be\nrequisite to eliminate the symbol representing the property E from the system\nof equations, by which the given propositions will be expressed.\nCHAPTER IX. METHODS OF ABBREVIATION 114\nLet us represent the property A by x, B by y, C by z, D by w, E by v. The\ndata are\n\u00afx\u00afz = qv(y \u00afw + w\u00afy); (1)\n\u00afvxw = q(yz + \u00afy\u00afz); (2)\nxy + xv \u00afy = w\u00afz + z \u00afw; (3)\n\u00afx standing for 1\u2212x, &c., and q being an indefinite class symbol. Eliminating\nq separately from the first and second equations, and adding the results to the\nthird equation reduced by (5), Chap.VIII., we get\n\u00afx\u00afz(1 \u2212 vy \u00afw \u2212 vw\u00afy) + \u00afvxw(y\u00afz + z \u00afy) + (xy + xv \u00afy)(wz + \u00afw\u00afz)\n+ (w\u00afz + z \u00afw)(1 \u2212 xy \u2212 xv \u00afy) = 0.

The subject of Primary Propositions has been discussed at length, and we are\nabout to enter upon the consideration of Secondary Propositions. The interval\nof transition between these two great divisions of the science of Logic may afford\na fit occasion for us to pause, and while reviewing some of the past steps of our\nprogress, to inquire what it is that in a subject like that with which we have\nbeen occupied constitutes perfection of method. I do not here speak of that\nperfection only which consists in power, but of that also which is founded in the\nconception of what is fit and beautiful. It is probable that a careful analysis\nof this question would conduct us to some such conclusion as the following,\nviz., that a perfect method should not only be an efficient one, as respects the\naccomplishment of the objects for which it is designed, but should in all its parts\nand processes manifest a certain unity and harmony. This conception would be\nmost fully realized if even the very forms of the method were suggestive of\nthe fundamental principles, and if possible of the one fundamental principle,\nupon which they are founded. In applying these considerations to the science\nof Reasoning, it may be well to extend our view beyond the mere analytical\nprocesses, and to inquire what is best as respects not only the mode or form of\ndeduction, but also the system of data or premises from which the deduction is\nto be made.\n2. As respects mere power, there is no doubt that the first of the methods\ndeveloped in Chapter VIII. is, within its proper sphere, a perfect one. The\nintroduction of arbitrary constants makes us independent of the forms of the\npremises, as well as of any conditions among the equations by which they are\nrepresented. But it seems to introduce a foreign element, and while it is a more\nlaborious, it is also a less elegant form of solution than the second method of\nreduction demonstrated in the same chapter. There are, however, conditions\nunder which the latter method assumes a more perfect form than it otherwise\nbears. To make the one fundamental condition expressed by the equation\nx(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nthe universal type of form, would give a unity of character to both processes\nand results, which would not else be attainable. Were brevity or convenience the\n117\nCHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 118\nonly valuable quality of a method, no advantage would flow from the adoption\nof such a principle. For to impose upon every step of a solution the character\nabove described, would involve in some instances no slight labour of preliminary\nreduction. But it is still interesting to know that this can be done, and it is even\nof some importance to be acquainted with the conditions under which such a\nform of solution would spontaneously present itself. Some of these points will\nbe considered in the present chapter.\nProposition I.\n3. To reduce any equation among logical symbols to the form V = 0, in which\nV satisfies the law of duality,\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nIt is shown in Chap. V. Prop. 4, that the above condition is satisfied\nwhenever V is the sum of a series of constituents. And it is evident from\nProp. 2, Chap. VI. that all equations are equivalent which, when reduced\nby transposition to the form V = 0, produce, by development of the first\nmember, the same series of constituents with coefficients which do not vanish;\nthe particular numerical values of those coefficients being immaterial.\nHence the object of this Proposition may always be accomplished by bringing\nall the terms of an equation to the first side, fully expanding that member, and\nchanging in the result all the coefficients which do not vanish into unity, except\nsuch as have already that value.\nBut as the development of functions containing many symbols conducts us\nto expressions inconvenient from their great length, it is desirable to show how,\nin the only cases which do practically offer themselves to our notice, this source\nof complexity may be avoided.\nThe great primary forms of equations have already been discussed in Chapter\nVIII. They are\u2013\nX = vY,\nX = Y,\nvX = vY.\nWhenever the conditions X(1 \u2212 X) = 0, Y (1 \u2212 Y ) = 0, are satisfied, we have\nseen that the two first of the above equations conduct us to the forms\nX(1 \u2212 Y ) = 0, (1)\nX(1 \u2212 Y ) + Y (1 \u2212 X) = 0; (2)\nand under the same circumstances it may be shown that the last of them\ngives\nCHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 119\nv(X(1 \u2212 Y ) + Y (1 \u2212 X)) = 0; (3)\nall which results obviously satisfy, in their first members, the condition\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nNow as the above are the forms and conditions under which the equations\nof a logical system properly expressed do actually present themselves, it is\nalways possible to reduce them by the above method into subjection to the\nlaw required. Though, however, the separate equations may thus satisfy the\nlaw, their equivalent sum (VIII. 4) may not do so, and it remains to show how\nupon it also the requisite condition may be imposed.\nLet us then represent the equation formed by adding the several reduced\nequations of the system together, in the form\nv + v\u2032 + v\u2032\u2032, &c. = 0, (4)\nthis equation being singly equivalent to the system from which it was\nobtained. We suppose v, v\u2032, v\u2032\u2032, &c. to be class terms (IX. 1) satisfying the\nconditions\nv(1 \u2212 v) = 0, v\u2032(1 \u2212 v\u2032) = 0, &c.\nNow the full interpretation of (4) would be found by developing the first\nmember with respect to all the elementary symbols x, y, &c. which it contains,\nand equating to 0 all the constituents whose coefficients do not vanish; in other\nwords, all the constituents which are found in either v, v\u2032, v\u2032\u2032, &c. But those\nconstituents consist of\u20131st, such as are found in v; 2nd, such as are not found in\nv, but are found in v\u2032; 3rd, such as are neither found in v nor v\u2032, but are found\nin v\u2032\u2032, and so on. Hence they will be such as are found in the expression\nv + (1 \u2212 v)v\u2032 + (1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 v)v\u2032\u2032 + &c., (5)\nan expression in which no constituents are repeated, and which obviously\nsatisfies the law V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nThus if we had the expression\n(1 \u2212 t) + v + (1 \u2212 z) + tzw,\nin which the terms 1 \u2212 t, 1 \u2212 z are bracketed to indicate that they are to be\ntaken as single class terms, we should, in accordance with (5), reduce it to an\nexpression satisfying the condition V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0, by multiplying all the terms\nafter the first by t, then all after the second by 1 \u2212 v; lastly, the term which\nremains after the third by z; the result being\n1 \u2212 t + tv + t(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 z) + t(1 \u2212 v)zw. (6)\n4. All logical equations then are reducible to the form V = 0, V satisfying\nthe law of duality. But it would obviously be a higher degree of perfection\nCHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 120\nif equations always presented themselves in such a form, without preparation\nof any kind, and not only exhibited this form in their original statement, but\nretained it unimpaired after those additions which are necessary in order to\nreduce systems of equations to single equivalent forms. That they do not\nspontaneously present this feature is not properly attributable to defect of\nmethod, but is a consequence of the fact that our premises are not always\ncomplete, and accurate, and independent. They are not complete when\nthey involve material (as distinguished from formal) relations, which are not\nexpressed. They are not accurate when they imply relations which are not\nintended. But setting aside these points, with which, in the present instance,\nwe are less concerned, let it be considered in what sense they may fail of being\nindependent.\n5. A system of propositions may be termed independent, when it is not\npossible to deduce from any portion of the system a conclusion deducible from\nany other portion of it. Supposing the equations representing those propositions\nall reduced to the form\nV = 0,\nthen the above condition implies that no constituent which can be made to\nappear in the development of a particular function V of the system, can be made\nto appear in the development of any other function V \u2032 of the same system. When\nthis condition is not satisfied, the equations of the system are not independent.\nThis may happen in various cases. Let all the equations satisfy in their first\nmembers the law of duality, then if there appears a positive term x in the\nexpansion of one equation, and a term xy in that of another, the equations are\nnot independent, for the term x is further developable into xy + x(1 \u2212 y), and\nthe equation\nxy = 0\nis thus involved in both the equations of the system. Again, let a term xy appear\nin one equation, and a term xz in another. Both these may be developed so as\nto give the common constituent xyz. And other cases may easily be imagined\nin which premises which appear at first sight to be quite independent are not\nreally so. Whenever equations of the form V = 0 are thus not truly independent,\nthough individually they may satisfy the law of duality,\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0,\nthe equivalent equation obtained by adding them together will not satisfy that\ncondition, unless sufficient reductions by the method of the present chapter\nhave been performed. When, on the other hand, the equations of a system both\nsatisfy the above law, and are independent of each other, their sum will also\nsatisfy the same law. I have dwelt upon these points at greater length than\nwould otherwise have been necessary, because it appears to me to be important\nto endeavour to form to ourselves, and to keep before us in all our investigations,\nthe pattern of an ideal perfection,\u2014the object and the guide of future efforts. In\nthe present class of inquiries the chief aim of improvement of method should be\nCHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 121\nto facilitate, as far as is consistent with brevity, the transformation of equations,\nso as to make the fundamental condition above adverted to universal.\nIn connexion with this subject the following Propositions are deserving of\nattention.\nProposition II.\nIf the first member of any equation V = 0 satisfy the condition V (1 \u2212 V ) =\n0, and if the expression of any symbol t of that equation be determined as a\ndeveloped function of the other symbols, the coefficients of the expansion can\nonly assume the forms 1, 0, 0\n0 , 1\n0 .\nFor if the equation be expanded with reference to t, we obtain as the result,\nEt + E\u2032(1 \u2212 t), (1)\nE and E\u2032 being what V becomes when t is successively changed therein into 1\nand 0. Hence E and E\u2032 will themselves satisfy the conditions\nE(1 \u2212 E) = 0, E\u2032(1 \u2212 E\u2032) = 0. (2)\nNow (1) gives\nt = E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E ,\nthe second member of which is to be expanded as a function of the remaining\nsymbols. It is evident that the only numerical values which E and E\u2032 can receive\nin the calculation of the coefficients will be 1 and 0. The following cases alone\ncan therefore arise:\n1st. E\u2032 = 1, E = 1, then E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E = 1\n0 .\n2nd. E\u2032 = 1, E = 0, then E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E = 1.\n3rd. E\u2032 = 0, E = 1, then E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E = 0.\n4th. E\u2032 = 0, E = 0, then E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E = 0\n0 .\nWhence the truth of the Proposition is manifest.\n6. It may be remarked that the forms 1, 0, and 0\n0 appear in the solution of\nequations independently of any reference to the condition V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0. But it\nis not so with the coefficient 1\n0 . The terms to which this coefficient is attached\nwhen the above condition is satisfied may receive any other value except the\nthree values 1, 0, and 0\n0 , when that condition is not satisfied. It is permitted,\nand it would conduce to uniformity, to change any coefficient of a development\nnot presenting itself in any of the four forms referred to in this Proposition into\n1\n0 , regarding this as the symbol proper to indicate that the coefficient to which\nit is attached should be equated to 0. This course I shall frequently adopt.\nProposition III.\nCHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 122\n7. The result of the elimination of any symbols x, y, &c. from an equation\nV = 0, of which the first member identically satisfies the law of duality,\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0,\nmay be obtained by developing the given equation with reference to the other\nsymbols, and equating to 0 the sum of those constituents whose coefficients in\nthe expansion are equal to unity.\nSuppose that the given equation V = 0 involves but three symbols, x, y, and\nt, of which x and y are to be eliminated. Let the development of the equation,\nwith respect to t, be\nAt + B(1 \u2212 t) = 0, (1)\nA and B being free from the symbol t.\nBy Chap. IX. Prop. 3, the result of the elimination of x and y from the\ngiven equation will be of the form\nEt + E\u2032(1 \u2212 t) = 0, (2)\nin which E is the result obtained by eliminating the symbols x and y from the\nequation A = 0, E\u2032 the result obtained by eliminating from the equation B = 0.\nNow A and B must satisfy the condition\nA(1 \u2212 A) = 0, B(1 \u2212 B) = 0\nHence A (confining ourselves for the present to this coefficient) will either\nbe 0 or 1, or a constituent, or the sum of a part of the constituents which\ninvolve the symbols x and y. If A = 0 it is evident that E = 0; if A is a single\nconstituent, or the sum of a part of the constituents involving x and y, E will\nbe 0. For the full development of A, with respect to x and y, will contain terms\nwith vanishing coefficients, and E is the product of all the coefficients. Hence\nwhen A = 1, E is equal to A, but in other cases E is equal to 0. Similarly, when\nB = 1, E is equal to B, but in other cases E vanishes. Hence the expression (2)\nwill consist of that part, if any there be, of (1) in which the coefficients A, B\nare unity. And this reasoning is general. Suppose, for instance, that V involved\nthe symbols x, y, z, t, and that it were required to eliminate x and y. Then if\nthe development of V , with reference to z and t, were\nzt + xz(1 \u2212 t) + y(1 \u2212 z)t + (1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 t),\nthe result sought would be\nzt + (1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 t) = 0,\nthis being that portion of the development of which the coefficients are unity.\nHence, if from any system of equations we deduce a single equivalent equation\nV = 0, V satisfying the condition\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0,\nCHAPTER X. CONDITIONS OF A PERFECT METHOD 123\nthe ordinary processes of elimination may be entirely dispensed with, and\nthe single process of development made to supply their place.\n8. It may be that there is no practical advantage in the method thus\npointed out, but it possesses a theoretical unity and completeness which render\nit deserving of regard, and I shall accordingly devote a future chapter (XIV.)\nto its illustration. The progress of applied mathematics has presented other\nand signal examples of the reduction of systems of problems or equations to the\ndominion of some central but pervading law.\n9. It is seen from what precedes that there is one class of propositions\nto which all the special appliances of the above methods of preparation are\nunnecessary. It is that which is characterized by the following conditions:\nFirst, That the propositions are of the ordinary kind, implied by the use of\nthe copula is or are, the predicates being particular.\nSecondly, That the terms of the proposition are intelligible without the\nsupposition of any understood relation among the elements which enter into\nthe expression of those terms.\nThirdly, That the propositions are independent.\nWe may, if such speculation is not altogether vain, permit ourselves\nto conjecture that these are the conditions which would be obeyed in the\nemployment of language as an instrument of expression and of thought, by\nunerring beings, declaring simply what they mean, without suppression on\nthe one hand, and without repetition on the other. Considered both in their\nrelation to the idea of a perfect language, and in their relation to the processes\nof an exact method, these conditions are equally worthy of the attention of the\nstudent.\nChapter XI\nOF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS, AND OF THE\nPRINCIPLES OF THEIR SYMBOLICAL EXPRESSION.\n1. The doctrine has already been established in Chap. IV., that every logical\nproposition may be referred to one or the other of two great classes, viz., Primary\nPropositions and Secondary Propositions. The former of these classes has been\ndiscussed in the preceding chapters of this work, and we are now led to the\nconsideration of Secondary Propositions, i.e. of Propositions concerning, or\nrelating to, other propositions regarded as true or false. The investigation upon\nwhich we are entering will, in its general order and progress, resemble that\nwhich we have already conducted. The two inquiries differ as to the subjects\nof thought which they recognise, not as to the formal and scientific laws which\nthey reveal, or the methods or processes which are founded upon those laws.\nProbability would in some measure favour the expectation of such a result. It\nconsists with all that we know of the uniformity of Nature, and all that we\nbelieve of the immutable constancy of the Author of Nature, to suppose, that\nin the mind, which has been endowed with such high capabilities, not only\nfor converse with surrounding scenes, but for the knowledge of itself, and for\nreflection upon the laws of its own constitution, there should exist a harmony\nand uniformity not less real than that which the study of the physical sciences\nmakes known to us. Anticipations such as this are never to be made the primary\nrule of our inquiries, nor are they in any degree to divert us from those labours\nof patient research by which we ascertain what is the actual constitution of\nthings within the particular province submitted to investigation. But when the\ngrounds of resemblance have been properly and independently determined, it\nis not inconsistent, even with purely scientific ends, to make that resemblance\na subject of meditation, to trace its extent, and to receive the intimations of\ntruth, yet undiscovered, which it may seem to us to convey. The necessity of\na final appeal to fact is not thus set aside, nor is the use of analogy extended\nbeyond its proper sphere,\u2013the suggestion of relations which independent inquiry\nmust either verify or cause to be rejected.\n2. Secondary Propositions are those which concern or relate to Propositions\nconsidered as true or false. The relations of things we express by primary\npropositions. But we are able to make Propositions themselves also the subject\n124\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 125\nof thought, and to express our judgments concerning them. The expression\nof any such judgment constitutes a secondary proposition. There exists no\nproposition whatever of which a competent degree of knowledge would not\nenable us to make one or the other of these two assertions, viz., either that\nthe proposition is true, or that it is false; and each of these assertions is a\nsecondary proposition. \u201cIt is true that the sun shines;\u201d \u201cIt is not true that\nthe planets shine by their own light;\u201d are examples of this kind. In the former\nexample the Proposition \u201cThe sun shines,\u201d is asserted to be true. In the latter,\nthe Proposition, \u201cThe planets shine by their own light,\u201d is asserted to be false.\nSecondary propositions also include all judgments by which we express a relation\nor dependence among propositions. To this class or division we may refer\nconditional propositions, as, \u201cIf the sun shine the day will be fair.\u201d Also most\ndisjunctive propositions, as, \u201cEither the sun will shine, or the enterprise will\nbe postponed.\u201d In the former example we express the dependence of the truth\nof the Proposition, \u201cThe day will be fair,\u201d upon the truth of the Proposition,\n\u201cThe sun will shine.\u201d In the latter we express a relation between the two\nPropositions, \u201cThe sun will shine,\u201d \u201cThe enterprise will be postponed,\u201d implying\nthat the truth of the one excludes the truth of the other. To the same class\nof secondary propositions we must also refer all those propositions which assert\nthe simultaneous truth or falsehood of propositions, as, \u201cIt is not true both that\n\u2018the sun will shine\u2019 and that \u2018the journey will be postponed.\u2019 \u201d The elements\nof distinction which we have noticed may even be blended together in the same\nsecondary proposition. It may involve both the disjunctive element expressed by\neither, or, and the conditional element expressed by if ; in addition to which, the\nconnected propositions may themselves be of a compound character. If \u201cthe sun\nshine,\u201d and \u201cleisure permit,\u201d then either \u201cthe enterprise shall be commenced,\u201d\nor \u201csome preliminary step shall be taken.\u201d In this example a number of\npropositions are connected together, not arbitrarily and unmeaningly, but in\nsuch a manner as to express a definite connexion between them,\u2013a connexion\nhaving reference to their respective truth or falsehood. This combination,\ntherefore, according to our definition, forms a Secondary Proposition.\nThe theory of Secondary Propositions is deserving of attentive study, as well\non account of its varied applications, as for that close and harmonious analogy,\nalready referred to, which it sustains with the theory of Primary Propositions.\nUpon each of these points I desire to offer a few further observations.\n3. I would in the first place remark, that it is in the form of secondary\npropositions, at least as often as in that of primary propositions, that the\nreasonings of ordinary life are exhibited. The discourses, too, of the moralist and\nthe metaphysician are perhaps less often concerning things and their qualities,\nthan concerning principles and hypotheses, concerning truths and the mutual\nconnexion and relation of truths. The conclusions which our narrow experience\nsuggests in relation to the great questions of morals and society yet unsolved,\nmanifest, in more ways than one, the limitations of their human origin; and\nthough the existence of universal principles is not to be questioned, the partial\nformulae which comprise our knowledge of their application are subject to\nconditions, and exceptions, and failure. Thus, in those departments of inquiry\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 126\nwhich, from the nature of their subject-matter, should be the most interesting\nof all, much of our actual knowledge is hypothetical. That there has been\na strong tendency to the adoption of the same forms of thought in writers\non speculative philosophy, will hereafter appear. Hence the introduction of a\ngeneral method for the discussion of hypothetical and the other varieties of\nsecondary propositions, will open to us a more interesting field of applications\nthan we have before met with.\n4. The discussion of the theory of Secondary Propositions is in the next\nplace interesting, from the close and remarkable analogy which it bears with\nthe theory of Primary Propositions. It will appear, that the formal laws to\nwhich the operations of the mind are subject, are identical in expression in\nboth cases. The mathematical processes which are founded on those laws are,\ntherefore, identical also. Thus the methods which have been investigated in the\nformer portion of this work will continue to be available in the new applications\nto which we are about to proceed. But while the laws and processes of the\nmethod remain unchanged, the rule of interpretation must be adapted to new\nconditions. Instead of classes of things, we shall have to substitute propositions,\nand for the relations of classes and individuals, we shall have to consider the\nconnexions of propositions or of events. Still, between the two systems, however\ndiffering in purport and interpretation, there will be seen to exist a pervading\nharmonious relation, an analogy which, while it serves to facilitate the conquest\nof every yet remaining difficulty, is of itself an interesting subject of study, and\na conclusive proof of that unity of character which marks the constitution of\nthe human faculties.\nProposition I.\n5. To investigate the nature of the connexion of Secondary Propositions with\nthe idea of Time.\nIt is necessary, in entering upon this inquiry, to state clearly the nature of\nthe analogy which connects Secondary with Primary Propositions.\nPrimary Propositions express relations among things, viewed as component\nparts of a universe within the limits of which, whether coextensive with the\nlimits of the actual universe or not, the matter of our discourse is confined.\nThe relations expressed are essentially substantive. Some, or all, or none, of the\nmembers of a given class, are also members of another class. The subjects to\nwhich primary propositions refer\u2013the relations among those subjects which they\nexpress\u2013are all of the above character.\nBut in treating of secondary propositions, we find ourselves concerned with\nanother class both of subjects and relations. For the subjects with which we have\nto do are themselves propositions, so that the question may be asked,\u2013Can we\nregard these subjects also as things, and refer them, by analogy with the previous\ncase, to a universe of their own? Again, the relations among these subject\npropositions are relations of coexistent truth or falsehood, not of substantive\nequivalence. We do not say, when expressing the connexion of two distinct\npropositions, that the one is the other, but use some such forms of speech as\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 127\nthe following, according to the meaning which we desire to convey: \u201cEither the\nproposition X is true, or the proposition Y is true;\u201d \u201cIf the proposition X is\ntrue, the proposition Y is true;\u201d \u201cThe propositions X and Y are jointly true;\u201d\nand so on.\nNow, in considering any such relations as the above, we are not called upon\nto inquire into the whole extent of their possible meaning (for this might involve\nus in metaphysical questions of causation, which are beyond the proper limits\nof science); but it suffices to ascertain some meaning which they undoubtedly\npossess, and which is adequate for the purposes of logical deduction. Let us take,\nas an instance for examination, the conditional proposition, \u201cIf the proposition\nX is true, the proposition Y is true.\u201d An undoubted meaning of this proposition\nis, that the time in which the proposition X is true, is time in which the\nproposition Y is true. This indeed is only a relation of coexistence, and may\nor may not exhaust the meaning of the proposition, but it is a relation really\ninvolved in the statement of the proposition, and further, it suffices for all the\npurposes of logical inference.\nThe language of common life sanctions this view of the essential connexion of\nsecondary propositions with the notion of time. Thus we limit the application of\na primary proposition by the word \u201csome,\u201d but that of a secondary proposition\nby the word \u201csometimes.\u201d To say, \u201cSometimes injustice triumphs,\u201d is equivalent\nto asserting that there are times in which the proposition \u201cInjustice now\ntriumphs,\u201d is a true proposition. There are indeed propositions, the truth of\nwhich is not thus limited to particular periods or conjunctures; propositions\nwhich are true throughout all time, and have received the appellation of \u201ceternal\ntruths.\u201d The distinction must be familiar to every reader of Plato and Aristotle,\nby the latter of whom, especially, it is employed to denote the contrast between\nthe abstract verities of science, such as the propositions of geometry which are\nalways true, and those contingent or ph\u00e6nomenal relations of things which are\nsometimes true and sometimes false. But the forms of language in which both\nkinds of propositions are expressed manifest a common dependence upon the\nidea of time; in the one case as limited to some finite duration, in the other as\nstretched out to eternity.\n6. It may indeed be said, that in ordinary reasoning we are often quite\nunconscious of this notion of time involved in the very language we are using.\nBut the remark, however just, only serves to show that we commonly reason by\nthe aid of words and the forms of a well-constructed language, without attending\nto the ulterior grounds upon which those very forms have been established. The\ncourse of the present investigation will afford an illustration of the very same\nprinciple. I shall avail myself of the notion of time in order to determine the laws\nof the expression of secondary propositions, as well as the laws of combination\nof the symbols by which they are expressed. But when those laws and those\nforms are once determined, this notion of time (essential, as I believe it to be,\nto the above end) may practically be dispensed with. We may then pass from\nthe forms of common language to the closely analogous forms of the symbolical\ninstrument of thought here developed, and use its processes, and interpret its\nresults, without any conscious recognition of the idea of time whatever.\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 128\nProposition II.\n7. To establish a system of notation for the expression of Secondary\nPropositions, and to show that the symbols which it involves are subject to\nthe same laws of combination as the corresponding symbols employed in the\nexpression of Primary Propositions.\nLet us employ the capital letters X, Y , Z, to denote the elementary\npropositions concerning which we desire to make some assertion touching their\ntruth or falsehood, or among which we seek to express some relation in the\nform of a secondary proposition. And let us employ the corresponding small\nletters x, y, z, considered as expressive of mental operations, in the following\nsense, viz.: Let x represent an act of the mind by which we fix our regard\nupon that portion of time for which the proposition X is true; and let this\nmeaning be understood when it is asserted that x denotes the time for which\nthe proposition X is true. Let us further employ the connecting signs +, -,\n=, &c., in the following sense, viz.: Let x + y denote the aggregate of those\nportions of time for which the propositions X and Y are respectively true, those\ntimes being entirely separated from each other. Similarly let x \u2212 y denote that\nremainder of time which is left when we take away from the portion of time for\nwhich X is true, that (by supposition) included portion for which Y is true.\nAlso, let x = y denote that the time for which the proposition X is true, is\nidentical with the time for which the proposition Y is true. We shall term x;\nthe representative symbol of the proposition X, &c.\nFrom the above definitions it will follow, that we shall always have\nx + y = y + x,\nfor either member will denote the same aggregate of time.\nLet us further represent by xy the performance in succession of the two\noperations represented by y and x, i.e. the whole mental operation which\nconsists of the following elements, viz., 1st, The mental selection of that portion\nof time for which the proposition Y is true. 2ndly, The mental selection, out\nof that portion of time, of such portion as it contains of the time in which the\nproposition X is true,\u2013the result of these successive processes being the fixing\nof the mental regard upon the whole of that portion of time for which the\npropositions X and Y are both true.\nFrom this definition it will follow, that we shall always have\nxy = yx. (1)\nFor whether we select mentally, first that portion of time for which the\nproposition Y is true, then out of the result that contained portion for which X\nis true; or first, that portion of time for which the proposition X is true, then\nout of the result that contained portion of it for which the proposition Y is true;\nwe shall arrive at the same final result, viz., that portion of time for which the\npropositions X and Y are both true.\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 129\nBy continuing this method of reasoning it may be established, that the laws\nof combination of the symbols x, y, z, &c., in the species of interpretation here\nassigned to them, are identical in expression with the laws of combination of\nthe same symbols, in the interpretation assigned to them in the first part of this\ntreatise. The reason of this final identity is apparent. For in both cases it is\nthe same faculty, or the same combination of faculties, of which we study the\noperations; operations, the essential character of which is unaffected, whether we\nsuppose them to be engaged upon that universe of things in which all existence\nis contained, or upon that whole of time in which all events are realized, and to\nsome part, at least, of which all assertions, truths, and propositions, refer.\nThus, in addition to the laws above stated, we shall have by (4), Chap, II.,\nthe law whose expression is\nx(y + z) = xy + xz; (2)\nand more particularly the fundamental law of duality (2) Chap, II., whose\nexpression is\nx2 = x, or, x(1 \u2212 x) = 0; (3)\na law, which while it serves to distinguish the system of thought in Logic\nfrom the system of thought in the science of quantity, gives to the processes\nof the former a completeness and a generality which they could not otherwise\npossess.\n8. Again, as this law (3) (as well as the other laws) is satisfied by the\nsymbols 0 and 1, we are led, as before, to inquire whether those symbols do not\nadmit of interpretation in the present system of thought. The same course of\nreasoning which we before pursued shows that they do, and warrants us in the\ntwo following positions, viz.:\n1st, That in the expression of secondary propositions, 0 represents nothing\nin reference to the element of time.\n2nd, That in the same system 1 represents the universe, or whole of time,\nto which the discourse is supposed in any manner to relate.\nAs in primary propositions the universe of discourse is sometimes limited to\na small portion of the actual universe of things, and is sometimes co-extensive\nwith that universe; so in secondary propositions, the universe of discourse may\nbe limited to a single day or to the passing moment, or it may comprise the whole\nduration of time. It may, in the most literal sense, be \u201ceternal.\u201d Indeed, unless\nthere is some limitation expressed or implied in the nature of the discourse, the\nproper interpretation of the symbol 1 in secondary propositions is \u201ceternity;\u201d\neven as its proper interpretation in the primary system is the actually existent\nuniverse.\n9. Instead of appropriating the symbols x, y, z, to the representation of the\ntruths of propositions, we might with equal propriety apply them to represent\nthe occurrence of events. In fact, the occurrence of an event both implies,\nand is implied by, the truth of a proposition, viz., of the proposition which\nasserts the occurrence of the event. The one signification of the symbol x\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 130\nnecessarily involves the other. It will greatly conduce to convenience to be able\nto employ our symbols in either of these really equivalent interpretations which\nthe circumstances of a problem may suggest to us as most desirable; and of this\nliberty I shall avail myself whenever occasion requires. In problems of pure Logic\nI shall consider the symbols x, y, &c. as representing elementary propositions,\namong which relation is expressed in the premises. In the mathematical theory\nof probabilities, which, as before intimated (I. 12), rests upon a basis of Logic,\nand which it is designed to treat in a subsequent portion of this work, I shall\nemploy the same symbols to denote the simple events, whose implied or required\nfrequency of occurrence it counts among its elements.\nProposition III.\n10. To deduce general Rules for the expression of Secondary Propositions.\nIn the various inquiries arising out of this Proposition, fulness of demonstration\nwill be the less necessary, because of the exact analogy which they bear with\nsimilar inquiries already completed with reference to primary propositions. We\nshall first consider the expression of terms; secondly, that of the propositions\nby which they are connected.\nAs 1 denotes the whole duration of time, and x that portion of it for which\nthe proposition X is true, 1 \u2212 x will denote that portion of time for which the\nproposition X is false.\nAgain, as xy denotes that portion of time for which the propositions X and\nY are both true, we shall, by combining this and the previous observation, be\nled to the following interpretations, viz.:\nThe expression x(1 \u2212 y) will represent the time during which the proposition\nX is true, and the proposition Y false. The expression (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) will\nrepresent the time during which the propositions X and Y are simultaneously\nfalse.\nThe expression x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) will express the time during which either\nX is true or Y true, but not both; for that time is the sum of the times in which\nthey are singly and exclusively true. The expression xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) will\nexpress the time during which X and Y are either both true or both false.\nIf another symbol z presents itself, the same principles remain applicable.\nThus xyz denotes the time in which the propositions X, Y , and Z are\nsimultaneously true; (1\u2212x)(1\u2212y)(1\u2212z) the time in which they are simultaneously\nfalse; and the sum of these expressions would denote the time in which they are\neither true or false together.\nThe general principles of interpretation involved in the above examples do\nnot need any further illustrations or more explicit statement.\n11. The laws of the expression of propositions may now be exhibited and\nstudied in the distinct cases in which they present themselves. There is, however,\none principle of fundamental importance to which I wish in the first place to\ndirect attention. Although the principles of expression which have been laid\ndown are perfectly general, and enable us to limit our assertions of the truth\nor falsehood of propositions to any particular portions of that whole of time\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 131\n(whether it be an unlimited eternity, or a period whose beginning and whose\nend are definitely fixed, or the passing moment) which constitutes the universe of\nour discourse, yet, in the actual procedure of human reasoning, such limitation\nis not commonly employed. When we assert that a proposition is true, we\ngenerally mean that it is true throughout the whole duration of the time to\nwhich our discourse refers; and when different assertions of the unconditional\ntruth or falsehood of propositions are jointly made as the premises of a logical\ndemonstration, it is to the same universe of time that those assertions are\nreferred, and not to particular and limited parts of it. In that necessary matter\nwhich is the object or field of the exact sciences every assertion of a truth may be\nthe assertion of an \u201ceternal truth.\u201d In reasoning upon transient ph\u00e6nomena (as\nof some social conjuncture) each assertion may be qualified by an immediate\nreference to the present time, \u201cNow.\u201d But in both cases, unless there is a\ndistinct expression to the contrary, it is to the same period of duration that each\nseparate proposition relates. The cases which then arise for our consideration\nare the following:\n1st. To express the Proposition, \u201cThe proposition X is true.\u201d\nWe are here required to express that within those limits of time to which\nthe matter of our discourse is confined the proposition X is true. Now the time\nfor which the proposition X is true is denoted by x, and the extent of time to\nwhich our discourse refers is represented by 1. Hence we have\nx = 1 (4)\nas the expression required.\n2nd. To express the Proposition, \u201cThe proposition X is false.\u201d\nWe are here to express that within the limits of time to which our discourse\nrelates, the proposition X is false; or that within those limits there is no portion\nof time for which it is true. Now the portion of time for which it is true is x.\nHence the required equation will be\nx = 0. (5)\nThis result might also be obtained by equating to the whole duration of time\n1, the expression for the time during which the proposition X is false, viz., 1\u2212x.\nThis gives\n1 \u2212 x = 1,\nwhence x = 0.\n3rd. To express the disjunctive Proposition, \u201cEither the proposition X is true\nor the proposition Y is true;\u201d it being thereby implied that the said propositions\nare mutually exclusive, that is to say, that one only of them is true.\nThe time for which either the proposition X is true or the proposition Y is\ntrue, but not both, is represented by the expression x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x). Hence\nwe have\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 132\nx(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = 1, (6)\nfor the equation required.\nIf in the above Proposition the particles either, or, are supposed not\nto possess an absolutely disjunctive power, so that the possibility of the\nsimultaneous truth of the propositions X and Y is not excluded, we must\nadd to the first member of the above equations the term xy. We shall thus have\nxy + x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y = 1,\nor x + (1 \u2212 x)y = 1. (7)\n4th. To express the conditional Proposition, \u201cIf the proposition Y is true,\nthe proposition X is true.\u201d\nSince whenever the proposition Y is true, the proposition X is true, it is\nnecessary and sufficient here to express, that the time in which the proposition\nY is true is time in which the proposition X is true; that is to say, that it is\nsome indefinite portion of the whole time in which the proposition X is true.\nNow the time in which the proposition Y is true is y, and the whole time in\nwhich the proposition X is true is x. Let v be a symbol of time indefinite, then\nwill vx represent an indefinite portion of the whole time x. Accordingly, we\nshall have\ny = vx\nas the expression of the proposition given.\n12. When v is thus regarded as a symbol of time indefinite, vx may be\nunderstood to represent the whole, or an indefinite part, or no part, of the\nwhole time x; for any one of these meanings may be realized by a particular\ndetermination of the arbitrary symbol v. Thus, if v be determined to represent\na time in which the whole time x is included, vx will represent the whole time\nx. If v be determined to represent a time, some part of which is included in the\ntime x, but which does not fill up the measure of that time, vx will represent a\npart of the time x. If, lastly, v is determined to represent a time, of which no\npart is common with any part of the time x, vx will assume the value 0, and\nwill be equivalent to \u201cno time,\u201d or \u201cnever.\u201d\nNow it is to be observed that the proposition, \u201cIf Y is true, X is true,\u201d\ncontains no assertion of the truth of either of the propositions X and Y . It\nmay equally consist with the supposition that the truth of the proposition Y is\na condition indispensable to the truth of the proposition X, in which case we\nshall have v = 1; or with the supposition that although Y expresses a condition\nwhich, when realized, assures us of the truth of X, yet X may be true without\nimplying the fulfilment of that condition, in which case v denotes a time, some\npart of which is contained in the whole time x; or, lastly, with the supposition\nthat the proposition Y is not true at all, in which case v represents some time,\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 133\nno part of which is common with any part of the time x. All these cases are\ninvolved in the general supposition that v is a symbol of time indefinite.\n5th. To express a proposition in which the conditional and the disjunctive\ncharacters both exist.\nThe general form of a conditional proposition is, \u201cIf Y is true, X is true,\u201d\nand its expression is, by the last section, y = vx. We may properly, in analogy\nwith the usage which has been established in primary propositions, designate\nY and X as the terms of the conditional proposition into which they enter; and\nwe may further adopt the language of the ordinary Logic, which designates the\nterm Y , to which the particle if is attached, the \u201cantecedent\u201d of the proposition,\nand the term X the \u201cconsequent.\u201d\nNow instead of the terms, as in the above case, being simple propositions,\nlet each or either of them be a disjunctive proposition involving different terms\nconnected by the particles either, or, as in the following illustrative examples,\nin which X, Y , Z, &c. denote simple propositions.\n1st. If either X is true or Y is true, then Z is true.\n2nd. If X is true, then either Y is true or Z true.\n3rd. If either X is true or Y is true, then either Z and W are both true, or\nthey are both false.\nIt is evident that in the above cases the relation of the antecedent to the\nconsequent is not affected by the circumstance that one of those terms or both\nare of a disjunctive character. Accordingly it is only necessary to obtain, in\nconformity with the principles already established, the proper expressions for\nthe antecedent and the consequent, to affect the latter with the indefinite symbol\nv, and to equate the results. Thus for the propositions above stated we shall\nhave the respective equations,\n1st x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y = vz.\n2nd.x = v{y(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 y)}.\n3rd.x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = v{zw + (1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 w)}\nThe rule here exemplified is of general application.\nCases in which the disjunctive and the conditional elements enter in a manner\ndifferent from the above into the expression of a compound proposition, are\nconceivable, but I am not aware that they are ever presented to us by the natural\nexigencies of human reason, and I shall therefore refrain from any discussion of\nthem. No serious difficulty will arise from this omission, as the general principles\nwhich have formed the basis of the above applications are perfectly general, and\na slight effort of thought will adapt them to any imaginable case.\n13. In the laws of expression above stated those of interpretation are\nimplicitly involved. The equation\nx = 1\nmust be understood to express that the proposition X is true; the equation\nx = 0,\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 134\nthat the proposition X is false. The equation\nxy = 1\nwill express that the propositions X and Y are both true together; and the\nequation\nxy = 0\nthat they are not both together true.\nIn like manner the equations\nx(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = 1,\nx(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nwill respectively assert the truth and the falsehood of the disjunctive\nProposition, \u201cEither X is true or Y is true.\u201d The equations\ny = vx\ny = v(1 \u2212 x)\nwill respectively express the Propositions, \u201cIf the proposition Y is true, the\nproposition X is true.\u201d \u201cIf the proposition Y is true, the proposition X is false.\u201d\nExamples will frequently present themselves, in the succeeding chapters of\nthis work, of a case in which some terms of a particular member of an equation\nare affected by the indefinite symbol v, and others not so affected. The following\ninstance will serve for illustration. Suppose that we have\ny = xz + vx(1 \u2212 z).\nHere it is implied that the time for which the proposition Y is true consists\nof all the time for which X and Z are together true, together with an indefinite\nportion of the time for which X is true and Z false. From this it may be seen,\n1st, That if Y is true, either X and Z are together true, or X is true and Z\nfalse; 2ndly, If X and Z are together true, Y is true. The latter of these may\nbe called the reverse interpretation, and it consists in taking the antecedent\nout of the second member, and the consequent from the first member of the\nequation. The existence of a term in the second member, whose coefficient is\nunity, renders this latter mode of interpretation possible. The general principle\nwhich it involves may be thus stated:\n14. Principle.\u2013Any constituent term or terms in a particular member of an\nequation which have for their coefficient unity, may be taken as the antecedent of\na proposition, of which all the terms in the other member form the consequent.\nThus the equation\ny = xz + vx(1 \u2212 z) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z)\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 135\nwould have the following interpretations:\nDirect Interpretation.\u2013If the proposition Y is true, then either X and\nZ are true, or X is true and Z false, or X and Z are both false.\nReverse Interpretation.\u2013If either X and Z are true, or X and Z are\nfalse, Y is true.\nThe aggregate of these partial interpretations will express the whole\nsignificance of the equation given.\n15. We may here call attention again to the remark, that although the idea\nof time appears to be an essential element in the theory of the interpretation\nof secondary propositions, it may practically be neglected as soon as the laws\nof expression and of interpretation are definitely established. The forms to\nwhich those laws give rise seem, indeed, to correspond with the forms of a\nperfect language. Let us imagine any known or existing language freed from\nidioms and divested of superfluity, and let us express in that language any given\nproposition in a manner the most simple and literal,\u2013the most in accordance\nwith those principles of pure and universal thought upon which all languages\nare founded, of which all bear the manifestation, but from which all have more\nor less departed. The transition from such a language to the notation of analysis\nwould consist of no more than the substitution of one set of signs for another,\nwithout essential change either of form or character. For the elements, whether\nthings or propositions, among which relation is expressed, we should substitute\nletters; for the disjunctive conjunction we should write +; for the connecting\ncopula or sign of relatioin, we should write =. This analogy I need not pursue.\nIts reality and completeness will be made more apparent from the study of those\nforms of expression which will present themselves in subsequent applications of\nthe present theory, viewed in more immediate comparison with that imperfect\nyet noble instrument of thought\u2013the English language.\n16. Upon the general analogy between the theory of Primary and that of\nSecondary Propositions, I am desirous of adding a few remarks before dismissing\nthe subject of the present chapter.\nWe might undoubtedly, have established the theory of Primary Propositions\nupon the simple notion of space, in the same way as that of secondary\npropositions has been established upon the notion of time. Perhaps, had\nthis been done, the analogy which we are contemplating would have been\nin somewhat closer accordance with the view of those who regard space and\ntime as merely \u201cforms of the human understanding,\u201d conditions of knowledge\nimposed by the very constitution of the mind upon all that is submitted to\nits apprehension. But this view, while on the one hand it is incapable of\ndemonstration, on the other hand ties us down to the recognition of \u201cplace,\u201d\n\u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03bf\u1fce\u03bd, as an essential category of existence. The question, indeed, whether it\nis so or not, lies, I apprehend, beyond the reach of our faculties; but it may be,\nand I conceive has been, established, that the formal processes of reasoning in\nprimary propositions do not require, as an essential condition, the manifestation\nin space of the things about which we reason; that they would remain applicable,\nwith equal strictness of demonstration, to forms of existence, if such there be,\nwhich lie beyond the realm of sensible extension. It is a fact, perhaps, in some\nCHAPTER XI. OF SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 136\ndegree analogous to this, that we are able in many known examples in geometry\nand dynamics, to exhibit the formal analysis of problems founded upon some\nintellectual conception of space different from that which is presented to us by\nthe senses, or which can be realized by the imagination. 1 I conceive, therefore,\nthat the idea of space is not essential to the development of a theory of primary\npropositions, but am disposed, though desiring to speak with diffidence upon\na question of such extreme difficulty, to think that the idea of time is essential\nto the establishment of a theory of secondary propositions. There seem to\nbe grounds for thinking, that without any change in those faculties which are\nconcerned in reasoning, the manifestation of space to the human mind might\nhave been different from what it is, but not (at least the same) grounds for\nsupposing that the manifestation of time could have been otherwise than we\nperceive it to be. Dismissing, however, these speculations as possibly not\naltogether free from presumption, let it be affirmed that the real ground upon\nwhich the symbol 1 represents in primary propositions the universe of things,\nand not the space they occupy, is, that the sign of identity = connecting the\nmembers of the corresponding equations, implies that the things which they\nrepresent are identical, not simply that they are found in the same portion of\nspace. Let it in like manner be affirmed, that the reason why the symbol 1 in\nsecondary propositions represents, not the universe of events, but the eternity\nin whose successive moments and periods they are evolved, is, that the same\nsign of identity connecting the logical members of the corresponding equations\nimplies, not that the events which those members represent are identical, but\nthat the times of their occurrence are the same. These reasons appear to me\nto be decisive of the immediate question of interpretation. In a former treatise\non this subject (Mathematical Analysis of Logic, p. 49), following the theory\nof Wallis respecting the Reduction of Hypothetical Propositions, I was led to\ninterpret the symbol 1 in secondary propositions as the universe of \u201ccases\u201d\nor \u201cconjunctures of circumstances;\u201d but this view involves the necessity of a\ndefinition of what is meant by a \u201ccase,\u201d or \u201cconjuncture of circumstances;\u201d and\nit is certain, that whatever is involved in the term beyond the notion of time is\nalien to the objects, and restrictive of the processes, of formal Logic.\n1Space is presented to us in perception, as possessing the three dimensions of length,\nbreadth, and depth. But in a large class of problems relating to the properties of curved\nsurfaces, the rotations of solid bodies around axes, the vibrations of elastic media, &c.,\nthis limitation appears in the analytical investigation to be of an arbitrary character, and\nif attention were paid to the processes of solution alone, no reason could be discovered why\nspace should not exist in four or in any greater number of dimensions. The intellectual\nprocedure in the imaginary world thus suggested can be apprehended by the clearest light of\nanalogy.\nThe existence of space in three dimensions, and the views thereupon of the religious and\nphilosophical mind of antiquity, are thus set forth by Aristotle:\u2013 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ad\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f72\u03c6 \u00a8\u03b5\u03bd,\n\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ae \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u0384 \u03ad\u03c0\u1f76 \u03b4\u0384\u03bd\u03bf \u03ad\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u0384 \u1f72\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3v\u1f65\u03bc\u03b1\u0384 \u039a\u03b1\u03af \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bf\u0384\u03bd\u03ba \u00a8\u03b5\u03c3v\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u00a8\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2,\n\u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b5\u1f76\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03c1\u1f76\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7. \u039a\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1 \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3v\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f76 \u03a0\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u1f04\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\n\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f34\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3v\u1f76\u03bd \u00a8\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3v\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. \u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u1f74 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3v\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f70\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u00a8\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fce\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2\u0384\n\u03c4\u03b1\u1fce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u1f24\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2. \u0394\u03b9\u1f78 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f24\u03c2 \u03c6\u0384\u03bd\u03c3v\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c6\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u00a8\u03c9\u03c3v\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03c2 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2\n\u1f70\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3v\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f64\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1f64\u03bd \u03c4\u1fce\u03c8 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u1fce\u03c8 \u03c4\u03bf\u0384\u03bd\u03c4\u1fce\u03c8.\u2013De Caelo, 1.\nChapter XII\nOF THE METHODS AND PROCESSES TO BE\nADOPTED IN THE TREATMENT OF SECONDARY\nPROPOSITIONS.\n1. It has appeared from previous researches (XI. 7) that the laws of combination\nof the literal symbols of Logic are the same, whether those symbols are employed\nin the expression of primary or in that of secondary propositions, the sole\nexisting difference between the two cases being a difference of interpretation.\nIt has also been established (V. 6), that whenever distinct systems of thought\nand interpretation are connected with the same system of formal laws, i.e., of\nlaws relating to the combination and use of symbols, the attendant processes,\nintermediate between the expression of the primary conditions of a problem and\nthe interpretation of its symbolical solution, are the same in both. Hence, as\nbetween the systems of thought manifested in the two forms of primary and\nof secondary propositions, this community of formal law exists, the processes\nwhich have been established and illustrated in our discussion of the former class\nof propositions will, without any modification, be applicable to the latter.\n2. Thus the laws of the two fundamental processes of elimination and\ndevelopment are the same in the system of secondary as in the system of primary\npropositions. Again, it has been seen (Chap. VI. Prop. 2) how, in primary\npropositions, the interpretation of any proposed equation devoid of fractional\nforms may be effected by developing it into a series of constituents, and equating\nto 0 every constituent whose coefficient does not vanish. To the equations of\nsecondary propositions the same method is applicable, and the interpreted result\nto which it finally conducts us is, as in the former case (VI. 6), a system of co-\nexistent denials. But while in the former case the force of those denials is\nexpended upon the existence of certain classes of things, in the latter it relates\nto the truth of certain combinations of the elementary propositions involved in\nthe terms of the given premises. And as in primary propositions it was seen\nthat the system of denials admitted of conversion into various other forms of\npropositions (VI. 7), &c., such conversion will be found to be possible here also,\nthe sole difference consisting not in the forms of the equations, but in the nature\nof their interpretation.\n3. Moreover, as in primary propositions, we can find the expression of any\n137\nCHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 138\nelement entering into a system of equations, in terms of the remaining elements\n(VI. 10), or of any selected number of the remaining elements, and interpret\nthat expression into a logical inference, the same object can be accomplished\nby the same means, difference of interpretation alone excepted, in the system of\nsecondary propositions. The elimination of those elements which we desire to\nbanish from the final solution, the reduction of the system to a single equation,\nthe algebraic solution and the mode of its development into an interpretable\nform, differ in no respect from the corresponding steps in the discussion of\nprimary propositions.\nTo remove, however, any possible difficulty, it may be desirable to collect\nunder a general Rule the different cases which present themselves in the\ntreatment of secondary propositions.\nRule.\u2013Express symbolically the given propositions (XI. 11).\nEliminate separately from each equation in which it is found the indefinite\nsymbol v (VII. 5).\nEliminate the remaining symbols which it is desired to banish from the final\nsolution: always before elimination \u2019reducing to a single equation those equations\nin which the symbol or symbols to be eliminated are found (VIII. 7). Collect the\nresulting equations into a single equation V = 0.\nThen proceed according to the particular form in which it is desired to express\nthe final relation, as\u2013\n1st. If in the form of a denial, or system of denials, develop the function V ,\nand equate to 0 all those constituents whose coefficients do not vanish.\n2ndly. If in the form of a disjunctive proposition, equate to 1 the sum of\nthose constituents whose coefficients vanish.\n3rdly. If in the form of a conditional proposition having a simple element, as\nx or 1\u2212x, for its antecedent, determine the algebraic expression of that element,\nand develop that expression.\n4thly. If in the form of a conditional proposition having a compound\nexpression, as xy, xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y), &c., for its antecedent, equate that\nexpression to a new symbol t, and determine t as a developed function of the\nsymbols which are to appear in the consequent, either by ordinary methods or\nby the special method (IX. 9).\n5thly. Interpret the results by (XI. 13, 14).\nIf it only be desired to ascertain whether a particular elementary proposition\nx is true or false, we must eliminate all the symbols but x; then the equation\nx = 1 will indicate that the proposition is true, x = 0 that it is false, 0 = 0 that\nthe premises are insufficient to determine whether it is true or false.\n4. Ex. 1.\u2013The following prediction is made the subject of a curious discussion\nin Cicero\u2019s fragmentary treatise, De Fato:\u2013\u201cSi quis (Fabius) natus est oriente\nCanicula, is in mari non morietur.\u201d I shall apply to it the method of this chapter.\nLet y represent the proposition, \u201cFabius was born at the rising of the dogstar;\u201d\nx the proposition, \u201cFabius will die in the sea.\u201d In saying that x represents the\nproposition, \u201cFabius, &c.,\u201d it is only meant that x is a symbol so appropriated\n(XI. 7) to the above proposition, that the equation x = 1 declares, and the\nequation x = 0 denies, the truth of that proposition. The equation we have to\nCHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 139\ndiscuss will be\ny = v(1 \u2212 x). (1)\nAnd, first, let it be required to reduce the given proposition to a negation or\nsystem of negations (XII. 3). We have, on transposition,\ny \u2212 v(1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nEliminating v,\ny {y \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)} = 0,\nor, y \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nor, yx = 0. (2)\nThe interpretation of this result is:\u2013\u201cIt is not true that Fabius was born at\nthe rising of the dogstar, and will die in the sea.\u201d Cicero terms this form of\nproposition, \u201cConjunctio ex repugnantibus;\u201d and he remarks that Chrysippus\nthought in this way to evade the difficulty which he imagined to exist in\ncontingent assertions respecting the future: \u201cHoc loco Chrysippus aestuans falli\nsperat Chaldaeos casterosque divinos, neque eos usuros esse conjunctionibus\nut ita sua percepta pronuntient: Si quis natus est oriente Canicula is in mari\nnon morietur; sed potius ita dicant: Non et natus est quis oriente Canicul\u02c6a, et\nin mari morietur. O licentiam jocularem! ... Multa genera sunt enuntiandi,\nnec ullum distortius quam hoc quo Chrysippus sperat Chaldaeos contentos\nStoicorum causa fore.\u201d\u2013Cic. De Fato, 7, 8.\n5. To reduce the given proposition to a disjunctive form. The constituents\nnot entering into the first member of (2) are\nx(1 \u2212 y), (1 \u2212 x)y, (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y).\nWhence we have\ny(1 \u2212 x) + x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 1. (3)\nThe interpretation of which is:\u2013Either Fabius was born at the rising of the\ndogstar, and will not perish in the sea; or he was not born at the rising of\nthe dogstar, and will perish in the sea; or he was not born at the rising of the\ndogstar, and will not perish in the sea.\nIn cases like the above, however, in which there exist constituents differing\nfrom each other only by a single factor, it is, as we have seen (VII. 15), most\nconvenient to collect such constituents into a single term. If we thus connect\nthe first and third terms of (3), we have\n(1 \u2212 y)x + 1 \u2212 x = 1;\nand if we similarly connect the second and third, we have\ny(1 \u2212 x) + 1 \u2212 y = 1.\nCHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 140\nThese forms of the equation severally give the interpretations\u2013\nEither Fabius was not born under the day star, and will die in the sea, or he\nwill not die in the sea.\nEither Fabius was born under the day star, and will not die in the sea, or he\nwas not born under the dogstar.\nIt is evident that these interpretations are strictly equivalent to the former\none.\nLet us ascertain, in the form of a conditional proposition, the consequences\nwhich flow from the hypothesis, that \u201cFabius will perish in the sea.\u201d\nIn the equation (2), which expresses the result of the elimination of v from\nthe original equation, we must seek to determine x as a function of y.\nWe have\nx = 0\ny = 0y + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y) on expansion,\nor\nx = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y);\nthe interpretation of which is,\u2013If Fabius shall die in the sea, he was not born at\nthe rising of the dogstar.\nThese examples serve in some measure to illustrate the connexion which\nhas been established in the previous sections between primary and secondary\npropositions, a connexion of which the two distinguishing features are identity\nof process and analogy of interpretation.\n6. Ex. 2.\u2013There is a remarkable argument in the second book of the Republic\nof Plato, the design of which is to prove the immutability of the Divine Nature.\nIt is a very fine example both of the careful induction from familiar instances by\nwhich Plato arrives at general principles, and of the clear and connected logic\nby which he deduces from them the particular inferences which it is his object\nto establish. The argument is contained in the following dialogue:\n\u201cMust not that which departs from its proper form be changed either by itself\nor by another thing? Necessarily so. Are not things which are in the best state\nleast changed and disturbed, as the body by meats and drinks, and labours,\nand every species of plant by heats and winds, and such like affections? Is not\nthe healthiest and strongest the least changed? Assuredly. And does not any\ntrouble from without least disturb and change that soul which is strongest and\nwisest? And as to all made vessels, and furnitures, and garments, according\nto the same principle, are not those which are well wrought, and in a good\ncondition, least changed by time and other accidents? Even so. And whatever\nis in a right state, either by nature or by art, or by both these, admits of the\nsmallest change from any other thing. So it seems. But God and things divine\nare in every sense in the best state. Assuredly. In this way, then, God should\nleast of all bear many forms? Least, indeed, of all. Again, should He transform\nand change Himself? Manifestly He must do so, if He is changed at all. Changes\nHe then Himself to that which is more good and fair, or to that which is worse\nand baser? Necessarily to the worse, if he be changed. For never shall we say\nthat God is indigent of beauty or of virtue. You speak most rightly, said I, and\nCHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 141\nthe matter being so, seems it to you, O Adimantus, that God or man willingly\nmakes himself in any sense worse? Impossible, said he. Impossible, then, it is,\nsaid I, that a god should wish to change himself; but ever being fairest and best,\neach of them ever remains absolutely in the same form.\u201d\nThe premises of the above argument are the following:\n1st. If the Deity suffers change, He is changed either by Himself or by\nanother.\n2nd. If He is in the best state, He is not changed by another.\n3rd. The Deity is in the best state.\n4th. If the Deity is changed by Himself, He is changed to a worse state.\n5th. If He acts willingly, He is not changed to a worse state.\n6th. The Deity acts willingly.\nLet us express the elements of these premises as follows:\nLet x represent the proposition, \u201cThe Deity suffers change.\u201d\ny, He is changed by Himself.\nz, He is changed by another.\ns, He is in the best state.\nt, He is changed to a worse state.\nw, He acts willingly.\nThen the premises expressed in symbolical language yield, after elimination\nof the indefinite class symbols v, the following equations:\nxyz + x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = 0, (1)\nsz = 0, (2)\ns = 1, (3)\ny(1 \u2212 t) = 0, (4)\nwt = 0, (5)\nw = 1. (6)\nRetaining x, I shall eliminate in succession z, s, y, t, and w (this being the\norder in which those symbols occur in the above system), and interpret the\nsuccessive results.\nEliminating z from (1) and (2), we get\nxs(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (7)\nEliminating s from (3) and (7),\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (8)\nEliminating y from (4) and (8),\nx(1 \u2212 t) = 0. (9)\nEliminating t from (5) and (9),\nxw = 0. (10)\nCHAPTER XII. METHODS IN SECONDARY PROPOSITIONS 142\nEliminating w from (6) and (10),\nx = 0. (11)\nThese equations, beginning with (8), give the following results:\nFrom (8) we have x = 0\n0 y, therefore, If the Deity suffers change, He is\nchanged by Himself.\nFrom (9), x = 0\n0 t, If the Deity suffers change, He is changed to a worse\nstate.\nFrom (10), x = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 w). If the Deity suffers change, He does not act\nwillingly.\nFrom (11), The Deity does not suffer change. This is Plato\u2019s result.\nNow I have before remarked, that the order of elimination is indifferent. Let\nus in the present case seek to verify this fact by eliminating the same symbols\nin a reverse order, beginning with w. The resulting equations are,\nt = 0, y = 0, x(1 \u2212 x) = 0, z = 0, x = 0;\nyielding the following interpretations:\nGod is not changed to a worse state. He is not changed by Himself. If He\nsuffers change, He is changed by another. He is not changed by another. He is\nnot changed.\nWe thus reach by a different route the same conclusion.\nThough as an exhibition of the power of the method, the above examples\nare of slight value, they serve as well as more complicated instances would do,\nto illustrate its nature and character.\n7. It may be remarked, as a final instance of analogy between the system of\nprimary and that of secondary propositions, that in the latter system also the\nfundamental equation,\nx(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nadmits of interpretation. It expresses the axiom, A proposition cannot at the\nsame time be true and false. Let this be compared with the corresponding\ninterpretation (III. 15). Solved under the form\nx = 0\n1 \u2212 x = 0\n0 x,\nby development, it furnishes the respective axioms: \u201cA thing is what it is:\u201d \u201cIf\na proposition is true, it is true:\u201d forms of what has been termed \u201cThe principle\nof identity.\u201d Upon the nature and the value of these axioms the most opposite\nopinions have been entertained. Some have regarded them as the very pith and\nmarrow of philosophy. Locke devoted to them a chapter, headed, \u201cOn Trifling\nPropositions.\u201d 1 In both these views there seems to have been a mixture of\ntruth and error. Regarded as supplanting experience, or as furnishing materials\nfor the vain and wordy janglings of the schools, such propositions are worse than\ntrifling. Viewed, on the other hand, as intimately allied with the very laws and\nconditions of thought, they rise into at least a speculative importance.\n1Essay on the Human Understanding, Book IV. Chap. viii.\nChapter XIII\nANALYSIS OF A PORTION OF DR. SAMUEL\nCLARKE\u2019s \u201cDEMONSTRATION OF THE BEING AND\nATTRIBUTES OF GOD,\u201d AND OF A PORTION OF\nTHE \u201cETHICA ORDINE GEOMETRICO\nDEMONSTRATA\u201d OF SPINOZA.\n1. The general order which, in the investigations of the following chapter,\nI design to pursue, is the following. I shall examine what are the actual\npremises involved in the demonstrations of some of the general propositions\nof the above treatises, whether those premises be expressed or implied. By the\nactual premises I mean whatever propositions are assumed in the course of the\nargument, without being proved, and are employed as parts of the foundation\nupon which the final conclusion is built. The premises thus determined, I\nshall express in the language of symbols, and I shall then deduce from them\nby the methods developed in the previous chapters of this work, the most\nimportant inferences which they involve, in addition to the particular inferences\nactually drawn by the authors. I shall in some instances modify the premises\nby the omission of some fact or principle which is contained in them, or by\nthe addition or substitution of some new proposition, and shall determine how\nby such change the ultimate conclusions are affected. In the pursuit of these\nobjects it will not devolve upon me to inquire, except incidentally, how far the\nmetaphysical principles laid down in these celebrated productions are worthy of\nconfidence, but only to ascertain what conclusions may justly be drawn from\ngiven premises; and in doing this, to exemplify the perfect liberty which we\npossess as concerns both the choice and the order of the elements of the final or\nconcluding propositions, viz., as to determining what elementary propositions\nare true or false, and what are true or false under given restrictions, or in given\ncombinations.\n2. The chief practical difficulty of this inquiry will consist, not in the\napplication of the method to the premises once determined, but in ascertaining\nwhat the premises are. In what area regarded as the most rigorous examples of\nreasoning applied to metaphysical questions, it will occasionally be found that\ndifferent trains of thought are blended together; that particular but essential\n143\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 144\nparts of the demonstration are given parenthetically, or out of the main course of\nthe argument; that the meaning of a premiss may be in some degree ambiguous;\nand, not unfrequently, that arguments, viewed by the strict laws of formal\nreasoning, are incorrect or inconclusive. The difficulty of determining and\ndistinctly exhibiting the true premises of a demonstration may,\nin such cases, be very considerable. But it is a difficulty which must be\novercome by all who would ascertain whether a particular conclusion is proved\nor not, whatever form they may be prepared or disposed to give to the ulterior\nprocess of reasoning. It is a difficulty, therefore, which is not peculiar to the\nmethod of this work, though it manifests itself more distinctly in connexion with\nthis method than with any other. So intimate, indeed, is this connexion, that it\nis impossible, employing the method of this treatise, to form even a conjecture\nas to the validity of a conclusion, without a distinct apprehension and exact\nstatement of all the premises upon which it rests. In the more usual course\nof procedure, nothing is, however, more common than to examine some of the\nsteps of a train of argument, and thence to form a vague general impression of\nthe scope of the whole, without any such preliminary and thorough analysis of\nthe premises which it involves.\nThe necessity of a rigorous determination of the real premises of a demonstration\nought not to be regarded as an evil; especially as, when that task is accomplished,\nevery source doubt or ambiguity is removed. In employing the method of this\ntreatise, the order in which premises are arranged, the mode of connexion\nwhich they exhibit, with every similar circumstance may be esteemed a matter\nof indifference, and the process inference is conducted with a precision which\nmight almost termed mechanical.\n3. The \u201cDemonstration of the Being and Attributes of God,\u201d consists of a\nseries of propositions or theorems, each of them proved by means of premises\nresolvable, for the most part, into two distinct classes, viz., facts of observation,\nsuch as the existence of a material world, the phenomenon of motion, &c., and\nhypothetical principles, the authority and universality of which are supposed to\nbe recognised `a priori. It is, of course, upon the truth of the latter, assuming\nthe correctness of the reasoning, that the validity of the demonstration really\ndepends. But whatever may be thought of its claims in this respect, it is\nunquestionable that, as an intellectual performance, its merits are very high.\nThough the trains of argument of which it consists are not in general very clearly\narranged, they are almost always specimens of correct Logic, and they exhibit\na subtlety of apprehension and a force of reasoning which have seldom been\nequalled, never perhaps surpassed. We see in them the consummation of those\nintellectual efforts which were awakened in the realm of metaphysical inquiry,\nat a period when the dominion of hypothetical principles was less questioned\nthan it now is, and when the rigorous demonstrations of the newly risen school\nof mathematical physics seemed to have furnished a model for their direction.\nThey appear to me for this reason (not to mention the dignity of the subject of\nwhich they treat) to be deserving of high consideration; and I do not deem it a\nvain or superfluous task to expend upon some of them a careful analysis.\n4. The Ethics of Benedict Spinoza is a treatise, the object of which is to\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 145\nprove the identity of God and the universe, and to establish, upon this doctrine,\na system of morals and of philosophy. The analysis of its main argument is\nextremely difficult, owing not to the complexity of the separate propositions\nwhich it involves, but to the use of vague definitions, and of axioms which,\nthrough a like defect of clearness, it is perplexing to determine whether we\nought to accept or to reject. While the reasoning of Dr. Samuel Clarke is in\npart verbal, that of Spinoza is so in a much greater degree; and perhaps this\nis the reason why, to some minds, it has appeared to possess a formal cogency,\nto which in reality it possesses no just claim. These points will, however, be\nconsidered in the proper place.\nclarke\u2019s demonstration.\nProposition I.\n5. \u201cSomething has existed from eternity.\u201d\nThe proof is as follows:\u2013\n\u201cFor since something now is, \u2019tis manifest that something always was.\nOtherwise the things that now are must have risen out of nothing, absolutely\nand without cause. Which is a plain contradiction in terms. For to say a thing\nis produced, and yet that there is no cause at all of that production, is to say\nthat something is effected when it is effected by nothing, that is, at the same\ntime when it is not effected at all. Whatever exists has a cause of its existence,\neither in the necessity of its own nature, and thus it must have been of itself\neternal: or in the will of some other being, and then that other being must, at\nleast in the order of nature and causality, have existed before it.\u201d\nLet us now proceed to analyze the above demonstration. Its first sentence\nis resolvable into the following propositions:\n1st. Something is.\n2nd. If something is, either something always was, or the things that now\nare must have risen out of nothing.\nThe next portion of the demonstration consists of a proof that the second of\nthe above alternatives, viz., \u201cThe things that now are have risen out of nothing,\u201d\nis impossible, and it may formally be resolved as follows:\n3rd. If the things that now are have risen out of nothing, something has been\neffected, and at the same time that something has been effected by nothing.\n4th. If that something has been effected by nothing, it has not been effected\nat all.\nThe second portion of this argument appears to be a mere assumption of\nthe point to be proved, or an attempt to make that point clearer by a different\nverbal statement.\nThe third and last portion of the demonstration contains a distinct proof\nof the truth of either the original proposition to be proved, viz., \u201cSomething\nalways was,\u201d or the point proved in the second part of the demonstration, viz.,\nthe untenable nature of the hypothesis, that \u201cthe things that now are have risen\nout of nothing.\u201d It is resolvable as follows:\u2013\n5th. If something is, either it exists by the necessity of its own nature, or it\nexists by the will of another being.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 146\n6th. If it exists by the necessity of its own nature, something always was.\n7th. If it exists by the will of another being, then the proposition, that the\nthings which exist have arisen out of nothing, is false.\nThe last proposition is not expressed in the same form in the text of Dr.\nClarke; but his expressed conclusion of the prior existence of another Being is\nclearly meant as equivalent to a denial of the proposition that the things which\nnow are have risen out of nothing.\nIt appears, therefore, that the demonstration consists of two distinct trains\nof argument: one of those trains comprising what I have designated as the first\nand second parts of the demonstration; the other comprising the first and third\nparts. Let us consider the latter train.\nThe premises are:\u2013\n1st. Something is.\n2nd. If something is, either something always was, or the things that now\nare have risen out of nothing.\n3rd. If something is, either it exists in the necessity of its own nature, or it\nexists by the will of another being.\n4th. If it exists in the necessity of its own nature, something always was.\n5th. If it exists by the will of another being, then the hypothesis, that the\nthings which now are have risen out of nothing, is false.\nWe must now express symbolically the above proposition.\nLet\nx = Something is.\ny = Something always was.\nz = The things which now are have risen from nothing.\np = It exists in the necessity of its own nature\n(i.e. the something spoken of above).\nq = It exists by the will of another Being.\nIt must be understood, that by the expression, Let x = \u201cSomething is,\u201d is\nmeant no more than that x is the representative symbol of that proposition (XI.\n7), the equations x = 1, x = 0, respectively declaring its truth and its falsehood.\nThe equations of the premises are:\u2013\n1st. x = 1;\n2nd. x = v[y(1 \u2212 x) + z(1 \u2212 y)];\n3rd. x = v[p(1 \u2212 q) + q(1 \u2212 p)];\n4th. p = vy;\n5th. q = v(1 \u2212 z);\nand on eliminating the several indefinite symbols v, we have\n1 \u2212 x = 0; (1)\nx[yz + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)] = 0; (2)\nx[pq + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)] = 0; (3)\np(q \u2212 y) = 0; (4)\nqz = 0. (5)\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 147\n6. First, I shall examine whether any conclusions are deducible from the\nabove, concerning the truth or falsity of the single propositions represented by\nthe symbols y, z, p, q, viz., of the propositions, \u201cSomething always was;\u201d \u201cThe\nthings which now are have risen from nothing;\u201d \u201cThe something which is exists\nby the necessity of its own nature;\u201d \u201cThe something which is exists by the will\nof another being.\u201d\nFor this purpose we must separately eliminate all the symbols but y, all these\nbut z, &c. The resulting equation will determine whether any such separate\nrelations exist.\nTo eliminate x from (1), (2), and (3), it is only necessary to substitute in\n(2) and (3) the value of x derived from (1). We find as the results,\nyz + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = 0. (6)\npq + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q) = 0. (7)\nTo eliminate p we have from (4) and (7), by addition,\np(1 \u2212 y) + pq + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q) = 0; (8)\nwhence we find,\n(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 q) = 0. (9)\nTo eliminate q from (5) and (9), we have\nqz + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 q) = 0;\nwhence we find\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (10)\nThere now remain but the two equations (6) and (10), which, on addition,\ngive\nyz + 1 \u2212 y = 0.\nEliminating from this equation z, we have\n1 \u2212 y = 0, or, y = 1. (11)\nEliminating from the same equation y, we have\nz = 0. (12)\nThe interpretation of (11) is\nSomething always was.\nThe interpretation of (12) is\nThe things which are have not risen from nothing.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 148\nNext resuming the system (6), (7), with the two equations (4), (5), let us\ndetermine the two equations involving p and q respectively.\nTo eliminate y we have from (4) and (6),\np(1 \u2212 y) + yz + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = (0);\nwhence\n(p + 1 \u2212 z)z = 0, or, pz = 0. (13)\nTo eliminate z from (5) and (13), we have\nqz + pz = 0;\nwhence we get,\n0 = 0.\nThere remains then but the equation (7), from which eliminating q, we have\n0 = 0 for the final equation, in p.\nHence there is no conclusion derivable from the premises affirming the simple\ntruth or falsehood of the proposition, \u201cThe something which is exists in the\nnecessity of its own nature.\u201d And as, on eliminating p, there is the same result,\n0 = 0, for the ultimate equation in q, it also follows, that there is no conclusion\ndeducible from the premises as to the simple truth or falsehood of the proposition,\n\u201cThe something which is exists by the will of another Being.\u201d\nOf relations connecting more than one of the propositions represented by the\nelementary symbols, it is needless to consider any but that which is denoted by\nthe equation (7) connecting p and q, inasmuch as the propositions represented\nby the remaining symbols are absolutely true or false independently of any\nconnexion of the kind here spoken of. The interpretation of (7), placed under\nthe form\np(1 \u2212 q) + q(1 \u2212 p) = 1, is,\nThe something which is, either exists in the necessity of its own nature, or\nby the will of another being.\nI have exhibited the details of the above analysis with a, perhaps, needless\nfulness and prolixity, because in the examples which will follow, I propose rather\nto indicate the steps by which results are obtained, than to incur the danger of\na wearisome frequency of repetition. The conclusions which have resulted from\nthe above application of the method are easily verified by ordinary reasoning.\nThe reader will have no difficulty in applying the method to the other train\nof premises involved in Dr. Clarke\u2019s first Proposition, and deducing from them\nthe two first of the conclusions to which the above analysis has led.\nProposition II.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 149\n7. Some one unchangeable and independent Being has existed from eternity.\nThe premises from which the above proposition is prove are the following:\n1st. Something has always existed.\n2nd. If something has always existed, either there has existed some one\nunchangeable and independent being, or the whole of existing things has been\ncomprehended in a succession of changeable and dependent beings.\n3rd. If the universe has consisted of a succession of changeable and dependent\nbeings, either that series has had a cause from without, or it has had a cause\nfrom within.\n4th. It has not had a cause from without (because it includes, by hypothesis,\nall things that exist).\n5th. It has not had a cause from within (because no part is necessary, and\nif no part is necessary, the whole cannot be necessary).\nOmitting, merely for brevity, the subsidiary proofs contained in the\nparentheses of the fourth and fifth premiss, we may represent the premises\nas follows:\nLet x = Something has always existed.\ny = There has existed some one unchangeable and independent being.\nz = There has existed a succession of changeable and dependent beings.\np = That series has had a cause from without.\nq = That series has had a cause from within.\nThen we have the following system of equations, viz.:\n1st. x = 1;\n2nd. x = v{y(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 y)};\n3rd. z = v{p(1 \u2212 q) + (1 \u2212 p)q};\n4th. p = 0;\n5th. q = 0 :\nwhich, on the separate elimination of the indefinite symbols v, gives\nl \u2212 x = 0; (1)\nx{yz + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)} = 0; (2)\nz{pq + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)} = 0; (3)\np = 0; (4)\nq = 0. (5)\nThe elimination from the above system of x, p, q, and y, conducts to the\nequation\nz = 0.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 150\nAnd the elimination of x, p, q, and z, conducts in a similar manner to the\nequation\ny = 1.\nOf which equations the respective interpretations are:\n1st. The whole of existing things has not been comprehended in a succession\nof changeable and dependent beings.\n2nd. There has existed some one unchangeable and independent being.\nThe latter of these is the proposition which Dr. Clarke proves. As, by the\nabove analysis, all the propositions represented by the literal symbols x, y, z,\np, q, are determined as absolutely true or false, it is needless to inquire into the\nexistence of any further relations connecting those propositions together.\nAnother proof is given of Prop. II., which for brevity I pass over. It may be\nobserved, that the \u201cimpossibility of infinite succession,\u201d the proof of which forms\na part of Clarke\u2019s argument, has commonly been assumed as a fundamental\nprinciple of metaphysics, and extended to other questions than that of causation.\nAristotle applies it to establish the necessity of first principles of demonstration;\n1 the necessity of an end (the good), in human actions, &c. 2 There is, perhaps,\nno principle more frequently referred to in his writings. By the schoolmen it\nwas similarly applied to prove the impossibility of an infinite subordination of\ngenera and species, and hence the necessary existence of universals. Apparently\nthe impossibility of our forming a definite and complete conception of an infinite\nseries, i.e. of comprehending it as a whole, has been confounded with a logical\ninconsistency, or contradiction in the idea itself.\n8. The analysis of the following argument depends upon the theory of\nPrimary Propositions.\nProposition III.\nThat unchangeable and independent Being must be self-existent.\nThe premises are:\u2013\n1. Every being must either have come into existence out of nothing, or it\nmust have been produced by some external cause, or it must be self-existent.\n2. No being has come into existence out of nothing.\n3. The unchangeable and independent Being has not been produced by an\nexternal cause.\nFor the symbolical expression of the above, let us assume,\nx = Beings which have arisen out of nothing.\ny = Beings which have been produced by an external cause.\nz = Beings which are self-existent.\nw = The unchangeable and independent Being.\n1Metaphysics, III. 4; Anal. Post. I, 19, et seq.\n2Nic. Ethics, Book I. Cap. II.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 151\nThen we have\nx(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) + y(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = l, (1)\nx = 0, (2)\nw = v(1 \u2212 y), (3)\nfrom the last of which eliminating v,\nwy = 0. (4)\nWhenever, as above, the value of a symbol is given as 0 or 1, it is best\neliminated by simple substitution. Thus the elimination of x gives\ny(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 y) = 1; (5)\nor, yz + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = 0. (6)\nNow adding (4) and (6), and eliminating y, we get\nw(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\n\u2234 w = vz;\nthe interpretation of which is,\u2013The unchangeable and independent being is\nnecessarily self-existing.\nOf (5), in its actual form, the interpretation is,\u2013Every being has either been\nproduced by an external cause, or it is self-existent.\n9. In Dr. Samuel Clarke\u2019s observations on the above proposition occurs a\nremarkable argument, designed to prove that the material world is not the self-\nexistent being above spoken of. The passage to which I refer is the following:\n\u201cIf matter be supposed to exist necessarily, then in that necessary existence\nthere is either included the power of gravitation, or not. If not, then in a world\nmerely material, and in which no intelligent being presides, there never could\nhave been any motion; because motion, as has been already shown, and is now\ngranted in the question, is not necessary of itself. But if the power of gravitation\nbe included in the pretended necessary existence of matter: then, it following\nnecessarily that there must be a vacuum (as the incomparable Sir Isaac Newton\nhas abundantly demonstrated that there must, if gravitation be an universal\nquality or affection of matter), it follows likewise, that matter is not a necessary\nbeing. For if a vacuum actually be, then it is plainly more than possible for\nmatter not to be.\u201d\u2013(pp. 25, 26).\nIt will, upon attentive examination, be found that the actual premises\ninvolved in the above demonstration are the following:\n1st. If matter is a necessary being, either the property of gravitation is\nnecessarily present, or it is necessarily absent.\n2nd. If gravitation is necessarily absent, and the world is not subject to any\npresiding Intelligence, motion does not exist.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 152\n3rd. If the property of gravitation is necessarily present, existence of a\nvacuum is necessary.\n4th. If the existence of a vacuum is necessary, matter is not necessary being.\n5th. If matter is a necessary being, the world is not subject to a presiding\nIntelligence.\n6th. Motion exists.\nOf the above premises the first four are expressed in the demonstration; the\nfifth is implied in the connexion of its first and second sentences; and the sixth\nexpresses a fact, which the author does not appear to have thought it necessary\nto state, but which is obviously a part of the ground of his reasoning. Let us\nrepresent the elementary propositions in the following manner:\nLet x = Matter is a necessary being.\ny = Gravitation is necessarily present.\nt = Gravitation is necessarily absent.\nz = The world is merely material, and not subject to any presiding Intelligence.\nw = Motion exists.\nv = A vacuum is necessary.\nThen the system of premises will be represented by the following equations,\nin which q is employed as the symbol of time indefinite:\nx = q{y(1 \u2212 t) + (1 \u2212 y)t}.\ntz = q(1 \u2212 w).\ny = qv.\nv = q(1 \u2212 x).\nx = qz.\nw = 1.\nFrom which, if we eliminate the symbols q, we have the following system,\nviz.:\nx{yt + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 t)} = 0. (1)\ntzw = 0. (2)\ny(1 \u2212 v) = 0. (3)\nvx = 0. (4)\nx(1 \u2212 z) = 0. (5)\n1 \u2212 w = 0. (6)\nNow if from these equations we eliminate w, v, z, y, and t, we obtain the\nequation\nx = 0,\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 153\nwhich expresses the proposition, Matter is not a necessary being. This is Dr.\nClarke\u2019s conclusion. If we endeavour to eliminate any other set of five symbols\n(except the set v, z, y, t, and x, which would give w = 1), we obtain a\nresult of the form 0 = 0. It hence appears that there are no other conclusions\nexpressive of the absolute truth or falsehood of any of the elementary propositions\ndesignated by single symbols.\nOf conclusions expressed by equations involving two symbols, there exists\nbut the following, viz.:\u2013 If the world is merely material, and not subject to a\npresiding Intelligence, gravitation is not necessarily absent. This conclusion is\nexpressed by the equation\ntz = 0, whence z = q(1 \u2212 t).\nIf in the above analysis we suppress the concluding premiss, expressing the\nfact of the existence of motion, and leave the hypothetical principles which are\nembodied in the remaining premises untouched, some remarkable conclusions\nfollow. To these I shall direct attention in the following chapter.\n10. Of the remainder of Dr. Clarke\u2019s argument I shall briefly state the\nsubstance and connexion, dwelling only on certain portions of it which are of a\nmore complex character than the others, and afford better illustrations of the\nmethod of this work.\nIn Prop. iv. it is shown that the substance or essence of the self-existent\nbeing is incomprehensible. The tenor of the reasoning employed is, that we are\nignorant of the essential nature of all other things,\u2013much more, then, of the\nessence of the self-existent being.\nIn Prop. v. it is contended that \u201cthough the substance or essence of\nthe self-existent being is itself absolutely incomprehensible to us, yet many of\nthe essential attributes of his nature are strictly demonstrable, as well as his\nexistence.\u201d\nIn Prop. vi. it is argued that \u201cthe self-existent being must of necessity\nbe infinite and omnipresent;\u201d and it is contended that his infinity must be\n\u201can infinity of fulness as well as of immensity.\u201d The ground upon which the\ndemonstration proceeds is, that an absolute necessity of existence must be\nindependent of time, place, and circumstance, free from limitation, and therefore\nexcluding all imperfection. And hence it is inferred that the self-existent being\nmust be \u201ca most simple, unchangeable, incorruptible being, without parts,\nfigure, motion, or any other such properties as we find in matter.\u201d\nThe premises actually employed may be exhibited as follows:\n1. If a finite being is self-existent, it is a contradiction to suppose it not to\nexist.\n2. A finite being may, without contradiction, be absent from one place.\n3. That which may without contradiction be absent from one place may\nwithout contradiction be absent from all places.\n4. That which may without contradiction be absent from all places may\nwithout contradiction be supposed not to exist.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 154\nLet us assume\nx = Finite beings.\ny = Things self-existent.\nz = Things which it is a contradiction to suppose not to exist.\nw = Things which may be absent without contradiction from one place.\nt = Things which without contradiction may be absent from every place.\nWe have on expressing the above, and eliminating the indefinite symbols,\nxy(1 \u2212 z) = 0. (1)\nx(1 \u2212 w) = 0. (2)\nw(1 \u2212 t) = 0. (3)\ntz = 0. (4)\nEliminating in succession t, w, and z, we get\nxy = 0,\n\u2234 y = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x);\nthe interpretation of which is,\u2013Whatever is self-existent is infinite.\nIn Prop. vii. it is argued that the self-existent being must of necessity be\nOne. The order of the proof is, that the self-existent being is \u201cnecessarily\nexistent,\u201d that \u201cnecessity absolute in itself is simple and uniform, and without\nany possible difference or variety,\u201d that all \u201cvariety or difference of existence\u201d\nimplies dependence; and hence that \u201cwhatever exists necessarily is the one\nsimple essence of the self-existent being.\u201d\nThe conclusion is also made to flow from the following premises:\u2014\n1. If there are two or more necessary and independent beings, either of them\nmay be supposed to exist alone.\n2. If either may be supposed to exist alone, it is not a contradiction to\nsuppose the other not to exist.\n3. If it is not a contradiction to suppose this, there are not two necessary\nand independent beings.\nLet us represent the elementary propositions as follows:\u2013\nx = there exist two necessary independent beings.\ny = either may be supposed to exist alone.\nz = it is not a contradiction to suppose the other not to exist.\nWe have then, on proceeding as before,\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (1)\ny(1 \u2212 z) = 0. (2)\nzx = 0. (3)\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 155\nEliminating y and z, we have\nx = 0.\nWhence, There do not exist two necessary and independent beings.\n11. To the premises upon which the two previous propositions rest, it\nis well known that Bishop Butler, who at the time of the publication of the\n\u201cDemonstration,\u201d was a student in a non-conformist academy, made objection\nin some celebrated letters, which, together with Dr. Clarke\u2019s replies to them,\nare usually appended to editions of the work. The real question at issue is\nthe validity of the principle, that \u201cwhatsoever is absolutely necessary at all is\nabsolutely necessary in every part of space, and in every point of duration,\u201d\u2014a\nprinciple assumed in Dr. Clarke\u2019s reasoning, and explicitly stated in his reply\nto Butler\u2019s first letter. In his second communication Butler says: \u201cI do not\nconceive that the idea of ubiquity is contained in the idea of self-existence,\nor directly follows from it, any otherwise than as whatever exists must exist\nsomewhere.\u201d That is to say, necessary existence implies existence in some part\nof space, but not in every part. It does not appear that Dr. Clarke was ever\nable to dispose effectually of this objection. The whole of the correspondence\nis extremely curious and interesting. The objections of Butler are precisely\nthose which would occur to an acute mind impressed with the conviction, that\nupon the sifting of first principles, rather than upon any mechanical dexterity\nof reasoning, the successful investigation of truth mainly depends. And the\nreplies of Dr. Clarke, although they cannot be admitted as satisfactory, evince,\nin a remarkable degree, that peculiar intellectual power which is manifest in the\nwork from which the discussion arose.\n12. In Prop. viii. it is argued that the self-existent and original cause of all\nthings must be an Intelligent Being.\nThe main argument adduced in support of this proposition is, that as the\ncause is more excellent than the effect, the self-existent being, as the cause and\noriginal of all things, must contain in itself the perfections of all things; and that\nIntelligence is one of the perfections manifested in a part of the creation. It is\nfurther argued that this perfection is not a modification of figure, divisibility,\nor any of the known properties of matter; for these are not perfections, but\nlimitations. To this is added the `a posteriori argument from the manifestation\nof design in the frame of the universe.\nThere is appended, however, a distinct argument for the existence of an\nintelligent self-existent being, founded upon the ph\u00e6nomenal existence of motion\nin the universe. I shall briefly exhibit this proof, and shall apply to it the method\nof the present treatise.\nThe argument, omitting unimportant explanations, is as follows:\u2013\n\u201d\u2019Tis evident there is some such a thing as motion in the world; which\neither began at some time or other, or was eternal. If it began in time, then the\nquestion is granted that the first cause is an intelligent being.... On the contrary,\nif motion was eternal, either it was eternally caused by some eternal intelligent\nbeing, or it must of itself be necessary and self-existent, or else, without any\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 156\nnecessity in its own nature, and without any external necessary cause, it must\nhave existed from eternity by an endless successive communication. If motion\nwas eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being, this also is granting\nthe question as to the present dispute. If it was of itself necessary and self-\nexistent, then it follows that it must be a contradiction in terms to suppose any\nmatter to be at rest. And yet, at the same time, because the determination\nof this self-existent motion must be every way at once, the effect of it would\nbe nothing else but a perpetual rest.... But if it be said that motion, without\nany necessity in its own nature, and without any external necessary cause, has\nexisted from eternity merely by an endless successive communication, as Spinoza\ninconsistently enough seems to assert, this I have before shown (in the proof of\nthe second general proposition of this discourse) to be a plain contradiction.\nIt remains, therefore, that motion must of necessity be originally caused by\nsomething that is intelligent.\u201d\nThe premises of the above argument may be thus disposed:\n1. If motion began in time, the first cause is an intelligent being. 2. If\nmotion has existed from eternity, either it has been eternally caused by some\neternal intelligent being, or it is self-existent, or it must have existed by endless\nsuccessive communication.\n3. If motion has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being, the\nfirst cause is an intelligent being.\n4. If it is self-existent, matter is at rest and not at rest.\n5. That motion has existed by endless successive communication, and that\nat the same time it is not self-existent, and has not been eternally caused by\nsome eternal intelligent being, is false.\nTo express these propositions, let us assume\u2014\nx = Motion began in time (and therefore)\n1 \u2212 x = Motion has existed from eternity.\ny = The first cause is an intelligent being.\np = Motion has been eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being.\nq = Motion is self-existent.\nr = Motion has existed by endless successive communication.\ns = Matter is at rest.\nThe equations of the premises then are\u2014\nx = vy.\n1\u2212x = v {p (1 \u2212 q) (1 \u2212 r) + q (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 r) + r (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 q)} .\np = vy.\nq = vs (1 \u2212 s) = 0.\nr (1 \u2212 q) (1 \u2212 p) = 0.\nSince, by the fourth equation, q = 0, we obtain, on substituting for q its value\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 157\nin the remaining equations, the system\nx = vy,\np = vy,\n1 \u2212 x = v {p (1 \u2212 r) + r (1 \u2212 p)} ,\nr (1 \u2212 p) = 0,\nfrom which eliminating the indefinite symbols v, we have the final reduced\nsystem,\nx (1 \u2212 y) = 0, (1)\n(1 \u2212 x) {pr + (1 \u2212 p) (1 \u2212 r)} = 0, (2)\np (1 \u2212 y) = 0. (3)\nr (1 \u2212 p) = 0. (4)\nWe shall first seek the value of y, the symbol involved in Dr. Clarke\u2019s conclusion.\nFirst, eliminating x from (1) and (2), we have\n(1 \u2212 y){pr + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 r)} = 0. (5)\nNext, to eliminate r from (4) and (5), we have\nr(l \u2212 p) + (1 \u2212 y){pr + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 r)} = 0,\n\u2234 {1 \u2212 p + (1 \u2212 y)p} \u00d7 (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 p) = 0;\nwhence\n(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 p) = 0. (6)\nLastly, eliminating p from (3) and (6), we have\n1 \u2212 y = 0,\n\u2234 y = 1,\nwhich expresses the required conclusion, The first cause is an intelligent\nbeing.\nLet us now examine what other conclusions are deducible from the premises.\nIf we substitute the value just found for y in the equations (1), (2), (3), (4),\nthey are reduced to the following pair of equations, viz.,\n(1 \u2212 x){pr + (l \u2212 p)(l \u2212 r)} = 0, r(l \u2212 p) = 0. (7)\nEliminating from these equations x, we have\nr(1 \u2212 p) = 0, whence r = vp,\nwhich expresses the conclusion, If motion has existed by endless successive\ncommunication, it has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being.\nAgain eliminating, from the given pair, r, we have\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 p) = 0,\nor, 1 \u2212 x = vp,\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 158\nwhich expresses the conclusion, If motion has existed from eternity, it has been\neternally caused by some eternal intelligent being.\nLastly, from the same original pair eliminating p, we get\n(1 \u2212 x)r = 0,\nwhich, solved in the form\n1 \u2212 x = r(1 \u2212 r),\ngives the conclusion, If motion has existed from eternity, it has not existed\nby an endless successive communication.\nSolved under the form\nr = vx,\nthe above equation leads to the equivalent conclusion, If motion exists by an\nendless successive communication, it began in time.\n13. Now it will appear to the reader that the first and last of the above\nfour conclusions are inconsistent with each other. The two consequences drawn\nfrom the hypothesis that motion exists by an endless successive communication,\nviz., 1st, that it has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being; 2ndly,\nthat it began in time,\u2014are plainly at variance. Nevertheless, they are both\nrigorous deductions from the original premises. The opposition between them\nis not of a logical, but of what is technically termed a material, character. This\nopposition might, however, have been formally stated in the premises. We\nmight have added to them a formal proposition, asserting that \u201cwhatever is\nexternally caused by an eternal intelligent being, does not begin in time.\u201d Had\nthis been done, no such opposition as now appears in our conclusions could\nhave presented itself. Formal logic can only take account of relations which are\nformally expressed (VI. 16); and it may thus, in particular instances, become\nnecessary to express, in a formal manner, some connexion among the premises\nwhich, without actual statement, is involved in the very meaning of the language\nemployed.\nTo illustrate what has been said, let us add to the equations (2) and (4) the\nequation\npx = 0,\nwhich expresses the condition above adverted to. We have\n(1 \u2212 x){pr + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 r)} + r(1 \u2212 p) + px = 0. (8)\nEliminating p from this, we find simply\nr = 0,\nwhich expresses the proposition, Motion does not exist by an endless successive\ncommunication. If now we substitute for r its value in (8), we have\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 p) + px = 0, or, 1 \u2212 x = p;\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 159\nwhence we have the interpretation, If motion has existed from eternity, it has\nbeen eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being; together with the converse\nof that proposition.\nIn Prop. ix. it is argued, that \u201cthe self-existent and original cause of all\nthings is not a necessary agent, but a being endued with liberty and choice.\u201d\nThe proof is based mainly upon his possession of intelligence, and upon the\nexistence of final causes, implying design and choice. To the objection that the\nsupreme cause operates by necessity for the production of what is best, it is\nreplied, that this is a necessity of fitness and wisdom, and not of nature.\n14. In Prop. x. it is argued, that \u201cthe self-existent being, the supreme\ncause of all things, must of necessity have infinite power.\u201d The ground of the\ndemonstration is, that as \u201call the powers of all things are derived from him,\nnothing can make any difficulty or resistance to the execution of his will.\u201d It is\ndefined that the infinite power of the self-existent being does not extend to the\n\u201cmaking of a thing which implies a contradiction,\u201d or the doing of that \u201cwhich\nwould imply imperfection (whether natural or moral) in the being to whom such\npower is ascribed,\u201d but that it does extend to the creation of matter, and of an\nimmaterial, cogitative substance, endued with a power of beginning motion, and\nwith a liberty of will or choice. Upon this doctrine of liberty it is contended that\nwe are able to give a satisfactory answer to \u201cthat ancient and great question,\n\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd, what is the cause and original of evil?\u201d The argument on this\nhead I shall briefly exhibit,\n\u201cAll that we call evil is either an evil of imperfection, as the want of certain\nfaculties or excellencies which other creatures have; or natural evil, as pain,\ndeath, and the like; or moral evil, as all kinds of vice. The first of these is\nnot properly an evil; for every power, faculty, or perfection, which any creature\nenjoys, being the free gift of God,. . . it is plain the want of any certain faculty\nor perfection in any kind of creatures, which never belonged to their natures\nis no more an evil to them, than their never having been created or brought\ninto being at all could properly have been called an evil. The second kind of\nevil, which we call natural evil, is either a necessary consequence of the former,\nas death to a creature on whose nature immortality was never conferred; and\nthen it is no more properly an evil than the former. Or else it is counterpoised\non the whole with as great or greater good, as the afflictions and sufferings\nof good men, and then also it is not properly an evil; or else, lastly, it is a\npunishment, and then it is a necessary consequence of the third and last kind\nof evil, viz., moral evil. And this arises wholly from the abuse of liberty which\nGod gave to His creatures for other purposes, and which it was reasonable and\nfit to give them for the perfection and order of the whole creation. Only they,\ncontrary to God\u2019s intention and command, have abused what was necessary to\nthe perfection of the whole, to the corruption and depravation of themselves.\nAnd thus all sorts of evils have entered into the world without any diminution\nto the infinite goodness of the Creator and Governor thereof.\u201d\u2014p. 112.\nThe main premises of the above argument may be thus stated:\n1st. All reputed evil is either evil of imperfection, or natural evil, or moral\nevil.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 160\n2nd. Evil of imperfection is not absolute evil.\n3rd. Natural evil is either a consequence of evil of imperfection, or it is\ncompensated with greater good, or it is a consequence of moral evil.\n4th. That which is either a consequence of evil of imperfection, or is\ncompensated with greater good, is not absolute evil.\n5th. All absolute evils are included in reputed evils.\nTo express these premises let us assume\u2014\nw = reputed evil.\nx = evil of imperfection.\ny = natural evil.\nz = moral evil.\np = consequence of evil of imperfection.\nq = compensated with greater good.\nr = consequence of moral evil.\nt = absolute evil.\nThen, regarding the premises as Primary Propositions, of which all the\npredicates are particular, and the conjunctions either, or, as absolutely\ndisjunctive, we have the following equations:\nw = v {x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 q) + y(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)}\nx = v(1 \u2212 t).\ny = v {p(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r) + q(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 r) + r(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)}\np(l \u2212 q) + q(l \u2212 p) = v(1 \u2212 t).\nt = vw .\nFrom which, if we separately eliminate the symbol v, we have\nw {1 \u2212 x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)} = 0, (1)\nxt = 0, (2)\ny {1 \u2212 p(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r) \u2212 q(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 r) \u2212 r(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)} = 0, (3)\n{p(1 \u2212 q) + q(1 \u2212 p)} t = 0, (4)\nt(1 \u2212 w) = 0. (5)\nLet it be required, first, to find what conclusion the premises warrant us\nin forming respecting absolute evils, as concerns their dependence upon moral\nevils, and the consequences of moral evils.\nFor this purpose we must determine t in terms of z and r.\nThe symbols w, x, y, p, q must therefore be eliminated. The process is easy,\nas any set of the equations is reducible to a single equation by addition.\nEliminating w from (1) and (5), we have\nt {1 \u2212 x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)} = 0. (6)\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 161\nThe elimination of p from (3) and (4) gives\nyqr + yqt + yt(1 \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 q) = 0. (7)\nThe elimination of q from this gives\nyt(1 \u2212 r) = 0. (8)\nThe elimination of x between (2) and (6) gives\nt {yz + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)} = 0. (9)\nThe elimination of y from (8) and (9) gives\nt(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 r) = 0.\nThis is the only relation existing between the elements t, z, and r. We hence\nget\nt = 0\n(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 r)\n= 0\n0 zr + 0\n0 z(1 \u2212 r) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 z)r + 0(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 r)\n= 0\n0 z + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 z)r;\nthe interpretation of which is, Absolute evil is either moral evil, or it is, if not\nmoral evil, a consequence of moral evil.\nAny of the results obtained in the process of the above solution furnish us\nwith interpretations. Thus from (8) we might deduce\nt = 0\ny(1 \u2212 r) = 0\n0 yr + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y)r + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 r)\n= 0\n0 yr + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y);\nwhence, Absolute evils are either natural evils, which are the consequences of\nmoral evils, or they are not natural evils at all.\nA variety of other conclusions may be deduced from the given equations in\nreply to questions which may be arbitrarily proposed. Of such I shall give a few\nexamples, without exhibiting the intermediate processes of solution.\nQuest. 1.\u2014Can any relation be deduced from the premises connecting the\nfollowing elements, viz.: absolute evils, consequences of evils of imperfection,\nevils compensated with greater good?\nAns.\u2014No relation exists. If we eliminate all the symbols but z, p, q, the\nresult is 0 = 0.\nQuest. 2.\u2014Is any relation implied between absolute evils, evils of imperfection,\nand consequences of evils of imperfection.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 162\nAns.\u2014The final relation between x, t, and p is\nxt + pt = 0;\nwhence\nt = 0\np + x = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 x).\nTherefore, Absolute evils are neither evils of imperfection, nor consequences of\nevils of imperfection. Quest. 3. \u2014 Required the relation of natural evils to evils\nof imperfection and evils compensated with greater good.\nWe find\npqy = 0,\n\u2234 y = 0\npq = 0\n0 p(1 \u2212 q) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 p).\nTherefore, Natural evils are either consequences of evils of imperfection which\nare not compensated with greater good, or they are not consequences of evils of\nimperfection at all.\nQuest. 4. \u2014 In what relation do those natural evils which are not moral\nevils stand to absolute evils and the consequences of moral evils?\nIf y(1 \u2212 z) = s, we find, after elimination,\nts(1 \u2212 r) = 0;\n\u2234 s = 0\nt(1 \u2212 r) = 0\n0 tr + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 t).\nTherefore, Natural evils, which are not moral evils, are either absolute evils,\nwhich are the consequences of moral evils, or they are not absolute evils at all.\nThe following conclusions have been deduced in a similar manner. The\nsubject of each conclusion will show of what particular things a description was\nrequired, and the predicate will show what elements it was designed to involve:\n\u2014\nAbsolute evils, which are not consequences of moral evils, are moral and not\nnatural evils.\nAbsolute evils which are not moral evils are natural evils, which are the\nconsequences of moral evils.\nNatural evils which are not consequences of moral evils are not absolute evils.\nLastly, let us seek a description of evils which are not absolute, expressed in\nterms of natural and moral evils.\nWe obtain as the final equation,\n1 \u2212 t = yz + 0\n0 y(1 \u2212 z) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y)z + (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z).\nThe direct interpretation of this equation is a necessary truth, but the reverse\ninterpretation is remarkable. Evils which are both natural and moral, and evils\nwhich are neither natural nor moral, are not absolute evils.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 163\nThis conclusion, though it may not express a truth, is certainly involved in\nthe given premises, as formally stated.\n15. Let us take from the same argument a somewhat fuller system of\npremises, and let us in those premises suppose that the particles, either, or, are\nnot absolutely disjunctive, so that in the meaning of the expression, \u201ceither evil\nof imperfection, or natural evil, or moral evil,\u201d we include whatever possesses\none or more of these qualities.\nLet the premises be \u2014\n1. All evil (w) is either evil of imperfection (x), or natural evil (y), or moral\nevil (z).\n2. Evil of imperfection (x) is not absolute evil (t).\n3. Natural evil (y) is either a consequence of evil of imperfection (p), or it\nis compensated with greater good (q), or it is a consequence of moral evil (r).\n4. Whatever is a consequence of evil of imperfection (p) is not absolute evil\n(t).\n5. Whatever is compensated with greater good (q) is not absolute evil (t).\n6. Moral evil (z) is a consequence of the abuse of liberty (u).\n7. That which is a consequence of moral evil (r) is a consequence of the\nabuse of liberty (u).\n8. Absolute evils are included in reputed evils.\nThe premises expressed in the usual way give, after the elimination of the\nindefinite symbols v, the following equations:\nw(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = 0, (1)\nxt = 0, (2)\ny(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 r) = 0, (3)\npt = 0, (4)\nqt = 0, (5)\nz(1 \u2212 u) = 0, (6)\nr(1 \u2212 u) = 0, (7)\nt(1 \u2212 w) = 0. (8)\nEach of these equations satisfies the condition V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nThe following results are easily deduced \u2014\nNatural evil is either absolute evil, which is a consequence of moral evil, or\nit is not absolute evil at all.\nAll evils are either absolute evils, which are consequences of the abuse of\nliberty, or they are not absolute evils.\nNatural evils are either evils of imperfection, which are not absolute evils, or\nthey are not evils of imperfection at all.\nAbsolute evils are either natural evils, which are consequences of the abuse\nof liberty, or they are not natural evils, and at the same time not evils of\nimperfection.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 164\nConsequences of the abuse of liberty include all natural evils which are\nabsolute evils, and are not evils of imperfection, with an indefinite remainder\nof natural evils which are not absolute, and of evils which are not natural.\n16. These examples will suffice for illustration. The reader can easily supply\nothers if they are needed. We proceed now to examine the most essential\nportions of the demonstration of Spinoza.\ndefinitions.\n1. By a cause of itself (causa sui), I understand that of which the essence\ninvolves existence, or that of which the nature cannot be conceived except as\nexisting.\n2. That thing is said to be finite or bounded in its own kind (in suo genere\nfinita) which may be bounded by another thing of the same kind; e. g. Body is\nsaid to be finite, because we can always conceive of another body greater than\na given one. So thought is bounded by other thought. But body is not bounded\nby thought, nor thought by body.\n3. By substance, I understand that which is in itself (in se), and is conceived\nby itself (per se concipitur), i.e., that whose conception does not require to be\nformed from the conception of another thing.\n4. By attribute, I understand that which the intellect perceives in substance,\nas constituting its very essence.\n5. By mode, I understand the affections of substance, or that which is in\nanother thing, by which thing also it is conceived.\n6. By God, I understand the Being absolutely infinite, that is the substance\nconsisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses an eternal and infinite\nessence.\nExplanation.\u2014I say absolutely infinite, not infinite in its own kind. For to\nwhatever is only infinite in its own kind we may deny the possession of (some)\ninfinite attributes. But when a thing is absolutely infinite, whatsoever expresses\nessence and involves no negation belongs to its essence.\n7. That thing is termed free, which exists by the sole necessity of its\nown nature, and is determined to action by itself alone; necessary, or rather\nconstrained, which is determined by another thing to existence and action, in a\ncertain and determinate manner.\n8. By eternity, I understand existence itself, in so far as it is conceived\nnecessarily to follow from the sole definition of the eternal thing.\nExplanation.\u2014For such existence, as an eternal truth, is conceived as the\nessence of the thing, and therefore cannot be explained by mere duration or\ntime, though the latter should be conceived as without beginning and without\nend.\naxioms.\n1. All things which exist are either in themselves in se or in another thing.\n2. That which cannot be conceived by another thing ought to be conceived\nby itself.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 165\n3. From a given determinate cause the effect necessarily follows, and,\ncontrariwise, if no determinate cause be granted, it is impossible that an effect\nshould follow.\n4. The knowledge of the effect depends upon, and involves, the knowledge\nof the cause.\n5. Things which have nothing in common cannot be understood by means\nof each other; or the conception of the one does not involve the conception of\nthe other.\n6. A true idea ought to agree with its own object. (Idea vera debet cum suo\nideato convenire.)\n7. Whatever can be conceived as non-existing does not involve existence in its\nessence. Other definitions are implied, and other axioms are virtually assumed,\nin some of the demonstrations. Thus, in Prop. I., \u201cSubstance is prior in nature\nto its affections,\u201d the proof of which consists in a mere reference to Defs. 3\nand 5, there seems to be an assumption of the following axiom, viz., \u201cThat by\nwhich a thing is conceived is prior in nature to the thing conceived.\u201d Again,\nin the demonstration of Prop. V. the converse of this axiom is assumed to be\ntrue. Many other examples of the same kind occur. It is impossible, therefore,\nby the mere processes of Logic, to deduce the whole of the conclusions of the\nfirst book of the Ethics from the axioms and definitions which are prefixed to\nit, and which are given above. In the brief analysis which will follow, I shall\nendeavour to present in their proper order what appear to me to be the real\npremises, whether formally stated or implied, and shall show in what manner\nthey involve the conclusions to which Spinoza was led.\n17. I conceive, then, that in the course of his demonstration, Spinoza effects\nseveral parallel divisions of the universe of possible existence, as,\n1st. Into things which are in themselves, x, and things which are in some\nother thing, x\u2032; whence, as these classes of thing together make up the universe,\nwe have\nx + x\u2032 = 1; (Ax. i.)\nor, x = 1 \u2212 x\u2032.\n2nd. Into things which are conceived by themselves, y, and things which are\nconceived through some other thing,y\u2032; whence\ny = 1 \u2212 y\u2032. (Ax. ii)\n3rd. Into substance, z, and modes, z\u2032; whence\nz = 1 \u2212 z\u2032. (Def. iii. v.)\n4th. Into things free, f , and things necessary,f \u2032; whence\nf = 1 \u2212 f \u2032. (Def. vii.)\n5th. Into things which are causes and self-existent, e, and things caused by\nsome other thing, e\u2032; whence\ne = 1 \u2212 e\u2032. (Def. i. Ax. vii.)\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 166\nAnd his reasoning proceeds upon the expressed or assumed principle, that these\ndivisions are not only parallel, but equivalent. Thus in Def. iii., Substance is\nmade equivalent with that which is conceived by itself; whence\nz = y.\nAgain, Ax. iv., as it is actually applied by Spinoza, establishes the identity of\ncause with that by which a thing is conceived; whence\ny = e.\nAgain, in Def. vii., things free are identified with things self-existent; whence\nf = e.\nLastly, in Def. v mode is made identical with that which is in another thing;\nwhence z\u2032 = x\u2032, and therefore,\nz = x.\nAll these results may be collected together into the following series of equations,\nviz.:\nx = y = z = f = e = 1 \u2212 x\u2032 = 1 \u2212 y\u2032 = 1 \u2212 f \u2032 = 1 \u2212 z\u2032 = 1 \u2212 e\u2032.\nAnd any two members of this series connected together by the sign of equality\nexpress a conclusion, whether drawn by Spinoza or not, which is a legitimate\nconsequence of his system. Thus the equation\nz = 1 \u2212 e\u2032,\nexpresses the sixth proposition of his system, viz., One substance cannot be\nproduced by another. Similarly the equation\nz = e,\nexpresses his seventh proposition, viz., \u201cIt pertains to the nature of substance\nto exist.\u201d This train of deduction it is unnecessary to pursue. Spinoza applies\nit chiefly to the deduction according to his views of the properties of the Divine\nNature, having first endeavoured to prove that the only substance is God. In the\nsteps of this process, there appear to me to exist some fallacies, dependent chiefly\nupon the ambiguous use of words, to which it will be necessary here to direct\nattention. 18. In Prop. v. it is endeavoured to show, that \u201cThere cannot exist\ntwo or more substances of the same nature or attribute.\u201d The proof is virtually\nas follows: If there are more substances than one, they are distinguished either\nby attributes or modes; if by attributes, then there is only one substance of\nthe same attribute; if by modes, then, laying aside these as non-essential, there\nremains no real ground of distinction. Hence there exists but one substance\nof the same attribute. The assumptions here involved are inconsistent with\nthose which are found in other parts of the treatise. Thus substance, Def. iv.,\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 167\nis apprehended by the intellect through the means of attribute. By Def. vi.\nit may have many attributes. One substance may, therefore, conceivably be\ndistinguished from another by a difference in some of its attributes, while others\nremain the same.\nIn Prop. viii. it is attempted to show that, All substance is necessarily\ninfinite. The proof is as follows. There exists but one substance, of one attribute,\nProp. v.; and it pertains to its nature to exist, Prop. vii. It will, therefore,\nbe of its nature to exist either as finite or infinite. But not as finite, for, by\nDef. ii. it would require to be bounded by another substance of the same nature,\nwhich also ought to exist necessarily, Prop. vii. Therefore, there would be two\nsubstances of the same attribute, which is absurd, Prop. v. Substance, therefore,\nis infinite.\nIn this demonstration the word \u201cfinite\u201d is confounded with the expression,\n\u201cFinite in its own kind,\u201d Def. ii. It is thus assumed that nothing can be finite,\nunless it is bounded by another thing of the same kind. This is not consistent\nwith the ordinary meaning of the term. Spinoza\u2019s use of the term finite tends to\nmake space the only form of substance, and all existing things but affections of\nspace, and this, I think, is really one of the ultimate foundations of his system.\nThe first scholium applied to the above Proposition is remarkable. I give\nit in the original words: \u201cQuum finitum esse revera sit ex parte negatio, et\ninfinitum absoluta affirmatio existentiae alicujus naturae, sequitur ergo ex sola\nProp. vii. omnem substantiam debere esse infinitam.\u201d Now this is in reality an\nassertion of the principle affirmed by Clarke, and controverted by\nButler (XIII. 11), that necessary existence implies existence in every part of\nspace. Probably this principle will be found to lie at the basis of every attempt\nto demonstrate, `a priori, the existence of an Infinite Being.\nFrom the general properties of substance above stated, and the definition\nof God as the substance consisting of infinite attributes, the peculiar doctrines\nof Spinoza relating to the Divine Nature necessarily follow. As substance is\nself-existent, free, causal in its very nature, the thing in which other things\nare, and by which they are conceived; the same properties are also asserted\nof the Deity. He is self-existent, Prop. xi.; indivisible, Prop. xiii.; the only\nsubstance, Prop. xiv.; the Being in which all things are, and by which all things\nare conceived, Prop. xv.; free, Prop. xvii.; the immanent cause of all things,\nProp. xviii. The proof that God is the only substance is drawn from Def. vi.,\nwhich is interpreted into a declaration that \u201cGod is the Being absolutely infinite,\nof whom no attribute which expresses the essence of substance can be denied.\u201d\nEvery conceivable attribute being thus assigned by definition to Him, and it\nbeing determined in Prop. v. that there cannot exist two substances of the\nsame attribute, it follows that God is the only substance.\nThough the \u201cEthics\u201d of Spinoza, like a large portion of his other writings,\nis presented in the geometrical form, it does not afford a good praxis for the\nsymbolical method of this work. Of course every train of reasoning admits, when\nits ultimate premises are truly determined, of being treated by that method;\nbut in the present instance, such treatment scarcely differs, except in the use of\nletters for words, from the processes employed in the original demonstrations.\nCHAPTER XIII. CLARKE AND SPINOZA 168\nReasoning which consists so largely of a play upon terms defined as equivalent,\nis not often met with; and it is rather on account of the interest attaching to\nthe subject, than of the merits of the demonstrations, highly as by some they\nare esteemed, that I have devoted a few pages here to their exposition.\n19. It is not possible, I think, to rise from the perusal of the arguments of\nClarke and Spinoza without a deep conviction of the futility of all endeavours to\nestablish, entirely `a priori, the existence of an Infinite Being, His attributes, and\nHis relation to the universe. The fundamental principle of all such speculations,\nviz., that whatever we can clearly conceive, must exist, fails to accomplish its\nend, even when its truth is admitted. For how shall the finite comprehend\nthe infinite? Yet must the possibility of such conception be granted, and\nin something more than the sense of a mere withdrawal of the limits of\nphaenomenal existence, before any solid ground can be established for the\nknowledge, `a priori, of things infinite and eternal. Spinoza\u2019s affirmation of the\nreality of such knowledge is plain and explicit: \u201cMens humana adaequatum\nhabet cognitionem aeternae et infinitae essentiae Dei\u201d (Prop. xlvii., Part 2nd).\nLet this be compared with Prop. xxxiv., Part 2nd: \u201cOmnis idea quae in\nnobis est absoluta sive adaequata et perfecta, vera est;\u201d and with Axiom vi.,\nPart 1st, \u201cIdea vera debet cum suo ideato convenire.\u201d Moreover, this species\nof knowledge is made the essential constituent of all other knowledge: \u201cDe\nnatura rationis est res sub quadam aeternitatis specie percipere\u201d (Prop. xliv.,\nCor. ii., Part 2nd). Were it said, that there is a tendency in the human mind\nto rise in contemplation from the particular towards the universal, from the\nfinite towards the infinite, from the transient towards the eternal; and that this\ntendency suggests to us, with high probability, the existence of more than sense\nperceives or understanding comprehends; the statement might be accepted\nas true for at least a large number of minds. There is, however, a class of\nspeculations, the character of which must be explained in part by reference to\nother causes,\u2014impatience of probable or limited knowledge, so often all that we\ncan really attain to; a desire for absolute certainty where intimations sufficient\nto mark out before us the path of duty, but not to satisfy the demands of the\nspeculative intellect, have alone been granted to us; perhaps, too, dissatisfaction\nwith the present scene of things. With the undue predominance of these motives,\nthe more sober procedure of analogy and probable induction falls into neglect.\nYet the latter is, beyond all question, the course most adapted to our present\ncondition. To infer the existence of an intelligent cause from the teeming\nevidences of surrounding design, to rise to the conception of a moral Governor\nof the world, from the study of the constitution and the moral provisions of our\nown nature;\u2013 these, though but the feeble steps of an understanding limited in\nits faculties and its materials of knowledge, are of more avail than the ambitious\nattempt to arrive at a certainty unattainable on the ground of natural religion.\nAnd as these were the most ancient, so are they still the most solid foundations,\nRevelation being set apart, of the belief that the course of this world is not\nabandoned to chance and inexorable fate.\nChapter XIV\nEXAMPLE OF THE ANALYSIS OF A SYSTEM OF\nEQUATIONS BY THE METHOD OF REDUCTION TO\nA SINGLE EQUIVALENT EQUATION V = 0,\nWHEREIN V SATISFIES THE CONDITION\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\n1. Let us take the remarkable system of premises employed in the previous\nChapter, to prove that \u201cMatter is not a necessary being;\u201d and suppressing the\n6th premiss, viz., Motion exists,\u2014examine some of the consequences which flow\nfrom the remaining premises. This is in reality to accept as true Dr. Clarke\u2019s\nhypothetical principles; but to suppose ourselves ignorant of the fact of the\nexistence of motion. Instances may occur in which such a selection of a portion\nof the premises of an argument may lead to interesting consequences, though it\nis with other views that the present example has been resumed. The premises\nactually employed will be\u2014\n1. If matter is a necessary being, either the property of gravitation is\nnecessarily present, or it is necessarily absent.\n2. If gravitation is necessarily absent, and the world is not subject to any\npresiding intelligence, motion does not exist.\n3. If gravitation is necessarily present, a vacuum is necessary.\n4. If a vacuum is necessary, matter is not a necessary being.\n5. If matter is a necessary being, the world is not subject to a presiding\nintelligence.\nIf, as before, we represent the elementary propositions by the following\nnotation, viz.:\nx = Matter is a necessary being.\ny = Gravitation is necessarily present.\nw = Motion exists.\nt = Gravitation is necessarily absent.\nz = The world is merely material, and not subject to a presiding intelligence.\nv = A vacuum is necessary.\n169\nCHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 170\nWe shall on expression of the premises and elimination of the indefinite class\nsymbols (q), obtain the following system of equations:\nxyt + x\u00afy\u00aft = 0,\ntzw = 0,\ny\u00afv = 0,\nvx = 0,\nx\u00afz = 0;\nin which for brevity \u00afy stands for 1 \u2212 y, \u00aft for 1 \u2212 t, and so on; whence, also,\n1 \u2212 \u00aft = t, 1 \u2212 \u00afy = y, &c.\nAs the first members of these equations involve only positive terms, we can\nform a single equation by adding them together (VIII. Prop. 2), viz.:\nxyt + x\u00afy\u00aft + y\u00afv + vx + x\u00afz + tzw = 0,\nand it remains to reduce the first member so as to cause it to satisfy the condition\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0.\nFor this purpose we will first obtain its development with reference to the\nsymbols x and y. The result is\u2014\n(t + \u00afv + v + \u00afz + tzw)xy + (\u00aft + v + \u00afz + tzw)x\u00afy\n+(\u00afv + tzw)\u00afxy + tzw\u00afx\u00afy = 0.\nAnd our object will be accomplished by reducing the four coefficients of the\ndevelopment to equivalent forms, themselves satisfying the condition required.\nNow the first coefficient is, since v + \u00afv = 1,\n1 + t + \u00afz + tzw,\nwhich reduces to unity (IX. Prop. 1).\nThe second coefficient is\n\u00aft + v + \u00afz + tzw;\nand its reduced form (X. 3) is\n\u00aft + tv + t\u00afv\u00afz + t\u00afvzw.\nThe third coefficient, \u00afv + tzw, reduces by the same method to \u00afv + tzwv; and\nthe last coefficient tzw needs no reduction. Hence the development becomes\nxy + (\u00aft + tv + t\u00afv\u00afz + t\u00afvzw) x\u00afy + (\u00afv + tzwv) \u00afxy + tzw\u00afx\u00afy = 0; (1)\nand this is the form of reduction sought.\n2. Now according to the principle asserted in Prop. iii., Chap. x., the whole\nrelation connecting any particular set of the symbols in the above equation may\nbe deduced by developing that equation with reference to the particular symbols\nCHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 171\nin question, and retaining in the result only those constituents whose coefficients\nare unity. Thus, if x and y are the symbols chosen, we are immediately\nconducted to the equation\nxy = 0,\nwhence we have\ny = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x),\nwith the interpretation, If gravitation is necessarily present, matter is not a\nnecessary being.\nLet us next seek the relation between x and w. Developing (1) with respect\nto those symbols, we get\n(y + \u00aft\u00afy + tv \u00afy + t\u00afv\u00afz \u00afy + t\u00afvz \u00afy) xw + (y + \u00aft\u00afy + tv \u00afy + t\u00afv\u00afz \u00afy) x \u00afw\n+ (\u00afvy + tzvy + tz \u00afy) \u00afxw + \u00afvy \u00afxw = 0.\nThe coefficient of xw, and it alone, reduces to unity. For t\u00afv\u00afz \u00afy + t\u00afvz \u00afy = t\u00afv \u00afy, and\ntv \u00afy + t\u00afv \u00afy = t\u00afy, and \u00aft\u00afy + t\u00afy = \u00afy, and lastly, y + \u00afy = 1. This is always the mode\nin which such reductions take place. Hence we get\nxw = 0,\n\u2234 w = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x),\nof which the interpretation is, If motion exists, matter is not a necessary being.\nIf, in like manner, we develop (1) with respect to x and z, we get the equation\nx\u00afz = 0,\n\u2234 x = 0\n0 z,\nwith the interpretation, If matter is a necessary being, the world is merely\nmaterial, and without a presiding intelligence.\nThis, indeed, is only the fifth premiss reproduced, but it shows that there is\nno other relation connecting the two elements which it involves.\nIf we seek the whole relation connecting the elements x, w, and y, we find,\non developing (1) with reference to those symbols, and proceeding as before,\nxy + xw\u00afy = 0.\nSuppose it required to determine hence the consequences of the hypothesis,\n\u201cMotion does not exist,\u201d relatively to the questions of the necessity of matter,\nand the necessary presence of gravitation. We find\nw = \u2212xy\nx\u00afy ,\n\u2234 1 \u2212 w = x\nx\u00afy = 1\n0 xy + x\u00afy + 0\n0 \u00afx;\nor, 1 \u2212 w = x\u00afy + 0\n0 \u00afx, with xy = 0.\nCHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 172\nThe direct interpretation of the first equation is, If motion does not exist, either\nmatter is a necessary being, and gravitation is not necessarily present, or matter\nis not a necessary being.\nThe reverse interpretation is, If matter is a necessary being, and gravitation\nnot necessary, motion does not exist.\nIn exactly the same mode, if we sought the full relation between x, z, and\nw, we should find\nxzw + x\u00afz = 0.\nFrom this we may deduce\nz = x \u00afw + 0\n0 \u00afx, with xw = 0.\nTherefore, If the world is merely material, and not subject to any presiding\nintelligence, either matter is a necessary being, and motion does not exist, or\nmatter is not a necessary being.\nAlso, reversely, If matter is a necessary being, and there is no such thing as\nmotion, the world is merely material.\n3. We might, of course, extend the same method to the determination of\nthe consequences of any complex hypothesis u, such as, \u201cThe world is merely\nmaterial, and without any presiding intelligence (z), but motion exists\u201d (w),\nwith reference to any other elements of doubt or speculation involved in the\noriginal premises, such as, \u201cMatter is a necessary being\u201d (x), \u201cGravitation is a\nnecessary quality of matter,\u201d (y). We should, for this purpose, connect with the\ngeneral equation (1) a new equation,\nu = wz,\nreduce the system thus formed to a single equation, V = 0, in which V satisfies\nthe condition V (1 \u2212 V ) = 0, and proceed as above to determine the relation\nbetween u, x, and y, and finally u as a developed function of x and y. But\nit is very much better to adopt the methods of Chapters viii. and ix. I shall\nhere simply indicate a few results, with the leading steps of their deduction, and\nleave their verification to the reader\u2019s choice.\nIn the problem last mentioned we find, as the relation connecting x, y, w,\nand z,\nxw + x \u00afwy + x \u00afw\u00afy\u00afz = 0.\nAnd if we write u = xy, and then eliminate the symbols x and y by the general\nproblem, Chap. ix., we find\nxu + xy\u00afu = 0,\nwhence\nu = 1\n0 xy + 0x\u00afy + 0\n0 \u00afx;\nwherefore\nwz = 0\n0 \u00afx with xy = 0.\nCHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 173\nHence, If the world is merely material, and without a presiding intelligence, and\nat the same time motion exists, matter is not a necessary being.\nNow it has before been shown that if motion exists, matter is not a necessary\nbeing, so that the above conclusion tells us even less than we had before\nascertained to be (inferentially) true. Nevertheless, that conclusion is the\nproper and complete answer to the question which was proposed, which was,\nto determine simply the consequences of a certain complex hypothesis. 4. It\nwould thus be easy, even from the limited system of premises before us, to\ndeduce a great variety of additional inferences, involving, in the conditions\nwhich are given, any proposed combinations of the elementary propositions. If\nthe condition is one which is inconsistent with the premises, the fact will be\nindicated by the form of the solution. The value which the method will assign\nto the combination of symbols expressive of the proposed condition will be\n0. If, on the other hand, the fulfilment of the condition in question imposes\nno restriction upon the propositions among which relation is sought, so that\nevery combination of those propositions is equally possible,\u2014the fact will also\nbe indicated by the form of the solution. Examples of each of these cases are\nsubjoined.\nIf in the ordinary way we seek the consequences which would flow from the\ncondition that matter is a necessary being, and at the same time that motion\nexists, as affecting the Propositions, The world is merely material, and without\na presiding intelligence, and, Gravitation is necessarily present, we shall obtain\nthe equation\nxw = 0,\nwhich indicates that the condition proposed is inconsistent with the premises,\nand therefore cannot be fulfilled.\nIf we seek the consequences which would flow from the condition that\nMatter is not a necessary being, and at the same time that Motion does exist,\nwith reference to the same elements as above, viz., the absence of a presiding\nintelligence, and the necessity of gravitation,\u2013we obtain the following result,\n(1 \u2212 x)w = 0\n0 yz + 0\n0 y(1 \u2212 z) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y)z + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z),\nwhich might literally be interpreted as follows:\nIf matter is not a necessary being, and motion exists, then either the world\nis merely material and without a presiding intelligence, and gravitation is\nnecessary, or one of these two results follows without the other, or they both fail\nof being true. Wherefore of the four possible combinations, of which some one\nis true of necessity, and of which of necessity one only can be true, it is affirmed\nthat any one may be true. Such a result is a truism\u2014 a mere necessary truth.\nStill it contains the only answer which can be given to the question proposed.\nI do not deem it necessary to vindicate against the charge of laborious trifling\nthese applications. It may be requisite to enter with some fulness into details\nuseless in themselves, in order to establish confidence in general principles and\nmethods. When this end shall have been accomplished in the subject of the\nCHAPTER XIV. EXAMPLE OF ANALYSIS 174\npresent inquiry, let all that has contributed to its attainment, but has afterwards\nbeen found superfluous, be forgotten.\nChapter XV\nTHE ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC AND ITS MODERN\nEXTENSIONS, EXAMINED BY THE METHOD OF\nTHIS TREATISE.\n1. The logical system of Aristotle, modified in its details, but unchanged in its\nessential features, occupies so important a place in academical education, that\nsome account of its nature, and some brief discussion of the leading problems\nwhich it presents, seem to be called for in the present work. It is, I trust, in no\nnarrow or harshly critical spirit that I approach this task. My object, indeed,\nis not to institute any direct comparison between the time-honoured system of\nthe schools and that of the present treatise; but, setting truth above all other\nconsiderations, to endeavour to exhibit the real nature of the ancient doctrine,\nand to remove one or two prevailing misapprehensions respecting its extent and\nsufficiency.\nThat which may be regarded as essential in the spirit and procedure of the\nAristotelian, and of all cognate systems of Logic, is the attempted classification\nof the allowable forms of inference, and the distinct reference of those forms,\ncollectively or individually, to some general principle of an axiomatic nature,\nsuch as the \u201cdictum of Aristotle:\u201d Whatsoever is affirmed or denied of the genus\nmay in the same sense be affirmed or denied of any species included under that\ngenus. Concerning such general principles it may, I think, be observed, that\nthey either state directly, but in an abstract form, the argument which they\nare supposed to elucidate, and, so stating that argument, affirm its validity; or\ninvolve in their expression technical terms which, after definition, conduct us\nagain to the same point, viz., the abstract statement of the supposed allowable\nforms of inference. The idea of classification is thus a pervading element in those\nsystems. Furthermore, they exhibit Logic as resolvable into two great branches,\nthe one of which is occupied with the treatment of categorical, the other with\nthat of hypothetical or conditional propositions. The distinction is nearly\nidentical with that of primary and secondary propositions in the present work.\nThe discussion of the theory of categorical propositions is, in all the ordinary\ntreatises of Logic, much more full and elaborate than that of hypothetical\npropositions, and is occupied partly with ancient scholastic distinctions, partly\nwith the canons of deductive inference. To the latter application only is it\n175\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 176\nnecessary to direct attention here.\n2. Categorical propositions are classed under the four following heads, viz.:\ntype\n1st. Universal affirmative Propositions: All Y \u2019s are X\u2019s.\n2nd. Universal negative \u201d No Y \u2019s are X\u2019s.\n3rd. Particular affirmative \u201d Some Y \u2019s are X\u2019s.\n4th. Particular negative \u201d Some Y \u2019s are not X\u2019s.\nTo these forms, four others have recently been added, so as to constitute in\nthe whole eight forms (see the next article) susceptible, however, of reduction\nto six, and subject to relations which have been discussed with great fulness\nand ability by Professor De Morgan, in his Formal Logic. A scheme somewhat\ndifferent from the above has been given to the world by Sir W. Hamilton, and\nis made the basis of a method of syllogistic inference, which is spoken of with\nvery high respect by authorities on the subject of Logic.1\nThe processes of Formal Logic, in relation to the above system of propositions,\nare described as of two kinds, viz., \u201cConversion\u201d and \u201cSyllogism.\u201d By\nConversion is meant the expression of any proposition of the above kind in\nan equivalent form, but with a reversed order of terms. By Syllogism is meant\nthe deduction from two such propositions having a common term, whether\nsubject or predicate, of some third proposition inferentially involved in the two,\nand forming the \u201cconclusion.\u201d It is maintained by most writers on Logic, that\nthese processes, and according to some, the single process of Syllogism, furnish\nthe universal types of reasoning, and that it is the business of the mind, in any\ntrain of demonstration, to conform itself, whether consciously or unconsciously,\nto the particular models of the processes which have been classified in the\nwritings of logicians.\n3. The course which I design to pursue is to show how these processes of\nSyllogism and Conversion may be conducted in the most general manner upon\nthe principles of the present treatise, and, viewing them thus in relation to a\nsystem of Logic, the foundations of which, it is conceived, have been laid in the\nultimate laws of thought, to seek to determine their true place and essential\ncharacter.\nThe expressions of the eight fundamental types of proposition in the language\nof symbols are as follows:\n1. All Y \u2019s are X\u2019s, y = vx.\n2. No Y \u2019s are X\u2019s, y = v(1 \u2212 x).\n3. Some Y \u2019s are X\u2019s, vy = vx.\n4. Some Y \u2019s are not-X\u2019s, vy = v(1 \u2212 x).\n5. All not-Y \u2019s are X\u2019s, 1 \u2212 y = vx. (1)\n6. No not-Y \u2019s are X\u2019s, 1 \u2212 y = v(l \u2212 x).\n7. Some not-Y \u2019s are X\u2019s, v(l \u2212 y) = vx.\n8. Some not-Y \u2019s are not-X\u2019s,v(1 \u2212 y) = v(1 \u2212 x).\n1Thomson\u2019s Outlines of the Laws of Thought, p. 177.\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 177\nIn referring to these forms, it will be convenient to apply, in a sense shortly to\nbe explained, the epithets of logical quantity, \u201cuniversal\u201d and \u201cparticular,\u201d and\nof quality, \u201caffirmative\u201d and \u201cnegative,\u201d to the terms of propositions, and not\nto the propositions themselves. We shall thus consider the term \u201cAll Y \u2019s,\u201d as\nuniversal-affirmative; the term \u201cY \u2019s,\u201d or \u201cSome Y \u2019s,\u201d as particular-affirmative;\nthe term \u201cAll not-Y \u2019s,\u201d as universal-negative; the term \u201cSome not-Y \u2019s,\u201d as\nparticular-negative. The expression \u201cNo Y \u2019s,\u201d is not properly a term of a\nproposition, for the true meaning of the proposition, \u201cNo Y \u2019s are X\u2019s,\u201d is\n\u201cAll Y \u2019s are not-X\u2019s.\u201d The subject of that proposition is, therefore, universal-\naffirmative, the predicate particular-negative. That there is a real distinction\nbetween the conceptions of \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cnot men\u201d is manifest. This distinction\nis all that I contemplate when applying as above the designations of affirmative\nand negative, without, however, insisting upon the etymological propriety of the\napplication to the terms of propositions. The designations positive anil privative\nwould have been more appropriate, but the former term is already employed in\na fixed sense in other parts of this work.\n4. From the symbolical forms above given the laws of conversion immediately\nfollow. Thus from the equation\ny = vx,\nrepresenting the proposition, \u201cAll Y \u2019s are X\u2019s,\u201d we deduce, on eliminating v,\ny(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nwhich gives by solution with reference to 1 \u2212 x,\n1 \u2212 x = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y);\nthe interpretation of which is,\nAll not-X\u2019s are not-Y \u2019s.\nThis is an example of what is called \u201cnegative conversion.\u201d In like manner,\nthe equation\ny = v(1 \u2212 x),\nrepresenting the proposition, \u201cNo Y \u2019s are X\u2019s,\u201d gives\nx = 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y),\nthe interpretation of which is, \u201cNo X\u2019s are Y \u2019s.\u201d This is an example of what\nis termed simple conversion; though it is in reality of the same kind as the\nconversion exhibited in the previous example. All the examples of conversion\nwhich have been noticed by logicians are either of the above kind, or of that\nwhich consists in the mere transposition of the terms of a proposition, without\naltering their quality, as when we change\nvy = vx, representing, Some Y \u2019s are X\u2019s,\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 178\ninto\nvx = vy, representing, Some X\u2019s are Y \u2019s;\nor they involve a combination of those processes with some auxiliary process of\nlimitation, as when from the equation\ny = vx, representing, All Y \u2019s are X\u2019s,\nwe deduce on multiplication by v,\nvy = vx, representing, Some Y \u2019s are X\u2019s,\nand hence\nvx = vy, representing, Some X\u2019s are Y \u2019s.\nIn this example, the process of limitation precedes that of transposition.\nFrom these instances it is seen that conversion is a particular application of\na much more general process in Logic, of which many examples have been given\nin this work. That process has for its object the determination of any element\nin any proposition, however complex, as a logical function of the remaining\nelements. Instead of confining our attention to the subject and predicate,\nregarded as simple terms, we can take any element or any combination of\nelements entering into either of them; make that element, or that combination,\nthe \u201csubject\u201d of a new proposition; and determine what its predicate shall be,\nin accordance with the data afforded to us. It may be remarked, that even\nthe simple forms of propositions enumerated above afford some ground for the\napplication of such a method, beyond what the received laws of conversion\nappear to recognise. Thus the equation\ny = vx, representing, All Y \u2019s are X\u2019s,\ngives us, in addition to the proposition before deduced, the three following:\n1st. y(1 \u2212 x) = 0. There are no Y \u2019s that are not-X\u2019s.\n2nd. 1 \u2212 y = 0\n0 x + (1 \u2212 x). Things that are not-Y \u2019s include all\nthings that are not-X\u2019s, and an\nindefinite remainder of things\nthat are X\u2019s.\n3rd. x = y + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 y). Things that are X\u2019s include all things\nthat are Y \u2019s, and an indefinite\nremainder of things that are not-\nY \u2019s.\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 179\nThese conclusions, it is true, merely place the given proposition in other and\nequivalent forms,\u2013but such and no more is the office of the received mode of\n\u201cnegative conversion.\u201d\nFurthermore, these processes of conversion are not elementary, but they are\ncombinations of processes more simple than they, more immediately dependent\nupon the ultimate laws and axioms which govern the use of the symbolical\ninstrument of reasoning. This remark is equally applicable to the case of\nSyllogism, which we proceed next to consider.\n5. The nature of syllogism is best seen in the particular instance. Suppose\nthat we have the propositions,\nAll X\u2019s are Y \u2019s,\nAll Y \u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nFrom these we may deduce the conclusion,\nAll X\u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nThis is a syllogistic inference. The terms X and Z are called the extremes, and\nY is called the middle term. The function of the syllogism generally may now\nbe defined. Given two propositions of the kind whose species are tabulated in\n(1), and involving one middle or common term Y , which is connected in one of\nthe propositions with an extreme X, in the other with an extreme Z; required\nthe relation connecting the extremes X and Z. The term Y may appear in its\naffirmative form, as, All Y \u2019s, Some Y \u2019s; or in its negative form, as, All not-Y \u2019s,\nSome not-Y \u2019s; in either proposition, without regard to the particular form which\nit assumes in the other.\nNothing is easier than in particular instances to resolve the Syllogism by the\nmethod of this treatise. Its resolution is, indeed, a particular application of the\nprocess for the reduction of systems of propositions. Taking the examples above\ngiven, we have,\nx = vy,\ny = v\u2032z;\nwhence by substitution,\nx = vv\u2032z,\nwhich is interpreted into\nAll X\u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nOr, proceeding rigorously in accordance with the method developed in (VIII.7),\nwe deduce\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0, y(1 \u2212 z) = 0.\nAdding these equations, and eliminating y, we have\nx(1 \u2212 z) = 0;\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 180\nwhence x = 0\n0 z, or, All X\u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nAnd in the same way may any other case be treated.\n6. Quitting, however, the consideration of special examples, let us examine\nthe general forms to which all syllogism may be reduced.\nProposition I.\nTo deduce the general rules of Syllogism.\nBy the general rules of Syllogism, I here mean the rules applicable to premises\nadmitting of every variety both of quantity and of quality in their subjects\nand predicates, except the combination of two universal terms in the same\nproposition. The admissible forms of propositions are therefore those of which\na tabular view is given in (1).\nLet X and Y be the elements or things entering into the first premiss, Z and\nY those involved in the second. Two cases, fundamentally different in character,\nwill then present themselves. The terms involving Y will either be of like or\nof unlike quality, those terms being regarded as of like quality when they both\nspeak of \u201cY \u2019s,\u201d or both of \u201cNot-Y \u2019s,\u201d as of unlike quality when one of them\nspeaks of \u201cY \u2019s,\u201d and the other of \u201cNot-Y \u2019s.\u201d Any pair of premises, in which the\nformer condition is satisfied, may be represented by the equations\nvx = v\u2032y, (1)\nwz = w\u2032y; (2)\nfor we can employ the symbol y to represent either \u201cAll Y \u2019s,\u201d or \u201cAll not-Y \u2019s,\u201d\nsince the interpretation of the symbol is purely conventional. If we employ y\nin the sense of \u201cAll not-Y \u2019s,\u201d then 1 \u2212 y will represent \u201cAll Y \u2019s,\u201d and no other\nchange will be introduced. An equal freedom is permitted with respect to the\nsymbols x and z, so that the equations (1) and (2) may, by properly assigning\nthe interpretations of x, y, and z, be made to represent all varieties in the\ncombination of premises dependent upon the quality of the respective terms.\nAgain, by assuming proper interpretations to the symbols v, v\u2032, w, w\u2032, in those\nequations, all varieties with reference to quantity may also be represented. Thus,\nif we take v = 1, and represent by v\u2032 a class indefinite, the equation (1) will\nrepresent a universal proposition according to the ordinary sense of that term,\ni. e., a proposition with universal subject and particular predicate. We may, in\nfact, give to subject and predicate in either premiss whatever quantities (using\nthis term in the scholastic sense) we please, except that by hypothesis, they\nmust not both be universal. The system (1), (2), represents, therefore, with\nperfect generality, the possible combinations of premises which have like middle\nterms.\n7. That our analysis may be as general as the equations to which it is\napplied, let us, by the method of this work, eliminate y from (1) and (2), and\nseek the expressions for x, 1 \u2212 x, and vx, in terms of z and of the symbols v,\nv\u2032, w, w\u2032. The above will include all the possible forms of the subject of the\nconclusion. The form v(1 \u2212 x) is excluded, inasmuch as we cannot from the\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 181\ninterpretation vx = Some X\u2019s, given in the premises, interpret v(1 \u2212 x) as Some\nnot-X\u2019s. The symbol v, when used in the sense of \u201csome,\u201d applies to that term\nonly with which it is connected in the premises.\nThe results of the analysis are as follows:\nx = \u0002vv\u2032ww\u2032 + 0\n0 {vv\u20321 \u2212 w\u00011 \u2212 w\u2032\u0001 + ww\u20321 \u2212 v\u00011 \u2212 v\u2032\u0001 + 1 \u2212 v\u00011 \u2212 w\u0001}\u0003z\n+ 0\n0 {vv\u20321 \u2212 w\u2032\u0001 + 1 \u2212 v}1 \u2212 z\u0001, (I.)\n1 \u2212 x = \u0002v1 \u2212 v\u2032\u0001{ww\u2032 + 1 \u2212 w\u00011 \u2212 w\u2032\u0001} + v1 \u2212 w\u0001w\u2032\n+ 0\n0 {vv\u20321 \u2212 w\u00011 \u2212 w\u2032\u0001 + ww\u20321 \u2212 v\u00011 \u2212 v\u2032\u0001 + 1 \u2212 v\u00011 \u2212 w\u0001}\u0003z\n+ \u0002v1 \u2212 w\u0001w\u2032 + 0\n0 {vv\u20321 \u2212 w\u2032\u0001 + 1 \u2212 v}\u00031 \u2212 z\u0001, (II.)\nvx = {vv\u2032ww\u2032 + 0\n0 vv\u20321 \u2212 w\u00011 \u2212 w\u2032\u0001}z + 0\n0\n1 \u2212 w\u2032\u00011 \u2212 z\u0001. (III.)\nEach of these expressions involves in its second member two terms, of one\nof which z is a factor, of the other 1 \u2212 z. But syllogistic inference does not, as a\nmatter of form, admit of contrary classes in its conclusion, as of Z\u2019s and not-Z\u2019s\ntogether.\nWe must, therefore, in order to determine the rules of that species of\ninference, ascertain under what conditions the second members of any of our\nequations are reducible to a single term.\nThe simplest form is (III.), and it is reducible to a single term if w\u2032 = 1.\nThe equation then becomes\nvx = vv\u2032wz, (3)\nthe first member is identical with the extreme in the first premiss; the second is\nof the same quantity and quality as the extreme in the second premiss. For since\nw\u2032 = 1, the second member of (2), involving the middle term y, is universal;\ntherefore, by the hypothesis, the first member is particular, and therefore, the\nsecond member of (3), involving the same symbol w in its coefficient, is particular\nalso. Hence we deduce the following law.\nCondition of Inference.\u2014One middle term, at least, universal.\nRule of Inference.\u2014Equate the extremes.\nFrom an analysis of the equations (I.) and (II.), it will further appear, that\nthe above is the only condition of syllogistic inference when the middle terms\nare of like quality. Thus the second member of (I.) reduces to a single term, if\nw\u2032 = 1 and v = 1; and the second member of (II.) reduces to a single term, if\nw\u2032 = 1, v = 1, w = 1. In each of these cases, it is necessary that w\u2032 = 1, the\nsolely sufficient condition before assigned.\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 182\nConsider, secondly, the case in which the middle terms are of unlike quality.\nThe premises may then be represented under the forms\nvx = v\u2032y, (4)\nwz = w\u2032(l \u2212 y); (5)\nand if, as before, we eliminate y, and determine the expressions of x, 1 \u2212 x, and\nvx, we get\nx = \u0002vv\u2032(l \u2212 w)w\u2032 + 0\n0 {ww\u2032(1 \u2212 v) + (1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 v\u2032)(1 \u2212 w)\n+ v\u2032(1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 w\u2032)}\u0003\n+ \u0002vv\u2032w\u2032 + 0\n0 {(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 v\u2032) + v\u2032(l \u2212 w\u2032)}\u0003(1 \u2212 z). (IV.)\n1 \u2212 x =\u0002ww\u2032v + v(1 \u2212 v\u2032)(1 \u2212 w) + 0\n0 {ww\u2032(1 \u2212 v)\n+ (1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 v\u2032)(1 \u2212 w) + v\u2032(1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 w\u2032)}\u0003z\n+ \u0002v(1 \u2212 v\u2032) + 0\n0 {v\u2032(1 \u2212 w\u2032) + (1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 v\u2032)}\u0003(1 \u2212 z). (V.)\nvx = {vv\u2032(1 \u2212 w)w\u2032 + 0\n0 vv\u2032(1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 w\u2032)}z\n+ {vv\u2032w\u2032 + 0\n0 vv\u2032(1 \u2212 w\u2032)}(1 \u2212 z). (VI.)\nNow the second member of (VI.) reduces to a single term relatively to z, if\nw = 1, giving\nvx = {vv\u2032w\u2032 + 0\n0 vv\u2032(1 \u2212 w\u2032)}(1 \u2212 z);\nthe second member of which is opposite, both in quantity and quality, to the\ncorresponding extreme, wz, in the second premiss. For since w = 1, wz is\nuniversal. But the factor vv\u2032 indicates that the term to which it is attached\nis particular, since by hypothesis v and v\u2032 are not both equal to 1. Hence we\ndeduce the following law of inference in the case of like middle terms:\nFirst Condition of Inference.\u2014At least one universal extreme.\nRule of Inference.\u2014Change the quantity and quality of that extreme,\nand equate the result to the other extreme.\nMoreover, the second member of (V.) reduces to a single term if v\u2032 = 1,\nw\u2032 = 1; it then gives\n1 \u2212 x = {vw + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 v)w}z.\nNow since v\u2032 = 1, w\u2032 = 1, the middle terms of the premises are both universal,\ntherefore the extremes vx, wz, are particular. But in the conclusion the extreme\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 183\ninvolving x is opposite, both in quantity and quality, to the extreme vx in the\nfirst premiss, while the extreme involving z agrees both in quantity and quality\nwith the corresponding extreme wz in the second premiss. Hence the following\ngeneral law:\nSecond Condition of Inference.\u2014Two universal middle terms.\nRule of Inference.\u2014Change the quantity and quality of either extreme,\nand equate the result to the other extreme unchanged.\nThere are in the case of unlike middle terms no other conditions or rules of\nsyllogistic inference than the above. Thus the equation (IV.), though reducible\nto the form of a syllogistic conclusion, when w = 1 and v = 1, does not thereby\nestablish a new condition of inference; since, by what has preceded, the single\ncondition v = 1, or w = 1, would suffice.\n8. The following examples will sufficiently illustrate the general rules of\nsyllogism above given:\n1. All Y \u2019s are X\u2019s.\nAll Z\u2019s are Y \u2019s.\nThis belongs to Case 1. All Y \u2019s is the universal middle term. The extremes\nequated give as the conclusion\nAll Z\u2019s are X\u2019s;\nthe universal term, All Z\u2019s, becoming the subject; the particular term (some)\nX\u2019s, the predicate.\n2. All X\u2019s are Y \u2019s.\nNo Z\u2019s are Y \u2019s.\nThe proper expression of these premises is\nAll X\u2019s are Y \u2019s.\nAll Z\u2019s are not-Y \u2019s.\nThey belong to Case 2, and satisfy the first condition of inference. The middle\nterm, Y \u2019s, in the first premiss, is particular-affirmative; that in the second\npremiss, not-Y \u2019s, particular-negative. If we take All Z\u2019s as the universal\nextreme, and change its quantity and quality according to the rule, we obtain\nthe term Some not-Z\u2019s, and this equated with the other extreme, All X\u2019s, gives,\nAll X\u2019s are not-Z\u2019s, i. e., No X\u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nIf we commence with the other universal extreme, and proceed similarly, we\nobtain the equivalent result,\nNo Z\u2019s are X\u2019s.\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 184\n3. All Y \u2019s are X\u2019s.\nAll not-Y \u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nHere also the middle terms are unlike in quality. The premises therefore belong\nto Case 2, and there being two universal middle terms, the second condition of\ninference is satisfied. If by the rule we change the quantity and quality of the\nfirst extreme, (some) X\u2019s, we obtain All not-X\u2019s, which, equated with the other\nextreme, gives\nAll not-X\u2019s are Z\u2019s.\nThe reverse order of procedure would give the equivalent result,\nAll not-Z\u2019s are X\u2019s.\nThe conclusions of the two last examples would not be recognised as valid\nin the scholastic system of Logic, which virtually requires that the subject of\na proposition should be affirmative. They are, however, perfectly legitimate\nin themselves, and the rules by which they are determined form undoubtedly\nthe most general canons of syllogistic inference. The process of investigation\nby which they are deduced will probably appear to be of needless complexity;\nand it is certain that they might have been obtained with greater facility, and\nwithout the aid of any symbolical instrument whatever. It was, however, my\nobject to conduct the investigation in the most general manner, and by an\nanalysis thoroughly exhaustive. With this end in view, the brevity or prolixity\nof the method employed is a matter of indifference. Indeed the analysis is\nnot properly that of the syllogism, but of a much more general combination of\npropositions; for we are permitted to assign to the symbols v, v\u2032, w, w\u2032, any\nclass-interpretations that we please. To illustrate this remark, I will apply the\nsolution (I.) to the following imaginary case:\nSuppose that a number of pieces of cloth striped with different colours were\nsubmitted to inspection, and that the two following observations were made\nupon them:\n1st. That every piece striped with white and green was also striped with\nblack and yellow, and vice vers\u02c6a.\n2nd. That every piece striped with red and orange was also striped with\nblue and yellow, and vice vers\u02c6a. Suppose it then required to determine how\nthe pieces marked with green stood affected with reference to the colours white,\nblack, red, orange, and blue.\nHere if we assume v = white, x = green, v\u2032 = black, y = yellow, w = red,\nz = orange, w\u2032 = blue, the expression of our premises will be\nvx = v\u2032y,\nwz = w\u2032y,\nagreeing with the system (1) (2). The equation (I.) then leads to the following\nconclusion:\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 185\nPieces striped with green are either striped with orange, white, black, red,\nand blue, together, all pieces possessing which character are included in those\nstriped with green; or they are striped with orange, white, and black, but not\nwith red or blue; or they are striped with orange, red, and blue, but not with\nwhite or black; or they are striped with orange, but not with white or red; or\nthey are striped with white and black, but not with blue or orange; or they are\nstriped neither with white nor orange.\nConsidering the nature of this conclusion, neither the symbolical expression\n(I.) by which it is conveyed, nor the analysis by which that expression is deduced,\ncan be considered as needlessly complex.\n9. The form in which the doctrine of syllogism has been presented in this\nchapter affords ground for an important observation. We have seen that in\neach of its two great divisions the entire discussion is reducible, so far, at least,\nas concerns the determination of rules and methods, to the analysis of a pair\nof equations, viz., of the system (1), (2), when the premises have like middle\nterms, and of the system (4), (5), when the middle terms are unlike. Moreover,\nthat analysis has been actually conducted by a method founded upon certain\ngeneral laws deduced immediately from the constitution of language, Chap. ii.\nconfirmed by the study of the operations of the human mind, Chap. iii., and\nproved to be applicable to the analysis of all systems of equations whatever,\nby which propositions, or combinations of propositions, can be represented,\nChap. viii. Here, then, we have the means of definitely resolving the question,\nwhether syllogism is indeed the fundamental type of reasoning,\u2014whether the\nstudy of its laws is co-extensive with the study of deductive logic. For if it be so,\nsome indication of the fact must be given in the systems of equations upon the\nanalysis of which we have been engaged. It cannot be conceived that syllogism\nshould be the one essential process of reasoning, and yet the manifestation of\nthat process present nothing indicative of this high quality of pre-eminence. No\nsign, however, appears that the discussion of all systems of equations expressing\npropositions is involved in that of the particular system examined in this chapter.\nAnd yet writers on Logic have been all but unanimous in their assertion, not\nmerely of the supremacy, but of the universal sufficiency of syllogistic inference\nin deductive reasoning. The language of Archbishop Whately, always clear\nand definite, and on the subject of Logic entitled to peculiar attention, is very\nexpress on this point. \u201cFor Logic,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is, as it were, the Grammar\nof Reasoning, does not bring forward the regular Syllogism as a distinct mode of\nargumentation, designed to be substituted for any other mode; but as the form\nto which all correct reasoning may be ultimately reduced.\u201d2 And Mr. Mill, in a\nchapter of his System of Logic, entitled, \u201cOf Ratiocination or Syllogism,\u201d having\nenumerated the ordinary forms of syllogism, observes, \u201cAll valid ratiocination,\nall reasoning by which from general propositions previously admitted, other\npropositions, equally or less general, are inferred, may be exhibited in some of\nthe above forms.\u201d And again: \u201cWe are therefore at liberty, in conformity with\nthe general opinion of logicians, to consider the two elementary forms of the first\n2Elements of Logic, p. 13, ninth edition.\nCHAPTER XV. ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 186\nfigure as the universal types of all correct ratiocination.\u201d In accordance with\nthese views it has been contended that the science of Logic enjoys an immunity\nfrom those conditions of imperfection and of progress to which all other sciences\nare subject;3 and its origin from the travail of one mighty mind of old has, by a\nsomewhat daring metaphor, been compared to the mythological birth of Pallas.\nAs Syllogism is a species of elimination, the question before us manifestly\nresolves itself into the two following ones:\u20141st. Whether all elimination\nis reducible to Syllogism; 2ndly. Whether deductive reasoning can with\npropriety be regarded as consisting only of elimination. I believe, upon careful\nexamination, the true answer to the former question to be, that it is always\ntheoretically possible so to resolve and combine propositions that elimination\nmay subsequently be effected by the syllogistic canons, but that the process of\nreduction would in many instances be constrained and unnatural, and would\ninvolve operations which are not syllogistic. To the second question I reply,\nthat reasoning cannot, except by an arbitrary restriction of its meaning, be\nconfined to the process of elimination. No definition can suffice which makes\nit less than the aggregate of the methods which are founded upon the laws of\nthought, as exercised upon propositions; and among those methods, the process\nof elimination, eminently important as it is, occupies only a place.\nMuch of the error, as I cannot but regard it, which prevails respecting the\nnature of the Syllogism and the extent of its office, seems to be founded in\na disposition to regard all those truths in Logic as primary which possess the\ncharacter of simplicity and intuitive certainty, without inquiring into the relation\nwhich they sustain to other truths in the Science, or to general methods in\nthe Art, of Reasoning. Aristotle\u2019s dictum de omni et nullo is a self-evident\nprinciple, but it is not found among those ultimate laws of the reasoning faculty\nto which all other laws, however plain and self-evident, admit of being traced,\nand from which they may in strictest order of scientific evolution be deduced.\nFor though of every science the fundamental truths are usually the most simple\nof apprehension, yet is not that simplicity the criterion by which their title to\nbe regarded as fundamental must be judged. This must be sought for in the\nnature and extent of the structure which they are capable of supporting. Taking\nthis view, Leibnitz appears to me to have judged correctly when he assigned to\nthe \u201cprinciple of contradiction\u201d a fundamental place in Logic;4 for we have seen\nthe consequences of that law of thought of which it is the axiomatic expression\n(III. 15). But enough has been said upon the nature of deductive inference and\nupon its constitutive elements. The subject of induction may probably receive\nsome attention in another part of this work.\n10. It has been remarked in this chapter that the ordinary treatment of\nhypothetical, is much more defective than that of categorical, propositions.\nWhat is commonly termed the hypothetical syllogism appears, indeed, to be\nno syllogism at all.\nLet the argument\u2014\n3Introduction to Kant\u2019s \u201cLogik.\u201d\n4Nouveaux Essais sur l\u2019entendement humain.

ARISTOTELIAN LOGIC 187\nIf A is B, C is D,\nBut A is B,\nTherefore C is D,\nbe put in the form\u2014\nIf the proposition X is true, Y is true,\nBut X is true,\nTherefore Y is true;\nwherein by X is meant the proposition A is B, and by Y , the proposition C\nis D. It is then seen that the premises contain only two terms or elements,\nwhile a syllogism essentially involves three. The following would be a genuine\nhypothetical syllogism:\nIf X is true, Y is true;\nIf Y is true, Z is true;\n\u2234 If X is true, Z is true.\nAfter the discussion of secondary propositions in a former part of this work,\nit is evident that the forms of hypothetical syllogism must present, in every\nrespect, an exact counterpart to those of categorical syllogism. Particular\nPropositions, such as, \u201cSometimes if X is true, Y is true,\u201d may be introduced,\nand the conditions and rules of inference deduced in this chapter for categorical\nsyllogisms may, without abatement, be interpreted to meet the corresponding\ncases in hypotheticals.\n11. To what final conclusions are we then led respecting the nature and\nextent of the scholastic logic? I think to the following: that it is not a\nscience, but a collection of scientific truths, too incomplete to form a system of\nthemselves, and not sufficiently fundamental to serve as the foundation upon\nwhich a perfect system may rest. It does not, however, follow, that because\nthe logic of the schools has been invested with attributes to which it has no\njust claim, it is therefore undeserving of regard. A system which has been\nassociated with the very growth of language, which has left its stamp upon the\ngreatest questions and the most famous demonstrations of philosophy, cannot\nbe altogether unworthy of attention. Memory, too, and usage, it must be\nadmitted, have much to do with the intellectual processes; and there are certain\nof the canons of the ancient logic which have become almost inwoven in the\nvery texture of thought in cultured minds. But whether the mnemonic forms,\nin which the particular rules of conversion and syllogism have been exhibited,\npossess any real utility,\u2014whether the very skill which they are supposed to\nimpart might not, with greater advantage to the mental powers, be acquired by\nthe unassisted efforts of a mind left to its own resources,\u2014are questions which\nit might still be not unprofitable to examine. As concerns the particular results\ndeduced in this chapter, it is to be observed, that they are solely designed to\naid the inquiry concerning the nature of the ordinary or scholastic logic, and its\nrelation to a more perfect theory of deductive reasoning.\nChapter XVI\nON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES\n1. Before the expiration of another year just two centuries will have rolled\naway since Pascal solved the first known question in the theory of Probabilities,\nand laid, in its solution, the foundations of a science possessing no common\nshare of the attraction which belongs to the more abstract of mathematical\nspeculations. The problem which the Chevalier de M\u00b4er\u00b4e, a reputed gamester,\nproposed to the recluse of Port Royal (not yet withdrawn from the interests of\nscience1by the more distracting contemplation of the \u201cgreatness and the misery\nof man\u201d), was the first of a long series of problems, destined to call into existence\nnew methods in mathematical analysis, and to render valuable service in the\npractical concerns of life. Nor does the interest of the subject centre merely\nin its mathematical connexion, or its associations of utility. The attention is\nrepaid which is devoted to the theory of Probabilities as an independent object\nof speculation,\u2014to the fundamental modes in which it has been conceived,\u2014\nto the great secondary principles which, as in the contemporaneous science of\nMechanics, have gradually been annexed to it,\u2014and, lastly, to the estimate of\nthe measure of perfection which has been actually attained. I speak here of that\nperfection which consists in unity of conception and harmony of processes. Some\nof these points it is designed very briefly to consider in the present chapter.\n2. A distinguished writer2 has thus stated the fundamental definitions of the\nscience:\n\u201cThe probability of an event is the reason we have to believe that it has\ntaken place, or that it will take place.\u201d\n\u201cThe measure of the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases\nfavourable to that event, to the total number of cases favourable or contrary,\nand all equally possible\u201d (equally likely to happen).\nFrom these definitions it follows that the word probability, in its mathematical\nacceptation, has reference to the state of our knowledge of the circumstances\nunder which an event may happen or fail. With the degree of information\n1See in particular a letter addressed by Pascal to Fermat, who had solicited his attention\nto a mathematical problem (Port Royal, par M. de Sainte Beuve); also various passages in\nthe collection of Fragments published by M. Prosper Faug`ere.\n2Poisson, Recherches sur la Probabilit`e des Jugemens.\n188\nCHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 189\nwhich we possess concerning the circumstances of an event, the reason we have\nto think that it will occur, or, to use a single term, our expectation of it, will\nvary. Probability is expectation founded upon partial knowledge. A perfect\nacquaintance with all the circumstances affecting the occurrence of an event\nwould change expectation into certainty, and leave neither room nor demand\nfor a theory of probabilities.\n3. Though our expectation of an event grows stronger with the increase of\nthe ratio of the number of the known cases favourable to its occurrence to the\nwhole number of equally possible cases, favourable or unfavourable, it would be\nunphilosophical to affirm that the strength of that expectation, viewed as an\nemotion of the mind, is capable of being referred to any numerical standard. The\nman of sanguine temperament builds high hopes where the timid despair, and\nthe irresolute are lost in doubt. As subjects of scientific inquiry, there is some\nanalogy between opinion and sensation. The thermometer and the carefully\nprepared photographic plate indicate, not the intensity of the sensations of heat\nand light, but certain physical circumstances which accompany the production of\nthose sensations. So also the theory of probabilities contemplates the numerical\nmeasure of the circumstances upon which expectation is founded; and this\nobject embraces the whole range of its legitimate applications. The rules which\nwe employ in life-assurance, and in the other statistical applications of the\ntheory of probabilities, are altogether independent of the mental ph\u00e6nomena of\nexpectation. They are founded upon the assumption that the future will bear\na resemblance to the past; that under the same circumstances the same event\nwill tend to recur with a definite numerical frequency; not upon any attempt to\nsubmit to calculation the strength of human hopes and fears.\nNow experience actually testifies that events of a given species do, under\ngiven circumstances, tend to recur with definite frequency, whether their true\ncauses be known to us or unknown. Of course this tendency is, in general, only\nmanifested when the area of observation is sufficiently large. The judicial records\nof a great nation, its registries of births and deaths, in relation to age and sex,\n&c., present a remarkable uniformity from year to year. In a given language,\nor family of languages, the same sounds, and successions of sounds, and, if it\nbe a written language, the same characters and successions of characters recur\nwith determinate frequency. The key to the rude Ogham inscriptions, found\nin various parts of Ireland, and in which no distinction of words could at first\nbe traced, was, by a strict application of this principle, recovered.3The same\nmethod, it is understood, has been applied 4 to the deciphering of the cuneiform\nrecords recently disentombed from the ruins of Nineveh by the enterprise of Mr.\nLayard.\n4. Let us endeavour from the above statements and definitions to form a\nconception of the legitimate object of the theory of Probabilities.\n3The discovery is due to the Rev. Charles Graves, Professor of Mathematics in the\nUniversity of Dublin.\u2013 Vide Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Feb. 14, 1848. Professor\nGraves informs me that he has verified the principle by constructing sequence tables for all\nthe European languages.\n4By the learned Orientalist, Dr. Edward Hincks.\nCHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 190\nProbability, it has been said, consists in the expectation founded upon a\nparticular kind of knowledge, viz., the knowledge of the relative frequency of\noccurrence of events. Hence the probabilities of events, or of combinations\nof events, whether deduced from a knowledge of the particular constitution of\nthings under which they happen, or derived from the long-continued observation\nof a past series of their occurrences and failures, constitute, in all cases, our data.\nThe probability of some connected event, or combination of events, constitutes\nthe corresponding qu\u00e6situm, or object sought. Now in the most general, yet\nstrict meaning of the term \u201cevent,\u201d every combination of events constitutes also\nan event. The simultaneous occurrence of two or more events, or the occurrence\nof an event under given conditions, or in any conceivable connexion with other\nevents, is still an event. Using the term in this liberty of application, the object\nof the theory of probabilities might be thus defined. Given the probabilities\nof any events, of whatever kind, to find the probability of some other event\nconnected with them.\n5. Events may be distinguished as simple or compound, the latter term\nbeing applied to such events as consist in a combination of simple events (I. 13).\nIn this manner we might define it as the practical end of the theory under\nconsideration to determine the probability of some event, simple or compound,\nfrom the given probabilities of other events, simple or compound, with which,\nby the terms of its definition, it stands connected.\nThus if it is known from the constitution of a die that there is a probability,\nmeasured by the fraction 1\n6 , that the result of any particular throw will be an\nace, and if it is required to determine the probability that there shall occur one\nace, and only one, in two successive throws, we may state the problem in the\norder of its data and its qu\u00e6situm, as follows:\nFirst Datum.\u2014Probability of the event that the first throw will give an\nace = 1\n6 .\nSecond Datum.\u2014Probability of the event that the second throw will give\nan ace = 1\n6 .\nQu\u00e6situm.\u2014Probability of the event that either the first throw will give an\nace, and the second not an ace; or the first will not give an ace, and the second\nwill give one.\nHere the two data are the probabilities of simple events defined as the first\nthrow giving an ace, and the second throw giving an ace. The qu\u00e6situm is\nthe probability of a compound event,\u2014a certain disjunctive combination of the\nsimple events involved or implied in the data. Probably it will generally happen,\nwhen the numerical conditions of a problem are capable of being deduced, as\nabove, from the constitution of things under which they exist, that the data\nwill be the probabilities of simple events, and the qu\u00e6situm the probability of\na compound event dependent upon the said simple events. Such is the case\nwith a class of problems which has occupied perhaps an undue share of the\nattention of those who have studied the theory of probabilities, viz., games of\nchance and skill, in the former of which some physical circumstance, as the\nCHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 191\nconstitution of a die, determines the probability of each possible step of the\ngame, its issue being some definite combination of those steps; while in the\nlatter, the relative dexterity of the players, supposed to be known `a priori,\nequally determines the same element. But where, as in statistical problems, the\nelements of our knowledge are drawn, not from the study of the constitution\nof things, but from the registered observations of Nature or of human society,\nthere is no reason why the data which such observations afford should be the\nprobabilities of simple events. On the contrary, the occurrence of events or\nconditions in marked combinations (indicative of some secret connexion of a\ncausal character) suggests to us the propriety of making such concurrences,\nprofitable for future instruction by a numerical record of their frequency. Now\nthe data which observations of this kind afford are the probabilities of compound\nevents. The solution, by some general method, of problems in which such data\nare involved, is thus not only essential to the perfect development of the theory\nof probabilities, but also a perhaps necessary condition of its application to a\nlarge and practically important class of inquiries.\n6. Before we proceed to estimate to what extent known methods may be\napplied to the solution of problems such as the above, it will be advantageous\nto notice, that there is another form under which all questions in the theory of\nprobabilities may be viewed; and this form consists in substituting for events\nthe propositions which assert that those events have occurred, or will occur;\nand viewing the element of numerical probability as having reference to the\ntruth of those propositions, not to the occurrence of the events concerning which\nthey make assertion. Thus, instead of considering the numerical fraction p as\nexpressing the probability of the occurrence of an event E, let it be viewed as\nrepresenting the probability of the truth of the proposition X, which asserts\nthat the event E will occur. Similarly, instead of any probability, q, being\nconsidered as referring to some compound event, such as the concurrence\nof the events E and F , let it represent the probability of the truth of\nthe proposition which asserts that E and F will jointly occur; and in like\nmanner, let the transformation be made from disjunctive and hypothetical\ncombinations of events to disjunctive and conditional propositions. Though the\nnew application thus assigned to probability is a necessary concomitant of the\nold one, its adoption will be attended with a practical advantage drawn from\nthe circumstance that we have already discussed the theory of propositions,\nhave defined their principal varieties, and established methods for determining,\nin every case, the amount and character of their mutual dependence. Upon\nthis, or upon some equivalent basis, any general theory of probabilities must\nrest. I do not say that other considerations may not in certain cases of applied\ntheory be requisite. The data may prove insufficient for definite solution, and\nthis defect it may be thought necessary to supply by hypothesis. Or, where the\nstatement of large numbers is involved, difficulties may arise after the solution,\nfrom this source, for which special methods of treatment are required. But\nin every instance, some form of the general problem as above stated (Art. 4)\nis involved, and in the discussion of that problem the proper and peculiar\nwork of the theory consists. I desire it to be observed, that to this object the\nCHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 192\ninvestigations of the following chapters are mainly devoted. It is not intended to\nenter, except incidentally, upon questions involving supplementary hypotheses,\nbecause it is of primary importance, even with reference to such questions\n(I. 17), that a general method, founded upon a solid and sufficient basis of\ntheory, be first established.\n7. The following is a summary, chiefly taken from Laplace, of the principles\nwhich have been applied to the solution of questions of probability. They are\nconsequences of its fundamental definitions already stated, and may be regarded\nas indicating the degree in which it has been found possible to render those\ndefinitions available.\nPrinciple 1st. If p be the probability of the occurrence of any event, 1 \u2212 p\nwill be the probability of its non-occurrence.\n2nd. The probability of the concurrence of two independent events is the\nproduct of the probabilities of those events.\n3rd. The probability of the concurrence of two dependent events is equal\nto the product of the probability of one of them by the probability that if that\nevent occur, the other will happen also.\n4th. The probability that if an event, E, take place, an event, F , will also\ntake place, is equal to the probability of the concurrence of the events E and\nF , divided by the probability of the occurrence of E.\n5th. The probability of the occurrence of one or the other of two events\nwhich cannot concur is equal to the sum of their separate probabilities.\n6th. If an observed event can only result from some one of n different causes\nwhich are `a priori equally probable, the probability of any one of the causes is\na fraction whose numerator is the probability of the event, on the hypothesis of\nthe existence of that cause, and whose denominator is the sum of the similar\nprobabilities relative to all the causes.\n7th. The probability of a future event is the sum of the products formed by\nmultiplying the probability of each cause by the probability that if that cause\nexist, the said future event will take place.\n8. Respecting the extent and the relative sufficiency of these principles, the\nfollowing observations may be made.\n1st. It is always possible, by the due combination of these principles, to\nexpress the probability of a compound event, dependent in any manner upon\nindependent simple events whose distinct probabilities are given. A very large\nproportion of the problems which have been actually solved are of this kind,\nand the difficulty attending their solution has not arisen from the insufficiency\nof the indications furnished by the theory of probabilities, but from the need of\nan analysis which should render those indications available when functions of\nlarge numbers, or series consisting of many and complicated terms, are thereby\nintroduced. It may, therefore, be fully conceded, that all problems having for\ntheir data the probabilities of independent simple events fall within the scope\nof received methods.\n2ndly. Certain of the principles above enumerated, and especially the sixth\nand seventh, do not presuppose that all the data are the probabilities of simple\nevents. In their peculiar application to questions of causation, they do, however,\nCHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 193\nassume, that the causes of which they take account are mutually exclusive, so\nthat no combination of them in the production of an effect is possible. If,\nas before explained, we transfer the numerical probabilities from the events\nwith which they are connected to the propositions by which those events are\nexpressed, the most general problem to which the aforesaid principles are\napplicable may be stated in the following order of data and qu\u00e6sita.\ndata.\n1st. The probabilities of the n conditional propositions:\nIf the cause A1 exist, the event E will follow;\n\u201d A2 \u201d E \u201d\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\u201d An \u201d E \u201d\n2nd. The condition that the antecedents of those propositions are mutually\nconflicting.\nrequirements.\nThe probability of the truth of the proposition which declares the occurrence\nof the event E; also, when that proposition is known to be true, the probabilities\nof truth of the several propositions which affirm the respective occurrences of\nthe causes A1, A2 . . . An.\nHere it is seen, that the data are the probabilities of a series of compound\nevents, expressed by conditional propositions. But the system is obviously a very\nlimited and particular one. For the antecedents of the propositions are subject\nto the condition of being mutually exclusive, and there is but one consequent,\nthe event E, in the whole system. It does not follow, from our ability to discuss\nsuch a system as the above, that we are able to resolve problems whose data are\nthe probabilities of any system of conditional propositions; far less that we can\nresolve problems whose data are the probabilities of any system of propositions\nwhatever. And, viewing the subject in its material rather than its formal aspect,\nit is evident, that the hypothesis of exclusive causation is one which is not often\nrealized in the actual world, the ph\u00e6nomena of which seem to be, usually, the\nproducts of complex causes, the amount and character of whose co-operation is\nunknown. Such is, without doubt, the case in nearly all departments of natural\nor social inquiry in which the doctrine of probabilities holds out any new promise\nof useful applications.\n9. To the above principles we may add another, which has been stated in\nthe following terms by the Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of\nOxford.5\n\u201cPrinciple 8. If there be any number of mutually exclusive hypotheses,\nh1, h2, h3, . . . of which the probabilities relative to a particular state of\ninformation are p1, p2, p3, . . . and if new information be given which changes\n5On certain Questions relating to the Theory of Probabilities; by W. F. Donkin, M. A., F.\nR. S., &c. Philosophical Magazine, May, 1851.\nCHAPTER XVI. ON THE THEORY OF PROBABILITIES. 194\nthe probabilities of some of them, suppose of hm+1 and all that follow, without\nhaving otherwise any reference to the rest; then the probabilities of these latter\nhave the same ratios to one another, after the new information, that they had\nbefore, that is,\np\u2032\n1 : p\u2032\n2 : p\u2032\n3 . . . : p\u2032\nm = p1 : p2 : p3 . . . : pm,\nwhere the accented letters denote the values after the new information has been\nacquired.\u201d\nThis principle is apparently of a more fundamental character than the most\nof those before enumerated, and perhaps it might, as has been suggested by\nProfessor Donkin, be regarded as axiomatic. It seems indeed to be founded in\nthe very definition of the measure of probability, as \u201cthe ratio of the number\nof cases favourable to an event to the total number of cases favourable or\ncontrary, and all equally possible.\u201d For, adopting this definition, it is evident\nthat in whatever proportion the number of equally possible cases is diminished,\nwhile the number of favourable cases remains unaltered, in exactly the same\nproportion will the probabilities of any events to which these cases have reference\nbe increased. And as the new hypothesis, viz., the diminution of the number\nof possible cases without affecting the number of them which are favourable to\nthe events in question, increases the probabilities of those events in a constant\nratio, the relative measures of those probabilities remain unaltered. If the\nprinciple we are considering be then, as it appears to be, inseparably involved\nin the very definition of probability, it can scarcely, of itself, conduct us further\nthan the attentive study of the definition would alone do, in the solution of\nproblems. From these considerations it appears to be doubtful whether, without\nsome aid of a different kind from any that has yet offered itself to our notice,\nany considerable advance, either in the theory of probabilities as a branch of\nspeculative knowledge, or in the practical solution of its problems can be hoped\nfor. And the establishment, solely upon the basis of any such collection of\nprinciples as the above, of a method universally applicable to the solution\nof problems, without regard either to the number or to the nature of the\npropositions involved in the expression of their data, seems to be impossible. For\nthe attainment of such an object other elements are needed, the consideration\nof which will occupy the next chapter.\nChapter XVII\nDEMONSTRATION OF A GENERAL METHOD FOR\nTHE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN THE THEORY\nOF PROBABILITIES.\n1. It has been defined (XVI. 2), that \u201cthe measure of the probability of an event\nis the ratio of the number of cases favourable to that event, to the total number\nof cases favourable or unfavourable, and all equally possible.\u201d In the following\ninvestigations the term probability will be used in the above sense of \u201cmeasure\nof probability.\u201d\nFrom the above definition we may deduce the following conclusions.\nI. When it is certain that an event will occur, the probability of that event,\nin the above mathematical sense, is 1. For the cases which are favourable to the\nevent, and the cases which are possible, are in this instance the same.\nHence, also, if p be the probability that an event x will happen, 1 \u2212 p will\nbe the probability that the said event will not happen. To deduce this result\ndirectly from the definition, let m be the number of cases favourable to the\nevent x, n the number of cases possible, then n \u2212 m is the number of cases\nunfavourable to the event x. Hence, by definition,\nm\nn = probability that x will happen.\nn \u2212 m\nn = probability that x will not happen.\nBut n \u2212 m\nn = 1 \u2212 m\nn = 1 \u2212 p.\nII. The probability of the concurrence of any two events is the product of the\nprobability of either of those events by the probability that if that event occur,\nthe other will occur also.\nLet m be the number of cases favourable to the happening of the first\nevent, and n the number of equally possible cases unfavourable to it; then the\nprobability of the first event is, by definition, m\nm + n . Of the m cases favourable\n195\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 196\nto the first event, let l cases be favourable to the conjunction of the first and\nsecond events, then, by definition, l\nm is the probability that if the first event\nhappen, the second also will happen. Multiplying these fractions together, we\nhave m\nm + n \u00d7 l\nm = l\nm + n .\nBut the resulting fraction l\nm+n has for its numerator the number of cases\nfavourable to the conjunction of events, and for its denominator, the number\nm + n of possible cases. Therefore, it represents the probability of the joint\noccurrence of the two events.\nHence, if p be the probability of any event x, and q the probability that if x\noccur y will occur, the probability of the conjunction xy will be pq.\nIII. The probability that if an event x occur, the event y will occur, is\na fraction whose numerator is the probability of their joint occurrence, and\ndenominator the probability of the occurrence of the event x.\nThis is an immediate consequence of Principle 2nd.\nIV. The probability of the occurrence of some one of a series of exclusive\nevents is equal to the sum of their separate probabilities.\nFor let n be the number of possible cases; m1 the number of those cases\nfavourable to the first event; m2 the number of cases favourable to the second,\n&c. Then the separate probabilities of the events are m1\nn , m2\nn , &c. Again, as the\nevents are exclusive, none of the cases favourable to one of them is favourable to\nanother; and, therefore, the number of cases favourable to some one of the series\nwill be m1 + m2 . . . , and the probability of some one of the series happening\nwill be m1 + m2 . . .\nn . But this is the sum of the previous fractions, m1\nn , m2\nn ,\n&c. Whence the principle is manifest. 2. Definition.\u2014Two events are said\nto be independent when the probability of the happening of either of them is\nunaffected by our expectation of the occurrence or failure of the other.\nFrom this definition, combined with Principle II., we have the following\nconclusion:\nV. The probability of the concurrence of two independent events is equal to\nthe product of the separate probabilities of those events.\nFor if p be the probability of an event x, q that of an event y regarded as\nquite independent of x, then is q also the probability that if x occur y will occur.\nHence, by Principle II., pq is the probability of the concurrence of x and y\nUnder the same circumstances, the probability that x will occur and y not\noccur will be p(1 \u2212 q). For p is the probability that x will occur, and 1 \u2212 q\nthe probability that y will not occur. In like manner (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q) will be the\nprobability that both the events fail of occurring.\n3. There exists yet another principle, different in kind from the above, but\nnecessary to the subsequent investigations of this chapter, before proceeding\nto the explicit statement of which I desire to make one or two preliminary\nobservations.\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 197\nI would, in the first place, remark that the distinction between simple\nand compound events is not one founded in the nature of events themselves,\nbut upon the mode or connexion in which they are presented to the mind.\nHow many separate particulars, for instance, are implied in the terms \u201cTo\nbe in health,\u201d \u201cTo prosper,\u201d &c., each of which might still be regarded as\nexpressing a \u201csimple event\u201d? The prescriptive usages of language, which have\nassigned to particular combinations of events single and definite appellations,\nand have left unnumbered other combinations to be expressed by corresponding\ncombinations of distinct terms or phrases, is essentially arbitrary. When, then,\nwe designate as simple events those which are expressed by a single verb,\nor by what grammarians term a simple sentence, we do not thereby imply\nany real simplicity in the events themselves, but use the term solely with\nreference to grammatical expression. 4. Now if this distinction of events, as\nsimple or compound, is not founded in their real nature, but rests upon the\naccidents of language, it cannot affect the question of their mutual dependence\nor independence. If my knowledge of two simple events is confined to this\nparticular fact, viz., that the probability of the occurrence of one of them is p,\nand that of the other q; then I regard the events as independent, and thereupon\naffirm that the probability of their joint occurrence is pq. But the ground of this\naffirmation is not that the events are simple ones, but that the data afford no\ninformation whatever concerning any connexion or dependence between them.\nWhen the probabilities of events are given, but all information respecting their\ndependence withheld, the mind regards them as independent. And this mode\nof thought is equally correct whether the events, judged according to actual\nexpression, are simple or compound, i.e., whether each of them is expressed by\na single verb or by a combination of verbs.\n5. Let it, however, be supposed that, together with the probabilities of\ncertain events, we possess some definite information respecting their possible\ncombinations. For example, let it be known that certain combinations are\nexcluded from happening, and therefore that the remaining combinations alone\nare possible. Then still is the same general principle applicable. The mode in\nwhich we avail ourselves of this information in the calculation of the probability\nof any conceivable issue of events depends not upon the nature of the events\nwhose probabilities and whose limits of possible connexion are given. It matters\nnot whether they are simple or compound. It is indifferent from what source, or\nby what methods, the knowledge of their probabilities and of their connecting\nrelations has been derived. We must regard the events as independent of\nany connexion beside that of which we have information, deeming it of no\nconsequence whether such information has been explicitly conveyed to us in the\ndata, or thence deduced by logical inference. And this leads us to the statement\nof the general principle in question, viz.:\nVI. The events whose probabilities are given are to be regarded as independent\nof any connexion but such as is either expressed, or necessarily implied, in the\ndata; and the mode in which our knowledge of that connexion is to be employed\nis independent of the nature of the source from which such knowledge has been\nderived.\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 198\nThe practical importance of the above principle consists in the circumstance,\nthat whatever may be the nature of the events whose probabilities are given,\u2014\nwhatever the nature of the event whose probability is sought, we are always\nable, by an application of the Calculus of Logic, to determine the expression of\nthe latter event as a definite combination of the former events, and definitely\nto assign the whole of the implied relations connecting the former events with\neach other. In other words, we can determine what that combination of the\ngiven events is whose probability is required, and what combinations of them\nare alone possible. It follows then from the above principle, that we can reason\nupon those events as if they were simple events, whose conditions of possible\ncombination had been directly given by experience, and of which the probability\nof some definite combination is sought. The possibility of a general method in\nprobabilities depends upon this reduction.\n6. As the investigations upon which we are about to enter are based upon\nthe employment of the Calculus of Logic, it is necessary to explain certain terms\nand modes of expression which are derived from this application.\nBy the event x, I mean that event of which the proposition which affirms\nthe occurrence is symbolically expressed by the equation\nx = 1.\nBy the event \u03d5(x, y, z, . . . ), I mean that event of which the occurrence is\nexpressed by the equation\n\u03d5(x, y, z, . . . ) = 1.\nSuch an event may be termed a compound event, in relation to the simple\nevents x, y, z, which its conception involves. Thus, if x represent the event \u201cIt\nrains,\u201d y the event \u201cIt thunders,\u201d the separate occurrences of those events being\nexpressed by the logical equations\nx = 1, y = 1,\nthen will x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) represent the event or state of things denoted by\nthe Proposition, \u201cIt either rains or thunders, but not both;\u201d the expression of\nthat state of things being\nx(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = 1.\nIf for brevity we represent the function phi(x, y, z, . . . ), used in the above\nacceptation by V , it is evident (VI. 13) that the law of duality\nV (1 \u2212 V ) = 0,\nwill be identically satisfied.\nThe simple events x, y, z will be said to be \u201cconditioned\u201d when they are\nnot free to occur in every possible combination; in other words, when some\ncompound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring. Thus the\nevents denoted by the propositions, \u201cIt rains,\u201d \u201cIt thunders,\u201d are \u201cconditioned\u201d\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 199\nif the event denoted by the proposition, \u201cIt thunders, but does not rain,\u201d is\nexcluded from happening, so that the range of possible is less than the range\nof conceivable combination. Simple unconditioned events are by definition\nindependent.\nAny compound event is similarly said to be conditioned if it is assumed that\nit can only occur under a certain condition, that is, in combination with some\nother event constituting, by its presence, that condition.\n7. We shall proceed in the natural order of thought, from simple and\nunconditioned, to compound and conditioned events.\nProposition I.\n1st. If p, q, r are the respective probabilities of any unconditioned simple\nevents x, y, z, the probability of any compound event V will be [V ], this function\n[V ] being formed by changing, in the function V , the symbols x, y, z into p, q,\nr, &c.\n2ndly. Under the same circumstances, the probability that if the event V\noccur, any other event V \u2032 will also occur, will be [V V \u2032]\nV , wherein [V V \u2032] denotes\nthe result obtained by multiplying together the logical functions V and V \u2032, and\nchanging in the result x, y, z, &c. into p, q, r, &c.\nLet us confine our attention in the first place to the possible combinations of\nthe two simple events, x and y, of which the respective probabilities are p and\nq. The primary combinations of those events (V.11), and their corresponding\nprobabilities, are as follows:\nevents. probabilities.\nxy, Concurrence of x and y, pq.\nx(1 \u2212 y), Occurrence of x without y, p(1 \u2212 q).\n(1 \u2212 x)y, Occurrence of y without x, (1 \u2212 p)q.\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y), Conjoint failure of x and y, (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q).\nWe see that in these cases the probability of the compound event represented\nby a constituent is the same function of p and q as the logical expression of that\nevent is of x and y; and it is obvious that this remark applies, whatever may\nbe the number of the simple events whose probabilities are given, and whose\njoint existence or failure is involved in the compound event of which we seek\nthe probability.\nConsider, in the second place, any disjunctive combination of the above\nconstituents. The compound event, expressed in ordinary language as the\noccurrence of \u201ceither the event x without the event y, or the event y without\nthe event x\u201d is symbolically expressed in the form x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x), and its\nprobability, determined by Principles iv. and v., is p(1\u2212q)+q(1\u2212p). The latter\nof these expressions is the same function of p and q as the former is of x and\ny. And it is obvious that this is also a particular illustration of a general rule.\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 200\nThe events which are expressed by any two or more constituents are mutually\nexclusive. The only possible combination of them is a disjunctive one, expressed\nin ordinary language by the conjunction or, in the language of symbolical logic\nby the sign +. Now the probability of the occurrence of some one out of a set\nof mutually exclusive events is the sum of their separate probabilities, and is\nexpressed by connecting the expressions for those separate probabilities by the\nsign +. Thus the law above exemplified is seen to be general. The probability\nof any unconditioned event V will be found by changing in V the symbols\nx, y, z, . . . into p, q, r, . . .\n8. Again, by Principle iii., the probability that if the event V occur, the\nevent V \u2032 will occur with it, is expressed by a fraction whose numerator is the\nprobability of the joint occurrence of V and V \u2032, and denominator the probability\nof the occurrence of V .\nNow the expression of that event, or state of things, which is constituted\nby the joint occurrence of the events V and V \u2032, will be formed by multiplying\ntogether the expressions V and V \u2032 according to the rules of the Calculus of\nLogic; since whatever constituents are found in both V and V \u2032 will appear\nin the product, and no others. Again, by what has just been shown, the\nprobability of the event represented by that product will be determined by\nchanging therein x, y, z into p, q, r, . . . Hence the numerator sought will be what\n[V V \u2032] by definition represents. And the denominator will be [V ], wherefore\nProbability that if V occur, V \u2032 will occur with it = [V V \u2032]\n[V ] .\n9. For example, if the probabilities of the simple events x, y, z are p, q, r\nrespectively, and it is required to find the probability that if either x or y occur,\nthen either y or z will occur, we have for the logical expressions of the antecedent\nand consequent\u2014\n1st. Either x or y occurs, x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x).\n2nd. Either y or z occurs, y(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 y).\nIf now we multiply these two expressions together according to the rules of\nthe Calculus of Logic, we shall have for the expression of the concurrence of\nantecedent and consequent,\nxz(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z).\nChanging in this result x, y, z into p, q, r, and similarly transforming the\nexpression of the antecedent, we find for the probability sought the value\npr(1 \u2212 q) + q(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 r)\np(1 \u2212 q) + q(1 \u2212 p) .\nThe special function of the calculus, in a case like the above, is to supply the\noffice of the reason in determining what are the conjunctures involved at once\nin the consequent and the antecedent. But the advantage of this application\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 201\nis almost entirely prospective, and will be made manifest in a subsequent\nproposition.\nProposition II.\n10. It is known that the probabilities of certain simple events x, y, z, . . .\nare p, q, r, . . . respectively when a certain condition V is satisfied; V being\nin expression a function of x, y, z, . . . . Required the absolute probabilities of\nthe events x, y, z, . . . , that is, the probabilities of their respective occurrence\nindependently of the condition V.\nLet, p\u2032, q\u2032, r\u2032, &c., be the probabilities required, i. e. the probabilities of the\nevents x, y, z,.., regarded not only as simple, but as independent events. Then\nby Prop. i. the probabilities that these events will occur when the condition V ,\nrepresented by the logical equation V = 1, is satisfied, are\n[xV ]\n[V ] , [yV ]\n[V ] , [zV ]\n[V ] , &c.,\nin which [xV ] denotes the result obtained by multiplying V by x, according to\nthe rules of the Calculus of Logic, and changing in the result x, y, z, into p\u2032,\nq\u2032, r\u2032, &c. But the above conditioned probabilities are by hypothesis equal to\np, q, r, . . . respectively. Hence we have,\n[xV ]\n[V ] = p, [yV ]\n[V ] = q, [zV ]\n[V ] = r, &c.,\nfrom which system of equations equal in number to the quantities p\u2032, q\u2032, r\u2032, . . . ,\nthe values of those quantities may be determined.\nNow xV consists simply of those constituents in V of which x is a factor.\nLet this sum be represented by Vx, and in like manner let yV be represented by\nV y, &c. Our equations then assume the form\n[Vx]\n[V ] = p, [Vy ]\n[V ] = q, &c.,\nwhere [Vx] denotes the results obtained by changing in Vx the symbols x, y, z,\n&c., into p\u2032, q\u2032, r\u2032, &c.\nTo render the meaning of the general problem and the principle of its solution\nmore evident, let us take the following example. Suppose that in the drawing of\nballs from an urn attention had only been paid to those cases in which the balls\ndrawn were either of a particular colour, \u201cwhite,\u201d or of a particular composition,\n\u201cmarble,\u201d or were marked by both these characters, no record having been kept\nof those cases in which a ball that was neither white nor of marble had been\ndrawn. Let it then have been found, that whenever the supposed condition was\nsatisfied, there was a probability p that a white ball would be drawn, arid a\nprobability q that a marble ball would be drawn: and from these data alone let\nit be required to find the probability that in the next drawing, without reference\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 202\nat all to the condition above mentioned, a white ball will be drawn; also the\nprobability that a marble ball will be drawn.\nHere if x represent the drawing of a white ball, y that of a marble ball, the\ncondition V will be represented by the logical function\nxy + x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y.\nHence we have\nVx = xy + x(1 \u2212 y) = x, Vy = xy + (1 \u2212 x)y = y;\nwhence\n[Vx] = p; [Vy ] = q;\nand the final equations of the problem are\np\u2032\np\u2032q\u2032 + p\u2032(1 \u2212 q\u2032) + q\u2032(1 \u2212 p\u2032) = p, q\u2032\np\u2032q\u2032 + p\u2032(1 \u2212 q\u2032) + q\u2032(1 \u2212 p\u2032) = q;\nfrom which we find\np\u2032 = p + q \u2212 1\nq , q\u2032 = p + q \u2212 1\np .\nIt is seen that p\u2032 and q\u2032 are respectively proportional to p and q, as by\nProfessor Donkin\u2019s principle they ought to be. The solution of this class of\nproblems might indeed, by a direct application of that principle, be obtained.\nTo meet a possible objection, I here remark, that the above reasoning\ndoes not require that the drawings of a white and a marble ball should be\nindependent, in virtue of the physical constitution of the balls. The assumption\nof their independence is indeed involved in the solution, but it does not rest\nupon any prior assumption as to the nature of the balls, and their relations,\nor freedom from relations, of form, colour, structure, &c. It is founded upon\nour total ignorance of all these things. Probability always has reference to\nthe state of our actual knowledge, and its numerical value varies with varying\ninformation.\nProposition III.\n11. To determine in any question of probabilities the logical connexion of\nthe qu\u00e6situm with the data; that is, to assign the event whose probability is\nsought, as a logical function of the event whose probabilities are given.\nLet S, T , &c., represent any compound events whose probabilities are\ngiven, S and T being in expression known functions of the symbols x, y, z,\n&c., representing simple events. Similarly let W represent any event whose\nprobability is sought, W being also a known function of x, y, z, &c. As\nS, T, . . . W must satisfy the fundamental law of duality, we are permitted to\nreplace them by single logical symbols, s, t, . . . w. Assume then\ns = S, t = T, w = W.\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 203\nThese, by the definition of S, T, . . . W , will be a series of logical equations\nconnecting the symbols s, t, . . . w, with the symbols x, y, z . . .\nBy the methods of the Calculus of Logic we can eliminate from the above\nsystem any of the symbols x, y, z, . . . , representing events whose probabilities\nare not given, and determine w as a developed function of s, t, &c., and of such\nof the symbols x, y, z, &c., if any such there be, as correspond to events whose\nprobabilities are given. The result will be of the form\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D,\nwhere A, B, C, and D comprise among them all the possible constituents which\ncan be formed from the symbols s, t, &c., i. e. from all the symbols representing\nevents whose probabilities are given.\nThe above will evidently be the complete expression of the relation sought.\nFor it fully determines the event W , represented by the single symbol w, as a\nfunction or combination of the events similarly denoted by the symbols s, t, &c.,\nand it assigns by the laws of the Calculus of Logic the condition\nD \u2212 0,\nas connecting the events s, t, &c., among themselves. We may, therefore, by\nPrinciple vi., regard s, t, &c., as simple events, of which the combination w,\nand the condition with which it is associated D, are definitely determined.\nUniformity in the logical processes of reduction being desirable, I shall here\nstate the order which will generally be pursued.\n12. By (viii. 8), the primitive equations are reducible to the forms\ns(1 \u2212 S) + S(1 \u2212 s) = 0;\nt(1 \u2212 T ) + T (1 \u2212 t) = 0; (1)\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nw(1 \u2212 W ) \u2212 W (1 \u2212 w) = 0;\nunder which they can be added together without impairing their significance.\nWe can then eliminate the symbols x, y, z, either separately or together. If the\nlatter course is chosen, it is necessary, after adding together the equations of the\nsystem, to develop the result with reference to all the symbols to be eliminated,\nand equate to 0 the product of all the coefficients of the constituents (vii. 9).\nAs w is the symbol whose expression is sought, we may also, by Prop. iii.\nChap. ix., express the result of elimination in the form\nEw + E\u2032(1 \u2212 w) = 0.\nE and E\u2032 being successively determined by making in the general system (1),\nw = 1 and w = 0, and eliminating the symbols x, y, z, . . . Thus the single\nequations from which E and E\u2032 are to be respectively determined become\ns(1 \u2212 S) + S(1 \u2212 s) + t(1 \u2212 T ) + T (1 \u2212 t) . . . + 1 \u2212 W = 0;\ns(1 \u2212 S) + S(1 \u2212 s) + t(1 \u2212 T ) + T (1 \u2212 t) + W = 0.\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 204\nFrom these it only remains to eliminate x, y, z, &c., and to determine w by\nsubsequent development. In the process of elimination we may, if needful, avail\nourselves of the simplifications of Props. i. and ii. Chap. ix.\n13. Should the data, beside informing us of the probabilities of events,\nfurther assign among them any explicit connexion, such connexion must be\nlogically expressed, and the equation or equations thus formed be introduced\ninto the general system.\nProposition IV.\n14. Given the probabilities of any system of events; to determine by a general\nmethod the consequent or derived probability of any other event.\nAs in the last Proposition, let S, T , &c., be the events whose probabilities\nare given, W the event whose probability is sought, these being known functions\nof x, y, z, &c. Let us represent the data as follows:\nProbability of S = p;\nProbability of T = q; (1)\nand so on, p, q, &c., being known numerical values. If then we represent the\ncompound event S by s, T by t, and W by w, we find by the last proposition,\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D; (2)\nA, B, C, and D being functions of s, t, &c. Moreover the data (1) are\ntransformed into\nProb. s = p, Prob. t = q, &c. (3)\nNow the equation (2) is resolvable into the system\nw = A + qC\nD = 0,\n)\n(4)\nq being an indefinite class symbol (VI. 12). But since by the properties of\nconstituents (V. Prop. iii.), we have\nA + B + C + D = 1,\nthe second equation of the above system may be expressed in the form\nA + B + C = 1.\nIf we represent the function A + B + C by V , the system (4) becomes\nw = A + qC; (5)\nV = 1. (6)\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 205\nLet us for a moment consider this result. Since V is the sum of a series\nof constituents of s, t, &c., it represents the compound event in which the\nsimple events involved are those denoted by s, t, &c. Hence (6) shows that\nthe events denoted by s, t, &c., and whose probabilities are p, q, &c., have\nsuch probabilities not as independent events, but as events subject to a certain\ncondition V . Equation (5) expresses w as a similarly conditioned combination\nof the same events.\nNow by Principle vi. the mode in which this knowledge of the connexion of\nevents has been obtained does not influence the mode in which, when obtained,\nit is to be employed. We must reason upon it as if experience had presented to\nus the events s, t, &c., as simple events, free to enter into every combination,\nbut possessing, when actually subject to the condition V , the probabilities p, q,\n&c., respectively.\nLet then p\u2032, q\u2032, . . . , be the corresponding probabilities of such events, when\nthe restriction V is removed. Then by Prop. ii. of the present chapter, these\nquantities will be determined by the system of equations,\n[Vs]\n[V ] = p, [Vt]\n[V ] = q, &c.; (7)\nand by Prop. i. the probability of the event w under the same condition V will\nbe\nProb. w = [A + cC]\n[V ] ; (8)\nwherein Vs denotes the sum of those constituents in V of which s is a factor,\nand [Vs] what that sum becomes when s, t, . . . , are changed into p\u2032, q\u2032, . . . ,\nrespectively. The constant c represents the probability of the indefinite event q;\nit is, therefore, arbitrary, and admits of any value from 0 to 1.\nNow it will be observed, that the values of,p\u2032, q\u2032, &c., are determined from\n(7) only in order that they may be substituted in (8), so as to render Prob. w\na function of known quantities, p, q, &c. It is obvious, therefore, that instead\nof the letters p\u2032, q\u2032, &c., we might employ any others as s, t, &c., in the same\nquantitative acceptations. This particular step would simply involve a change\nof meaning of the symbols s, t, &c.\u2014their ceasing to be logical, and becoming\nquantitative. The systems (7) and (8) would then become\nVs\nV = p, Vt\nV = q, &c.; (9)\nProb. w = A + cC\nV . (10)\nIn employing these, it is only necessary to determine from (9) s, t, &c., regarded\nas quantitative symbols, in terms of p, q, &c., and substitute the resulting values\nin (10). It is evident, that s, t, &c., inasmuch as they represent probabilities,\nwill be positive proper fractions.\nThe system (9) may be more symmetrically expressed in the form\nVs\np = Vt\nq . . . = V. (11)\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 206\nOr we may express both (9) and (10) together in the symmetrical system\nVs\np = Vt\nq . . . = A + cC\nu = V ; (12)\nwherein u represents Prob. w.\n15. It remains to interpret the constant c assumed to represent the\nprobability of the indefinite event q. Now the logical equation\nw = A + qC,\ninterpreted in the reverse order, implies that if either the event A take place,\nor the event C in connexion with the event q, the event w will take place, and\nnot otherwise. Hence q represents that condition under which, if the event C\ntake place, the event w will take place. But the probability of q is c. Hence,\ntherefore, c = probability that if the event C take place the event w will take\nplace.\nWherefore by Principle ii.,\nc = Probability of concurrence of C and w\nProbability of C .\nWe may hence determine the nature of that new experience from which the\nactual value of c may be obtained. For if we substitute in C for s, t, &c., their\noriginal expressions as functions of the simple events x, y, z, &c., we shall form\nthe expression of that event whose probability constitutes the denominator of\nthe above value of c; and if we multiply that expression by the original expression\nof w, we shall form the expression of that event whose probability constitutes\nthe numerator of c, and the ratio of the frequency of this event to that of the\nformer one, determined by new observations will give the value of c. Let it be\nremarked here, that the constant c does not necessarily make its appearance in\nthe solution of a problem. It is only when the data are insufficient to render\ndeterminate the probability sought, that this arbitrary element presents itself,\nand in this case it is seen that the final logical equation (2) or (5) informs us\nhow it is to be determined.\nIf that new experience by which c may be determined cannot be obtained,\nwe can still, by assigning to c its limiting values 0 and 1, determine the limits\nof the probability of w. These are\nMinor limit of Prob. w = A\nV .\nSuperior limit = A+C\nV .\nBetween these limits, it is certain that the probability sought must lie independently\nof all new experience which does not absolutely contradict the past.\nIf the expression of the event C consists of many constituents, the logical\nvalue of w being of the form\nw = A + 0\n0 C1 + 0\n0 C2 + &c.,\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 207\nwe can, instead of employing their aggregate as above, present the final solution\nin the form\nProb. w = A + c1C1 + c2C2 + &c.\nV .\nHere c1 = probability that if the event C1 occur, the event w will occur, and\nso on for the others. Convenience must decide which form is to be preferred.\n16. The above is the complete theoretical solution of the problem proposed.\nIt may be added, that it is applicable equally to the case in which any of the\nevents mentioned in its original statement are conditioned. Thus, if one of the\ndata is the probability p, that if the event x occur the event y will occur; the\nprobability of the occurrence of x not being given, we must assume Prob. x = c\n(an arbitrary constant), then Prob. xy = cp, and these two conditions must\nbe introduced into the data, and employed according to the previous method.\nAgain, if it is sought to determine the probability that if an event x occur an\nevent y will occur, the solution will assume the form\nProb. sought = Prob. xy\nProb. x ,\nthe numerator and denominator of which must be separately determined by the\nprevious general method.\n17. We are enabled by the results of these investigations to establish a\ngeneral rule for the solution of questions in probabilities.\nGeneral Rule.\nCase I.\u2014When all the events are unconditioned.\nForm the symbolical expressions of the events whose probabilities are given\nor sought.\nEquate such of those expressions as relate to compound events to a new\nseries of symbols, s, t, &c., which symbols regard as representing the events, no\nlonger as compound but simple, to whose expressions they have been equated.\nEliminate from the equations thus formed all the logical symbols, except\nthose which express events, s, t, &c., whose respective probabilities p, q, &c.\nare given, or the event w whose probability is sought, and determine w as a\ndeveloped function of s, t, &c. in the form\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D.\nLet A + B + C = V , and let Vs represent the aggregate of those constituents in\nV which contain s as a factor, Vt of those which contain t as a factor, and thus\nfor all the symbols whose probabilities are given.\nThen, passing from Logic to Algebra, form the equations\nVs\np = Vt\nq = V, (1)\nProb. w = A + cC\nV , (2)\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 208\nfrom (1) determine s, t, &c. as functions of p, q, &c., and substitute their values\nin (2). The result will express the solution required.\nOr form the symmetrical system of equations\nVs\np = Vt\nq . . . = A + cC\nu = V\n1 , (3)\nwhere u represents the probability sought.\nIf c appear in the solution, its interpretation will be\nc = Prob. Cw\nProb. c ,\nand this interpretation indicates the nature of the experience which is necessary\nfor its discovery.\nCase II.\u2014When some of the events are conditioned.\nIf there be given the probability p that if the event X occur, the event Y\nwill occur, and if the probability of the antecedent X be not given, resolve the\nproposition into the two following, viz.:\nProbability of X = c,\nProbability of XY = cp.\nIf the qu\u00e6situm be the probability that if the event W occur, the event Z will\noccur, determine separately, by the previous case, the terms of the fraction\nProb. W Z\nProb. W ,\nand the fraction itself will express the probability sought.\nIt is understood in this case that X, Y , W , Z may be any compound\nevents whatsoever. The expressions XY and W Z represent the products of\nthe symbolical expressions of X and Y and of W and Z, formed according to\nthe rules of the Calculus of Logic.\nThe determination of the single constant c may in certain cases be resolved\ninto, or replaced by, the determination of a series of arbitrary constants c1, c2 . . .\naccording to convenience, as previously explained.\n18. It has been stated (I. 12) that there exist two distinct definitions, or\nmodes of conception, upon which the theory of probabilities may be made to\ndepend, one of them being connected more immediately with Number, the\nother more directly with Logic. We have now considered the consequences\nwhich flow from the numerical definition, and have shown how it conducts us\nto a point in which the necessity of a connexion with Logic obviously suggests\nitself. We have seen to some extent what is the nature of that connexion;\nand further, in what manner the peculiar processes of Logic, and the more\nfamiliar ones of quantitative Algebra, are involved in the same general method\nof solution, each of these so accomplishing its own object that the two processes\nmay be regarded as supplementary to each other. It remains to institute the\nreverse order of investigation, and, setting out from a definition of probability\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 209\nin which the logical relation is more immediately involved, to show how the\nnumerical definition would thence arise, and how the same general method,\nequally dependent upon both elements, would finally, but by a different order\nof procedure, be established.\nThat between the symbolical expressions of the logical calculus and those of\nAlgebra there exists a close analogy, is a fact to which attention has frequently\nbeen directed in the course of the present treatise. It might even be said\nthat they possess a community of forms, and, to a very considerable degree,\na community of laws. With a single exception in the latter respect, their\ndifference is only one of interpretation. Thus the same expression admits of a\nlogical or of a quantitative interpretation, according to the particular meaning\nwhich we attach to the symbols it involves. The expression xy represents,\nunder the former condition, a concurrence of the events denoted by x and y;\nunder the latter, the product of the numbers or quantities denoted by x and\ny. And thus every expression denoting an event, simple or compound, admits,\nunder another system of interpretation, of a meaning purely quantitative. Here\nthen arises the question, whether there exists any principle of transition, in\naccordance with which the logical and the numerical interpretations of the same\nsymbolical expression shall have an intelligible connexion. And to this question\nthe following considerations afford an answer.\n19. Let it be granted that there exists such a feeling as expectation, a\nfeeling of which the object is the occurrence of events, and which admits\nof differing degrees of intensity. Let it also be granted that this feeling of\nexpectation accompanies our knowledge of the circumstances under which\nevents are produced, and that it varies with the degree and kind of that\nknowledge. Then, without assuming, or tacitly implying, that the intensity\nof the feeling of expectation, viewed as a mental emotion, admits of precise\nnumerical measurement, it is perfectly legitimate to inquire into the possibility\nof a mode of numerical estimation which shall, at least, satisfy these following\nconditions, viz., that the numerical value which it assigns shall increase when\nthe known circumstances of an event are felt to justify a stronger expectation,\nshall diminish when they demand a weaker expectation, and shall remain\nconstant when they obviously require an equal degree of expectation.\nNow these conditions at least will be satisfied, if we assume the fundamental\nprinciple of expectation to be this, viz., that the laws for the expression of\nexpectation, viewed as a numerical element, shall be the same as the laws for the\nexpression of the expected event viewed as a logical element. Thus if \u03d5(x, y, z)\nrepresent any unconditional event compounded in any manner of the events x,\ny, z, let the same expression \u03d5(x, y, z), according to the above principle, denote\nthe expectation of that event; x, y, z representing no longer the simple events\ninvolved, but the expectations of those events.\nFor, in the first place, it is evident that, under this hypothesis, the probability\nof the occurrence of some one of a set of mutually exclusive events will be equal\nto the sum of the separate probabilities of those events. Thus if the alternation\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 210\nin question consist of n mutually exclusive events whose expressions are\n\u03d51(x, y, z), \u03d52(x, y, z), . . . \u03d5n(x, y, z),\nthe expression of that alternation will be\n\u03d51(x, y, z) + \u03d52(x, y, z) . . . + \u03d5n(x, y, z) = 1;\nthe literal symbols x, y, z being logical, and relating to the simple events of which\nthe three alternatives are compounded: and, by hypothesis, the expression of\nthe probability that some one of those alternatives will occur is\n\u03d51(x, y, z) + \u03d52(x, y, z) . . . + \u03d5n(x, y, z),\nx, y, z here denoting the probabilities of the above simple events. Now this\nexpression increases, c\u00e6teris paribus, with the increase of the number of the\nalternatives which are involved, and diminishes with the diminution of their\nnumber; which is agreeable to the condition stated.\nFurthermore, if we set out from the above hypothetical definition of the\nmeasure of probability, we shall be conducted, either by necessary inference or\nby successive steps of suggestion, which might perhaps be termed necessary, to\nthe received numerical definition. We are at once led to recognise unity (1) as\nthe proper numerical measure of certainty. For it is certain that any event x or\nits contrary 1 \u2212 x will occur. The expression of this proposition is\nx + (1 \u2212 x) = 1,\nwhence, by hypothesis, x + (1 \u2212 x), the measure of the probability of the above\nproposition, becomes the measure of certainty. But the value of that expression\nis 1, whatever the particular value of x may be. Unity, or 1, is therefore, on the\nhypothesis in question, the measure of certainty.\nLet there, in the next place, be n mutually exclusive, but equally possible\nevents, which we will represent by t1, t2, . . . tn. The proposition which affirms\nthat some one of these must occur will be expressed by the equation\nt1 + t2 . . . + tn = 1;\nand, as when we pass in accordance with the reasoning of the last section to\nnumerical probabilities, the same equation remains true in form, and as the\nprobabilities t1, t2 . . . tn are equal, we have\nnt1 = 1,\nwhence tl = 1\nn , and similarly t2 = 1\nn , tn = 1\nn . Suppose it then required to\ndetermine the probability that some one event of the partial series t1, t2 . . . tm\nwill occur, we have for the expression required\nt1 + t2 . . . + tm = 1\nn + 1\nm . . . to m terms\n= m\nn .\nCHAPTER XVII. GENERAL METHOD IN PROBABILITIES 211\nHence, therefore, if there are m cases favourable to the occurrence of a particular\nalternation of events out of n possible and equally probable cases, the probability\nof the occurrence of that alternation will be expressed by the fraction m\nn .\nNow the occurrence of any event which may happen in different equally\npossible ways is really equivalent to the occurrence of an alternation, i.e., of some\none out of a set of alternatives. Hence the probability of the occurrence of any\nevent may be expressed by a fraction whose numerator represents the number of\ncases favourable to its occurrence, and denominator the total number of equally\npossible cases. But this is the rigorous numerical definition of the measure of\nprobability. That definition is therefore involved in the more peculiarly logical\ndefinition, the consequences of which we have endeavoured to trace.\n20. From the above investigations it clearly appears, 1st, that whether we\nset out from the ordinary numerical definition of the measure of probability,\nor from the definition which assigns to the numerical measure of probability\nsuch a law of value as shall establish a formal identity between the logical\nexpressions of events and the algebraic expressions of their values, we shall be\nled to the same system of practical results. 2ndly, that either of these definitions\npursued to its consequences, and considered in connexion with the relations\nwhich it inseparably involves, conducts us, by inference or suggestion, to the\nother definition. To a scientific view of the theory of probabilities it is essential\nthat both principles should be viewed together, in their mutual bearing and\ndependence.\nChapter XVIII\nELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE GENERAL\nMETHOD IN PROBABILITIES.\n1. It is designed here to illustrate, by elementary examples, the general method\ndemonstrated in the last chapter. The examples chosen will be chiefly such as,\nfrom their simplicity, permit a ready verification of the solutions obtained. But\nsome intimations will appear of a higher class of problems, hereafter to be more\nfully considered, the analysis of which would be incomplete without the aid of a\ndistinct method determining the necessary conditions among their data, in order\nthat they may represent a possible experience, and assigning the corresponding\nlimits of the final solutions. The fuller consideration of that method, and of its\napplications, is reserved for the next chapter.\n2. Ex. 1.\u2014The probability that it thunders upon a given day is p, the\nprobability that it both thunders and hails is q, but of the connexion of the\ntwo ph\u00e6nomena of thunder and hail, nothing further is supposed to be known.\nRequired the probability that it hails on the proposed day.\nLet x represent the event\u2014It thunders.\nLet y represent the event\u2014It hails.\nThen xy will represent the event\u2014It thunders and hails; and the data of the\nproblem are\nProb., x = p, Prob., xy = q.\nThere being here but one compound event xy involved, assume, according to\nthe rule,\nxy = u. (1)\nOur data then become\nProb., x = p, Prob., u = q; (2)\nand it is required to find Prob., y. Now (1) gives\ny = u\nx = ux + 1\n0 u(1 \u2212 x) + 0(1 \u2212 u)x + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 x).\n212\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 213\nHence (XVII. 17) we find\nV = ux + (1 \u2212 u)x + (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 x),\nVx = ux + (1 \u2212 u)x = x, Vu = ux;\nand the equations of the General Rule, viz.,\nVx\np = Vu\nq = V.\nProb., y = A + cC\nV\nbecome, on substitution, and observing that A = ux, C = (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 x), and\nthat V reduces to x + (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 x),\nx\np = ux\nq = x + (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 x), (3)\nProb., y = ux + c(1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 x)\nx + (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 x) , (4)\nfrom which we readily deduce, by elimination of x and u,\nProb., y = q + c(l \u2212 p). (5)\nIn this result c represents the unknown probability that if the event (1\u2212u)(1\u2212x)\nhappen, the event y will happen. Now (l \u2212 u)(l \u2212 x) = (l \u2212 xy)(1 \u2212 x) = 1 \u2212 x,\non actual multiplication. Hence c is the unknown probability that if it do not\nthunder, it will hail.\nThe general solution (5) may therefore be interpreted as follows:\u2014The\nprobability that it hails is equal to the probability that it thunders and hails, q,\ntogether with the probability that it does not thunder, 1 \u2212 p, multiplied by the\nprobability c, that if it does not thunder it will hail. And common reasoning\nverifies this result.\nIf c cannot be numerically determined, we find, on assigning to it the limiting\nvalues 0 and 1, the following limits of Prob., y, viz.:\nInferior limit = q.\nSuperior limit = q + 1 \u2212 p.\n3. Ex. 2.\u2014The probability that one or both of two events happen is p, that\none or both of them fail is q. What is the probability that only one of these\nhappens?\nLet x and y represent the respective events, then the data are\u2014\nProb. xy + x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y = p,\nProb. x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = q;\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 214\nand we are to find\nProb. x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x).\nHere all the events concerned being compound, assume\nxy + x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y = s,\nx(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = t,\nx(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y = w.\nThen eliminating x and y, and determining w as a developed function of s and\nt, we find\nw = st + 0s(1 \u2212 t) + 0(1 \u2212 s)t + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t).\nHence A = st, C = 0, V = st + s(1 \u2212 t) + (1 \u2212 s)t = s + (1 \u2212 s)t, Vs = s, Vt = t;\nand the equations of the General Rule (XVII. 17) become\ns\np = t\nq = s + (1 \u2212 s)t, (1)\nProb. w = st\ns + (1 \u2212 s)t ;\nwhence we find, on eliminating s and t,\nProb. w = p + q \u2212 1.\nHence p + q \u2212 1 is the measure of the probability sought. This result may be\nverified as follows:\u2014Since p is the probability that one or both of the given\nevents occur, 1 \u2212 p will be the probability that they both fail; and since q is\nthe probability that one or both fail, 1 \u2212 q is the probability that they both\nhappen. Hence 1 \u2212 p + 1 \u2212 q, or 2 \u2212 p \u2212 q, is the probability that they either\nboth happen or both fail. But the only remaining alternative which is possible\nis that one alone of the events happens. Hence the probability of this occurrence\nis 1 \u2212 (2 \u2212 p \u2212 q), or p + q \u2212 1, as above. 4. Ex. 3.\u2014The probability that a\nwitness A speaks the truth is p, the probability that another witness B speaks\nthe truth is q, and the probability that they disagree in a statement is r. What\nis the probability that if they agree, their statement is true?\nLet x represent the hypothesis that A speaks truth; y that B speaks truth;\nthen the hypothesis that A and B disagree in their statement will be represented\nby x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x); the hypothesis that they agree in statement by xy +\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y), and the hypothesis that they agree in the truth by xy. Hence\nwe have the following data:\nProb. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = r,\nfrom which we are to determine\nProb. xy\nProb. xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) .\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 215\nBut as Prob. x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = r, it is evident that Prob. xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)\nwill be 1 \u2212 r; we have therefore to seek\nProb. xy\n1 \u2212 r .\nNow the compound events concerned being in expression, x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x)\nand xy, let us assume\nx(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) = s\nxy = w\n\u001b\n(1)\nOur data then are Prob. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. s = r, and we are to find\nProb. w.\nThe system (1) gives, on reduction,\n{x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x)}(1 \u2212 s) + s{xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)}\n+ xy(1 \u2212 w) + w(1 \u2212 xy) = 0;\nwhence\nw = x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s) + y(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 s) + sxy + s(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) + xy\n2xy \u2212 1\n= 1\n0 xys + xy(1 \u2212 s) + 0x(1 \u2212 y)s + 1\n0 x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s)\n+0(1 \u2212 x)ys + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)s + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 s) (2)\n+0(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s).\nIn the expression of this development, the coefficient 1\n0 has been made to replace\nevery equivalent form (X. 6). Here we have\nV = xy(1 \u2212 s) + x(1 \u2212 y)s + (1 \u2212 x)ys + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s);\nwhence, passing from Logic to Algebra,\nxy(1 \u2212 s) + x(1 \u2212 y)s\np = xy(1 \u2212 s) + (1 \u2212 x)ys\nq\n= x(1 \u2212 y)s + (1 \u2212 x)ys\nr\n= xy(1 \u2212 s) + x(1 \u2212 y)s + (1 \u2212 x)ys + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s).\nProb. w = xy(1 \u2212 s)\nxy(1 \u2212 s) + x(1 \u2212 y)s + (1 \u2212 x)ys + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s) ,\nfrom which we readily deduce\nProb. w = p + q \u2212 r\n2 ;\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 216\nwhence we have Prob. xy\n1 \u2212 r = p + q \u2212 r\n2(1 \u2212 r) (3)\nfor the value sought.\nIf in the same way we seek the probability that if A and B agree in their\nstatement, that statement will be false, we must replace the second equation of\nthe system (1) by the following, viz.:\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = w;\nthe final logical equation will then be\nw = 1\n0 xys + 0xy(1 \u2212 s) + 0x(1 \u2212 y)s + 1\n0 x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s)\n+0(1 \u2212 x)ys + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 s) + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)s\n+(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 s); (4)\nwhence, proceeding as before, we finally deduce\nProb. w = 2 \u2212 p \u2212 q \u2212 r\n2 . (5)\nWherefore we have\nProb. (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)\n1 \u2212 r = 2 \u2212 p \u2212 g \u2212 r\n2(1 \u2212 r) (6)\nfor the value here sought.\nThese results are mutually consistent. For since it is certain that the joint\nstatement of A and B must be either true or false, the second members of (3)\nand (5) ought by addition to make 1. Now we have identically,\np + q \u2212 r\n2(1 \u2212 r) + 2 \u2212 p \u2212 q \u2212 r\n2(1 \u2212 r) = 1.\nIt is probable, from the simplicity of the results (5) and (6), that they might\neasily be deduced by the application of known principles; but it is to be remarked\nthat they do not fall directly within the scope of known methods. The number\nof the data exceeds that of the simple events which they involve. M. Cournot,\nin his very able work, \u201cExposition de la Theorie des Chances,\u201d has proposed,\nin such cases as the above, to select from the original premises different sets\nof data, each set equal in number to the simple events which they involve, to\nassume that those simple events are independent, determine separately from the\nrespective sets of the data their probabilities, and comparing the different values\nthus found for the same elements, judge how far the assumption of independence\nis justified. This method can only approach to correctness when the said simple\nevents prove, according to the above criterion, to be nearly or quite independent;\nand in the questions of testimony and of judgment, in which such an hypothesis\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 217\nis adopted, it seems doubtful whether it is justified by actual experience of the\nways of men.\n5. Ex. 4.\u2014From observations made during a period of general sickness, there\nwas a probability p that any house taken at random in a particular district was\nvisited by fever, a probability q that it was visited by cholera, and a probability\nr that it escaped both diseases, and was not in a defective sanitary condition\nas regarded cleanliness and ventilation. What is the probability that any house\ntaken at random was in a defective sanitary condition?\nWith reference to any house, let us appropriate the symbols x, y, z, as follows,\nviz.: The symbol x to the visitation of fever.\ny \u201d cholera.\nz defective sanitary condition.\nThe events whose probabilities are given are then denoted by x, y, and\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z), the event whose probability is sought is z. Assume then,\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = w;\nthen our data are,\nProb. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. w = r,\nand we are to find Prob. z. Now\nz = (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 w\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)\n= 1\n0 xyw + 0\n0 xy(1 \u2212 w) + 1\n0 x(1 \u2212 y) + 0\n0 x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 w)\n+ 1\n0 (1 \u2212 x)yw + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 w) + 0(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)w\n+ (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 w). (1)\nThe value of V deduced from the above is\nV = xy(1 \u2212 w) + x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 w) + (1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 w)\n+(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)w + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 w) = 1 \u2212 w + w(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y);\nand similarly reducing Vx, Vy , Vw, we get\nVx = x(1 \u2212 w), Vy = y(1 \u2212 w), Vw = w(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y);\nfurnishing the algebraic equations\nx(1 \u2212 w)\np = y(1 \u2212 w)\nq = w(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)\nr = 1 \u2212 w + w(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y). (2)\nAs respects those terms of the development characterized by the coefficients 0\n0 ,\nI shall, instead of collecting them into a single term, present them, for the sake\nof variety (xvii. 18), in the form\n0\n0 x(1 \u2212 w) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 w); (3)\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 218\nthe value of Prob. z will then be\nProb. z = (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 w) + cx(1 \u2212 w) + c\u2032(1 \u2212 x)y(1w)\n1 \u2212 w + w(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) . (4)\nFrom (2) and (4) we deduce\nProb. z = (1 \u2212 p \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 q \u2212 r)\n1 \u2212 r + cp + c\u2032 q(1 \u2212 p \u2212 r)\n1 \u2212 r ,\nas the expression of the probability required. If in this result we make c = 0,\nand c\u2032 = 0, we find for an inferior limit of its value (1\u2212p\u2212r)(1\u2212q\u2212r)\n1\u2212r ; and if we\nmake c = 1, c\u2032 = 1, we obtain for its superior limit 1 \u2212 r.\n6. It appears from inspection of this solution, that the premises chosen\nwere exceedingly defective. The constants c and c\u2032 indicate this, and the\ncorresponding terms (3) of the final logical equation show how the deficiency is\nto be supplied. Thus, since\nx(1 \u2212 w) = x{1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)} = x,\n(1 \u2212 x)y(1 \u2212 w) = (1 \u2212 x)y{1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)} = (1 \u2212 x)y,\nwe learn that c is the probability that if any house was visited by fever its\nsanitary condition is defective, and that c\u2032 is the probability that if any house\nwas visited by cholera without fever, its sanitary condition was defective.\nIf the terms of the logical development affected by the coefficient 0\n0 had been\ncollected together as in the direct statement of the general rule, the final solution\nwould have assumed the following form:\nProb. z = (1 \u2212 p \u2212 r)(1 \u2212 q \u2212 r)\n1 \u2212 r + c\n\u0012\np + q \u2212 pq\n1 \u2212 r\n\u0013\nc here representing the probability that if a house was visited by either or\nboth of the diseases mentioned, its sanitary condition was defective. This\nresult is perfectly consistent with the former one, and indeed the necessary\nequivalence of the different forms of solution presented in such cases may be\nformally established.\nThe above solution may be verified in particular cases. Thus, taking the\nsecond form, if c = 1 we find Prob. z = 1\u2212r, a correct result. For if the presence\nof either fever or cholera certainly indicated a defective sanitary condition, the\nprobability that any house would be in a defective sanitary state would be\nsimply equal to the probability that it was not found in that category denoted\nby z, the probability of which would, by the data, be 1 \u2212 r, Perhaps the general\nverification of the above solution would be difficult.\nThe constants p, q, and r in the above solution are subject to the conditions\np + r =\n< 1, q + r =\n< 1.\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 219\n7. Ex. 5.\u2014Given the probabilities of the premises of a hypothetical syllogism\nto find the probability of the conclusion.\nLet the syllogism in its naked form be as follows:\nMajor premiss: If the proposition Y is true X is true.\nMinor premiss: If the proposition Z is true Y is true.\nConclusion: If the proposition Z is true X is true.\nSuppose the probability of the major premiss to be p, that of the minor\npremiss q.\nThe data then are as follows, representing the proposition X by x, &c., and\nassuming c and c\u2032 as arbitrary constants:\nProb. y = c, Prob. xy = cp;\nProb. z = c\u2032, Prob. yz = c\u2032q;\nfrom which we are to determine,\nProb. xz\nProb. z or Prob. xz\nc\u2032 .\nLet us assume,\nxy = u, yz = v, xz = w,\nthen, proceeding according to the usual method to determine w as a developed\nfunction of y, z, w, and v, the symbols corresponding to propositions whose\nprobabilities are given, we find\nw = uzvy + 0u(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)y + 0(1 \u2212 u)zvy\n+ 0\n0 (1 \u2212 u)z(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 y) + 0(1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)y\n+ 0(1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 y) + terms whose coefficients are 1\n0 ;\nand passing from Logic to Algebra,\nuzvy + u(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)y\ncp = uzvy + (1 \u2212 u)zvy + (1 \u2212 u)z(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 y)\nc\u2032\n= uzvy + (1 \u2212 u)zvy\nc\u2032q\n= uzvy + u(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)y + (1 \u2212 u)zvy + (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)y\nc = V.\nProb. w = uzvy + a(1 \u2212 u)z(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 y)\nV ,\nwherein\nV = uzvy + u(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)y + (1 \u2212 u)zvy + (1 \u2212 u)z(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 y)\n+(1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)y + (1 \u2212 u)(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 v)(1 \u2212 y),\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 220\nthe solution of this system of equations gives\nProb. w = c\u2032pq + ac\u2032(1 \u2212 q),\nwhence Prob. xy\nc\u2032 = pq + a(1 \u2212 q),\nthe value required. In this expression the arbitrary constant a is the probability\nthat if the proposition Z is true and Y false, X is true. In other words, it is the\nprobability, that if the minor premiss is false, the conclusion is true.\nThis investigation might have been greatly simplified by assuming the\nproposition Z to be true, and then seeking the probability of X. The data\nwould have been simply\nProb. y = q, Prob. xy = pq;\nwhence we should have found Prob. x = pq + a(1 \u2212 q). It is evident that under\nthe circumstances this mode of procedure would have been allowable, but I have\npreferred to deduce the solution by the direct and unconditioned application of\nthe method. The result is one which ordinary reasoning verifies, and which it\ndoes not indeed require a calculus to obtain. General methods are apt to appear\nmost cumbrous when applied to cases in which their aid is the least required.\nLet it be observed, that the above method is equally applicable to the\ncategorical syllogism, and not to the syllogism only, but to every form of\ndeductive ratiocination. Given the probabilities separately attaching to the\npremises of any train of argument; it is always possible by the above method to\ndetermine the consequent probability of the truth of a conclusion legitimately\ndrawn from such premises. It is not needful to remind the reader, that the\ntruth and the correctness of a conclusion are different things.\n8. One remarkable circumstance which presents itself in such applications\ndeserves to be specially noticed. It is, that propositions which, when true, are\nequivalent, are not necessarily equivalent when regarded only as probable. This\nprinciple will be illustrated in the following example.\nEx. 6.\u2014Given the probability p of the disjunctive proposition \u201cEither the\nproposition Y is true, or both the propositions X and Y are false,\u201d required the\nprobability of the conditional proposition, \u201cIf the proposition X is true, Y is\ntrue.\u201d\nLet x and y be appropriated to the propositions X and Y respectively. Then\nwe have\nProb. y + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = p,\nfrom which it is required to find the value of Prob. xy\nProb. x .\nAssumey + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = t. (1)\nEliminating y we get\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 t) = 0.\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 221\nwhence\nx = 0\n0 t + 1 \u2212 t;\nand proceeding in the usual way,\nProb. x = 1 \u2212 p + cp. (2)\nWhere c is the probability that if either Y is true, or X and Y false, X is true.\nNext to find Prob. xy. Assume\nxy = w. (3)\nEliminating y from (1) and (3) we get\nz(1 \u2212 t) = 0;\nwhence, proceeding as above,\nProb. z = cp,\nc having the same interpretation as before. Hence\nProb. xy\nProb. x = cp\n1 \u2212 p + cp ,\nfor the probability of the truth of the conditional proposition given.\nNow in the science of pure Logic, which, as such, is conversant only with\ntruth and with falsehood, the above disjunctive and conditional propositions are\nequivalent. They are true and they are false together. It is seen, however, from\nthe above investigation, that when the disjunctive proposition has a probability\np, the conditional proposition has a different and partly indefinite probability\ncp\n1\u2212p+cp . Nevertheless these expressions are such, that when either of them\nbecomes 1 or 0, the other assumes the same value. The results are, therefore,\nperfectly consistent, and the logical transformation serves to verify the formula\ndeduced from the theory of probabilities.\nThe reader will easily prove by a similar analysis, that if the probability of\nthe conditional proposition were given as p, that of the disjunctive proposition\nwould be 1 \u2212 c + cp, where c is the arbitrary probability of the truth of the\nproposition X.\n9. Ex. 7.\u2014Required to determine the probability of an event x, having\ngiven either the first, or the first and second, or the first, second, and third of\nthe following data, viz.:\n1st.

The probability that the event y occurs, or that it alone of the three\nevents x, y, z, fails, is q.\n3rd. The probability that the event z occurs, or that it alone of the three\nevents x, y, z, fails, is r.\nCHAPTER XVIII. ELEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS 222\nsolution of the first case.\nHere we suppose that only the first of the above data is given. We have\nthen,\nProb. {x + 1 \u2212 x\u0001yz} = p,\nto find Prob. x,\nLetx + 1 \u2212 x\u0001yz = s,\nthen eliminating yz as a single symbol, we get,\nx1 \u2212 s\u0001 = 0.\nHence\nx = 0\n1 \u2212 s = 0\n0 s + 01 \u2212 s\u0001,\nwhence, proceeding according to the rule, we have\nProb. x = cp, (1)\nwhere c is the probability that if x occurs, or alone fails, the former of the two\nalternatives is the one that will happen.

It is, however, all that the single datum here\nassumed really warrants us in inferring. We shall in the next solution see how\nan addition to our data restricts within narrower limits the final solution.\nsolution of the second case.\nHere we assume as our data the equations\nProb. {x + 1 \u2212 x\u0001yz} = p,\nProb. {y + 1 \u2212 y\u0001xz} = q.\nLet us write\nx + 1 \u2212 x\u0001yz = s,\ny + 1 \u2212 y\u0001xz = q,\nfrom the first of which we have, by (VIII. 7),\n{x + 1 \u2212 x\u0001yz}1 \u2212 s\u0001 + s{1 \u2212 x \u2212 1 \u2212 x\u0001yz} = 0,\norx + \u00afxyz\u0001\u00afs + s\u00afx1 \u2212 yz\u0001 = 0;\nprovided that for simplicity we write \u00afx for 1 \u2212 x, \u00afy for 1 \u2212 y, and so on.

In like manner we have from the\nsecond equation,\n(y + \u00afyxz)\u00aft + t\u00afy(x\u00afz + \u00afxz + \u00afx\u00afz) = 0;\nand from the sum of these two equations we are to eliminate y and z.\nIf in that sum we make y = 1, z = 1, we get the result \u00afs + \u00aft.\nIf in the same sum we make y = 1, z = 0, we get the result\nx\u00afs + s\u00afx + \u00aft.\nIf in the same sum we make y = 0, z = 1, we get\nx\u00afs + s\u00afx + x\u00aft + t\u00afx.\nAnd if, lastly, in the same sum we make y = 0, z = 0, we find\nx\u00afs + s\u00afx + tx + t\u00afx, or x\u00afs + s\u00afx + t.\nThese four expressions are to be multiplied together. Now the first and third\nmay be multiplied in the following manner:\n(\u00afs + \u00aft)(x\u00afs + s\u00afx + x\u00aft + t\u00afx)\n= x\u00afs + x\u00aft + (\u00afs + \u00aft)(s\u00afx + t\u00afx) by (IX. Prop. ii.)\n= x\u00afs + x\u00aft + \u00afs\u00afxt + s\u00afx\u00aft. (2)\nAgain, the second and fourth give by (IX. Prop. i.)\n(x\u00afs + s\u00afx + \u00aft)(x\u00afs + s\u00afx + t)\n= x\u00afs + s\u00afx. (3)\nLastly, (2) and (3) multiplied together give\n(x\u00afs + s\u00afx)(x\u00afs + s\u00afx\u00aft + x\u00aft + t\u00afx\u00afs)\n= x\u00afs + s\u00afx(s\u00afx\u00aft + x\u00aft + t\u00afx\u00afs)\n= x\u00afs + s\u00afx\u00aft.\nWhence the final equation is\n(1 \u2212 s)x + s(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nwhich, solved with reference to x, gives\nx = s(1 \u2212 t)\ns(1 \u2212 t) \u2212 (1 \u2212 s)\n= 0\n0 st + s(1 \u2212 t) + 0(1 \u2212 s)t + 0(1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t),\nand, proceeding with this according to the rule, we have, finally,\nProb. x = p(1 \u2212 q) + cpq.

Prop, iii.), assume the result of that elimination to be\nEx + E\u2032(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nthen E will be found by making in the given equation x = 1, and eliminating y\nand z from the resulting equation, and E\u2032 will be found by making in the given\nequation x = 0, and eliminating y and z from the result. First, then, making\nx = 1, we have\n\u00afs + (y + \u00afyz)\u00aft + t\u00afy\u00afz + (z + y\u00afz)\u00afu + u\u00afy\u00afz = 0,\nand making in the first member of this equation successively y = 1, z = 1, y =\n1, z = 0, &c., and multiplying together the results, we have the expression\n(\u00afs + \u00aft + \u00afu)(\u00afs + \u00aft + \u00afu)(\u00afs + \u00aft + \u00afu)(\u00afs + t + u),\nwhich is equivalent to\n(\u00afs + \u00aft + \u00afu)(\u00afs + t + u).\nThis is the expression for E. We shall retain it in its present form. It has already\nbeen shown by example (VIII. 3), that the actual reduction of such expressions\nby multiplication, though convenient, is not necessary.\nCHAPTER XVIII.

The values of s, t, and u, are then given by\n(12), and their substitution in (9) completes the solution of the problem.\n10. Now a difficulty, the bringing of which prominently before the reader has\nbeen one object of this investigation, here arises. How shall it be determined,\nwhich root of the above equation ought to taken for the value of \u03bb. To this\ndifficulty some reference was made in the opening of the present chapter, and it\nwas intimated that its fuller consideration was reserved for the next one; from\nwhich the following results are taken.\nIn order that the data of the problem may be derived from a possible\nexperience, the quantities p, q, and r must be subject to the following conditions:\n1 + p \u2212 q \u2212 r =\n> 0,\n1 + q \u2212 p \u2212 r =\n> 0,\n1 + r \u2212 p \u2212 q =\n> 0.\n(14)\nMoreover, the value of \u03bb to be employed in the general solution must satisfy the\nfollowing conditions:\n\u03bb =\n> 1\n1 + p \u2212 q \u2212 r , \u03bb =\n> 1\n1 + q \u2212 p \u2212 r , \u03bb =\n> 1\n1 + r \u2212 p \u2212 q . (15)\nNow these two sets of conditions suffice for the limitation of the general\nsolution. It may be shown, that the central equation (13) furnishes but one\nvalue of \u03bb, which does satisfy these conditions, and that value of \u03bb is the one\nrequired.\nLet 1 + p \u2212 q \u2212 r be the least of the three coefficients of \u03bb given above, then\n1\n1 + p \u2212 q \u2212 r will be the greatest of those values, above which we are to show\nthat there exists but one value of \u03bb. Let us write (13) in the form\n{(1 + p \u2212 q \u2212 r)\u03bb \u2212 1}{(1 + q \u2212 p \u2212 r)\u03bb \u2212 1}{(1 + r \u2212 p \u2212 q)\u03bb \u2212 1}\n\u22124{(p + q + r \u2212 1)\u03bb + 1} = 0; (16)\nCHAPTER XVIII.

Hence it\nwill but once intersect the abscissa \u03bb within those limits; and the equation (16)\nwill, therefore, have but one root thereto corresponding.\nThe solution is, therefore, expressed by (9), \u03bb being that root of (13)\nwhich satisfies the conditions (15), and s, t, and u being given by (12). The\ninterpretation of c may be deduced in the usual way.\nIt appears from the above, that the problem is, in all cases, more or less\nindeterminate.\nChapter XIX\nOF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS.\n1. By the term statistical conditions, I mean those conditions which must\nconnect the numerical data of a problem in order that those data may be\nconsistent with each other, and therefore such as statistical observations might\nactually have furnished. The determination of such conditions constitutes an\nimportant problem, the solution of which, to an extent sufficient at least for\nthe requirements of this work, I purpose to undertake in the present chapter,\nregarding it partly as an independent object of speculation, but partly also as\na necessary supplement to the theory of probabilities already in some degree\nexemplified. The nature of the connexion between the two subjects may be\nstated as follows:\n2. There are innumerable instances, and one of the kind presented itself\nin the last chapter, Ex. 7, in which the solution of a question in the theory\nof probabilities is finally dependent upon the solution of an algebraic equation\nof an elevated degree. In such cases the selection of the proper root must\nbe determined by certain conditions, partly relating to the numerical values\nassigned in the data, partly to the due limitation of the element required. The\ndiscovery of such conditions may sometimes be effected by unaided reasoning.\nFor instance, if there is a probability p of the occurrence of an event A, and a\nprobability q of the concurrence of the said event A, and another event B, it is\nevident that we must have\np =\n> q.\nBut for the general determination of such relations, a distinct method is\nrequired, and this we proceed to establish.\nAs derived from actual experience, the probability of any event is the result\nof a process of approximation. It is the limit of the ratio of the number of cases\nin which the event is observed to occur, to the whole number of equally possible\ncases which observation records,\u2013a limit to which we approach the more nearly\nas the number of observations is increased. Now let the symbol n, prefixed to\nthe expression of any class, represent the number of individuals contained in\n228\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 229\nthat class. Thus, x representing men, and y white beings, let us assume\nnx = number of men.\nnxy = number of white men.\nnx(1 \u2212 y) = number of men who are not white; and so on.\nIn accordance with this notation n(1) will represent the number of individuals\ncontained in the universe of discourse, and n(x)\nn(1) will represent the probability\nthat any individual being, selected out of that universe of being denoted by\nn(1), is a man. If observation has not made us acquainted with the total values\nof n(x) and n(1), then the probability in question is the limit to which n(x)\nn(1)\napproaches as the number of individual observations is increased.\nIn like manner if, as will generally be supposed in this chapter, x represent\nan event of a particular kind observed, n(x) will represent the number of\noccurrences of that event, n(1) the number of observed events (equally probable)\nof all kinds, and n(x)\nn(1) , or its limit, the probability of the occurrence of the event\nx.\nHence it is clear that any conclusions which may be deduced respecting the\nratios of the quantities n(x), n(y), n(1), &c. may be converted into conclusions\nrespecting the probabilities of the events represented by x, y, &c. Thus, if we\nshould find such a relation as the following, viz.,\nn(x) + n(y) < n(1),\nexpressing that the number of times in which the event x occurs and the number\nof times in which the event y occurs, are together less than the number of\npossible occurrences n(1), we might thence deduce the relation,\nn(x)\nn(1) + n(y)\nn(1) < 1,\norProb. x + Prob. y < 1.\nAnd generally any such statistical relations as the above will be converted into\nrelations connecting the probabilities of the events concerned, by changing n(1)\ninto 1, and any other symbol n(x) into Prob. x.\n3. First, then, we shall investigate a method of determining the numerical\nrelations of classes or events, and more particularly the major and minor limits\nof numerical value. Secondly, we shall apply the method to the limitation of the\nsolutions of questions in the theory of probabilities.\nIt is evident that the symbol n is distributive in its operation. Thus we have\nn{xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)} = nxy + n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)\nnx(1 \u2212 y) = nx \u2212 nxy,\nand so on. The number of things contained in any class resolvable into distinct\ngroups or portions is equal to the sum of the numbers of things found in those\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 230\nseparate portions. It is evident, further, that any expression formed of the logical\nsymbols x, y, &c. may be developed or expanded in any way consistent with\nthe laws of the symbols, and the symbol n applied to each term of the result,\nprovided that any constant multiplier which may appear, be placed outside the\nsymbol n; without affecting the value of the result. The expression n(1), should\nit appear, will of course represent the number of individuals contained in the\nuniverse. Thus,\nn(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = n(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y + xy)\n= n(1) \u2212 n(x) \u2212 n(y) + n(xy).\nAgain,n{xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)} = n(l \u2212 x \u2212 y + 2xy)\n= n(1) \u2212 nx \u2212 ny + 2nxy).\nIn the last member the term 2nxy indicates twice the number of individuals\ncontained in the class xy.\n4. We proceed now to investigate the numerical limits of classes whose logical\nexpression is given. In this inquiry the following principles are of fundamental\nimportance:\n1st. If all the members of a given class possess a certain property x, the\ntotal number of individuals contained in the class x will be a superior limit of\nthe number of individuals contained in the given class.\n2nd. A minor limit of the number of individuals in any class y will be found\nby subtracting a major numerical limit of the contrary class, 1 \u2212 y, from the\nnumber of individuals contained in the universe.\nTo exemplify these principles, let us apply them to the following problem:\nProblem.\u2014Given, n(1), n(x), and n(y), required the superior and inferior\nlimits of nxy.\nHere our data are the number of individuals contained in the universe of\ndiscourse, the number contained in the class x, and the number in the class y,\nand it is required to determine the limits of the number contained in the class\ncomposed of the individuals that are found at once in the class x and in the\nclass y.\nBy Principle i. this number cannot exceed the number contained in the class\nx, nor can it exceed the number contained in the class y. Its major limit will\nthen be the least of the two values n(x) and (y).\nBy Principle ii. a minor limit of the class xy will be given by the expression\nn(l) \u2212 major limit of {x(l \u2212 y) + y(l \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)}, (1)\nsince x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) is the complement of the class xy, i.e.\nwhat it wants to make up the universe.\nNow x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 1 \u2212 y. We have therefore for (1),\nn(1) \u2212 major limit of {1 \u2212 y + y1 \u2212 x)}\n= n(1) \u2212 n(l \u2212 y) \u2212 major limit of y(1 \u2212 x).\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 231\nThe major limit of y(l \u2212 x) is the least of the two values n(y) and n(1 \u2212 x). Let\nn(y) be the least, then (2) becomes\nn(1) \u2212 n(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 n(y)\n= n(1) \u2212 n(1) + n(y) \u2212 n(y) = 0.\nSecondly, let n(1 \u2212 x) be less than n(y), then\nmajor limit of ny(1 \u2212 x) = n(1 \u2212 x);\ntherefore (2) becomes\nn(1) \u2212 n(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 n(1 \u2212 x)\n= n(1) \u2212 n(1) + n(y) \u2212 n(1) + n(x)\n= nx + ny \u2212 n(1).\nThe minor limit of nxy is therefore either 0 or n(x) + n(y) \u2212 n(1), according\nas n(y) is less or greater than n(1 \u2212 x), or, which is an equivalent condition,\naccording as n(x) is greater or less than n(1 \u2212 y).\nNow as 0 is necessarily a minor limit of the numerical value of any class, it\nis sufficient to take account of the second of the above expressions for the minor\nlimit of n(xy). We have, therefore,\nMajor limit of n(xy) = least of values n(x) and n(y).\nMinor limit of n(xy) = n(x) + n(y) \u2212 n(1).1\nProposition I.\n5. To express the major and minor limits of a class represented by any\nconstituent of the symbols x, y, z, &c., having given the values of n(x), n(y),\nn(z), &c., and n(1).\nConsider first the constituent xyz.\nIt is evident that the major numerical limit will be the least of the values\nn(x), n(y), n(z).\nThe minor numerical limit may be deduced as in the previous problem, but\nit may also be deduced from the solution of that problem. Thus:\nMinor limit of n(xyz) = n(xy) + n(z) \u2212 n(1). (1)\n1The above expression for the minor limit of nxy is applied by Professor De Morgan, by\nwhom it appears to have been first given, to the syllogistic form:\nMost men in a certain company have coats.\nMost men in the same company have waistcoats.\nTherefore some in the company have coats and waistcoats.\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 232\nNow this means that n(xyz) is at least as great as the expression n(xy) + n(z) \u2212\nn(1). But n(xy) is at least as great as n(x) + n(y) \u2212 n(1). Therefore n(xyz) is\nat least as great as\nn(x) + n(y) \u2212 n(1) + n(z) \u2212 n(1),\nor n(x) + n(y) + n(z) \u2212 2n(1).\nHence we have\nMinor limit of n(xyz) = n(x) + n(y) + n(z) \u2212 2n(1).\nBy extending this mode of reasoning we shall arrive at the following\nconclusions:\n1st. The major numerical limit of the class represented by any constituent\nwill be found by prefixing n separately to each factor of the constituent, and\ntaking the least of the resulting values.\n2nd. The minor limit will be found by adding all the values above mentioned\ntogether, and subtracting from the result as many, less one, times the value of\nn(1).\nThus we should have\nMajor limit of nxy(1 \u2212 z) = least of the values nx, ny, and n(1 \u2212 z).\nMinor limit of nxy(1 \u2212 z) = n(x) + n(y) + n(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 2n(1)\n= nx + n(y) \u2212 n(z) \u2212 n(1).\nIn the use of general symbols it is perhaps better to regard all the values\nn(x), n(y), n(1 \u2212 z), as major limits of n{xy(1 \u2212 z)}, since, in fact, it cannot\nexceed any of them. I shall in the following investigations adopt this mode of\nexpression.\nProposition II.\n6. To determine the major numerical limit of a class expressed by a series\nof constituents of the symbols x, y, z, &c., the values of n(x), n(y), n(z), &c.,\nand n(1), being given.\nEvidently one mode of determining such a limit would be to form the least\npossible sum of the major limits of the several constituents. Thus a major limit\nof the expression\nn{xy + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)}\nwould be found by adding the least of the two values nx, ny, furnished by the\nfirst constituent, to the least of the two values n(1 \u2212 x), n(1 \u2212 y), furnished by\nthe second constituent. If we do not know which is in each case the least value,\nwe must form the four possible sums, and reject any of these which are equal to\nor exceed n(1). Thus in the above example we should have\nnx + n(l \u2212 x) = n(l).\nn(x) + n(1 \u2212 y) = n(1) + n(x) \u2212 n(y).\nn(y) + n(l \u2212 y) = n(l) + n(y) \u2212 n(x).\nn(y) + n(1 \u2212 y) = n(1).\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 233\nRejecting the first and last of the above values, we have\nn(1) + n(x) \u2212 n(y), and n(1) + n(y) \u2212 n(x),\nfor the expressions required, one of which will (unless nx = ny) be less than\nn(l), and the other greater. The least must of course be taken.\nWhen two or more of the constituents possess a common factor, as x, that\nfactor can only, as is obvious from Principle i., furnish a single term n(x) in the\nfinal expression of the major limit. Thus if n(x) appear as a major limit in two\nor more constituents, we must, in adding those limits together, replace nx + nx\nby nx, and so on. Take, for example, the expression n{xy + x(1 \u2212 y)z}. The\nmajor limits of this expression, immediately furnished by addition, would be\u2014\n1. nx. 4. ny + nx.\n2. nx + n(1 \u2212 y). 5. ny + n(1 \u2212 y).\n3. nx + n(z). 6. ny + nz.\nOf these the first and sixth only need be retained; the second, third, and fourth\nbeing greater than the first; and the fifth being equal to n(1). The limits are\ntherefore\nn(x) and n(y) + n(z),\nand of these two values the last, supposing it to be less than n(1), must be\ntaken.\nThese considerations lead us to the following Rule:\nRule.\u2014Take one factor from each constituent, and prefix to it the symbol\nn, add the several terms or results thus formed together, rejecting all repetitions\nof the same term; the sum thus obtained will be a major limit of the expression,\nand the least of all such sums will be the major limit to be employed.\nThus the major limits of the expression\nxyz + x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z)\nwould be\nn(x) + n(1 \u2212 y), and n(x) + n(1 \u2212 z),\norn(x) + n(1) \u2212 n(y), and n(x) + n(1) \u2212 n(z).\nIf we began with n(y), selected from the first term, and took n(x) from the\nsecond, we should have to take n(1 \u2212 y) from the third term, and this would\ngive\nn(y) + n(x) + n(1 \u2212 y), or n(1) + n(x).\nBut as this result exceeds n(1), which is an obvious major limit to every class,\nit need not be taken into account.\nProposition III.\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 234\n7. To find the minor numerical limit of any class expressed by constituents\nof the symbols x, y, z, having given n(x), n(y), n(z) . . . n(1).\nThis object may be effected by the application of the preceding Proposition,\ncombined with Principle ii., but it is better effected by the following method:\nLet any two constituents, which differ from one another only by a single\nfactor, be added, so as to form a single class term as x(1 \u2212 y) + xy form x,\nand this species of aggregation having been carried on as far as possible, i.e.,\nthere having been selected out of the given series of constituents as many sums\nof this kind as can be formed, each such sum comprising as many constituents\nas can be collected into a single term, without regarding whether any of the\nsaid constituents enter into the composition of other terms, let these ultimate\naggregates, together with those constituents which do not admit of being thus\nadded together, be written down as distinct terms. Then the several minor limits\nof those terms, deduced by Prop. I., will be the minor limits of the expression\ngiven, and one only of those minor limits will at the same time be positive.\nThus from the expression xy + (1 \u2212 x)y + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) we can form the\naggregates y and 1 \u2212 x, by respectively adding the first and second terms\ntogether, and the second and third. Hence n(y) and n(1 \u2212 x) will be the minor\nlimits of the expression given. Again, if the expression given were\nxyz + x(1 \u2212 y)z + (1 \u2212 x)yz + (l \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)z\n+ xy(1 \u2212 z) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z),\nwe should obtain by addition of the first four terms the single term z, by addition\nof the first and fifth term the single term xy, and by addition of the fourth and\nsixth terms the single term (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y); and there is no other way in which\nconstituents can be collected into single terms, nor are there are any constituents\nleft which have not been thus taken account of. The three resulting terms give,\nas the minor limits of the given expression, the values\nn(z), n(x) + n(y) \u2212 n(1),\nandn(1 \u2212 x) + n(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 n(1), or n(1) \u2212 n(x) \u2212 n(y).\n8. The proof of the above rule consists in the proper application of the\nfollowing principles: \u2014 1st. The minor limit of any collection of constituents\nwhich admit of being added into a single term, will obviously be the minor\nlimit of that single term. This explains the first part of the rule. 2nd. The\nminor limit of the sum of any two terms which either are distinct constituents,\nor consist of distinct constituents, but do not admit of being added together,\nwill be the sum of their respective minor limits, if those minor limits are both\npositive; but if one be positive, and the other negative, it will be equal to the\npositive minor limit alone. For if the negative one were added, the value of the\nlimit would be diminished, i. e. it would be less for the sum of two terms than\nfor a single term. Now whenever two constituents differ in more than one factor,\nso as not to admit of being added together, the minor limits of the two cannot\nbe both positive. Thus let the terms be xyz and (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)z, which differ in\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 235\ntwo factors, the minor limit of the first is n(x + y + z \u2212 2), that of the second\nn(1 \u2212 x + 1 \u2212 y + z \u2212 2), or,\n1st. n{x + y \u2212 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 z)}. 2nd. n{1 \u2212 x \u2212 y \u2212 (1 \u2212 z)}.\nIf n(x + y \u2212 1) is positive, n(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y) is negative, and the second must be\nnegative. If n(x + y \u2212 1) is negative, the first is negative; and similarly for cases\nin which a larger number of factors are involved. It may in this manner be\nshown that, according to the mode in which the aggregate terms are formed in\nthe application of the rule, no two minor limits of distinct terms can be added\ntogether, for either those terms will involve some common constituent, in which\ncase it is clear that we cannot add their minor limits together,\u2014or the minor\nlimits of the two will not be both positive, in which case the addition would be\nuseless.\nProposition IV.\n9. Given the respective numbers of individuals comprised in any classes, s,\nt, &c. logically defined, to deduce a system, of numerical limits of any other\nclass w, also logically defined.\nAs this is the most general problem which it is meant to discuss in the\npresent chapter, the previous inquiries being merely introductory to it, and the\nsucceeding ones occupied with its application, it is desirable to state clearly its\nnature and design.\nWhen the classes s, t . . . w are said to be logically defined, it is meant that\nthey are classes so defined as to enable us to write down their symbolical\nexpressions, whether the classes in question be simple or compound. By the\ngeneral method of this treatise, the symbol w can then be determined directly\nas a developed function of the symbols s, t, &c. in the form\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D, (1)\nwherein A, B, C, and D are formed of the constituents of s, t, &c. How from\nsuch an expression the numerical limits of w may in the most general manner\nbe determined, will be considered hereafter. At present we merely purpose\nto show how far this object can be accomplished on the principles developed\nin the previous propositions; such an inquiry being sufficient for the purposes\nof this work. For simplicity, I shall found my argument upon the particular\ndevelopment,\nw = st + 0s(1 \u2212 t) + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 s)t + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t), (2)\nin which all the varieties of coefficients present themselves.\nOf the constituent (1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t), which has for its coefficient 0\n0 , it is implied\nthat some, none, or all of the class denoted by that constituent are found in\nw. It is evident that n(w) will have its highest numerical value when all the\nmembers of the class denoted by (1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 f ) are found in w. Moreover, as\nnone of the individuals contained in the classes denoted by s(1 \u2212 t) and (1 \u2212 s)t\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 236\nare found in w, the superior numerical limits of w will be identical with those\nof the class st + (1 \u2212 s)(1 \u2212 t). They are, therefore,\nns + n(1 \u2212 t) and nt + n(1 \u2212 s).\nIn like manner a system of superior numerical limits of the development A +\n0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D, may be found from those of A + C by Prop. 2.\nAgain, any minor numerical limit of w will, by Principle ii., be given by the\nexpression\nn(1) \u2212 major limit of n(1 \u2212 w),\nbut the development of w being given by (1), that of 1 \u2212 w will obviously be\n1 \u2212 w = 0A + B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D.\nThis may be directly proved by the method of Prop. 2, Chap. x. Hence\nMinor limit of n(w) = n(1) \u2212 major limit (B + C)\n= minor limit of (A + D),\nby Principle ii., since the classes A + D and B + C are supplementary. Thus\nthe minor limit of the second member of (2) would be n(t), and, generalizing\nthis mode of reasoning, we have the following result:\nA system of minor limits of the development\nA + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D\nwill be given by the minor limits of A + D.\nThis result may also be directly inferred. For of minor numerical limits we\nare bound to seek the greatest. Now we obtain in general a higher minor limit\nby connecting the class D with A in the expression of w, a combination which,\nas shown in various examples of the Logic we are permitted to make, than we\notherwise should obtain.\nFinally, as the concluding term of the development of w indicates the\nequation D = 0, it is evident that n(D) = 0. Hence we have\nMinor limit of n(D) =\n< 0,\nand this equation, treated by Prop. 3, gives the requisite conditions among the\nnumerical elements n(s), n(t), &c., in order that the problem may be real, and\nmay embody in its data the results of a possible experience,\nThus from the term 1\n0 (1 \u2212 s)t in the second member of (2) we should deduce\nn(1 \u2212 s) + n(t) \u2212 n(1) =\n< 0,\n\u2234 n(t) =\n< n(s).\nThese conclusions may be embodied in the following rule:\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 237\n10. Rule.\u2014Determine the expression of the class w as a developed logical\nfunction of the symbols s, t, &c. in the form\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D.\nThen will\nMaj. lim. w = Maj. lim. A + C.\nMin. lim. w = Min. lim. A + D.\nThe necessary numerical conditions among the data being given by the inequality\nMin. lim. D =\n< n(1).\nTo apply the above method to the limitation of the solutions of questions\nin probabilities, it is only necessary to replace in each of the formula n(x) by\nProb. x, n(y) by Prob. y, &c., and, finally, n(1) by 1. The application being,\nhowever, of great importance, it may be desirable to exhibit in the form of a\nrule the chief results of transformation.\n11. Given the probabilities of any events s, t, &c., whereof another event w\nis a developed logical function, in the form\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D,\nrequired the systems of superior and inferior limits of Prob. w, and the\nconditions among the data.\nSolution.\u2014The superior limits of Prob. (A + C), and the inferior limits of\nProb. (A + D) will form two such systems as are sought. The conditions among\nthe constants in the data will be given by the inequality,\nInf. lim. Prob. D =\n< 0.\nIn the application of these principles we have always\nInf. lim. Prob. x1x2 . . . xn = Prob. x1 + Prob. x2 . . . + Prob. xn \u2212 (n \u2212 1).\nMoreover, the inferior limits can only be determined from single terms, either\ngiven or formed by aggregation. Superior limits are included in the formP Prob. x, Prob. x applying only to symbols which are different, and are\ntaken from different terms in the expression whose superior limit is sought.\nThus the superior limits of Prob. xyz + x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) are\nProb. x, Prob. y + Prob. (1 \u2212 z), and Prob. z + Prob. (1 \u2212 y).\nLet it be observed, that if in the last case we had taken Prob. z from the first\nterm, and Prob. (1 \u2212 z) from the second,\u2014a connexion not forbidden,\u2014we\nshould have had as their sum 1, which as a result would be useless because `a\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 238\npriori necessary. It is obvious that we may reject any limits which do not fall\nbetween 0 and 1.\nLet us apply this method to Ex. 7, Case iii. of the last chapter.\nThe final logical solution is\nx = 0\n0 stu + 1\n0 s\u00aftu + 1\n0 st\u00afu + s\u00aft\u00afu\n+ 1\n0 \u00afstu + 0\u00afs\u00aftu + 0\u00afst\u00afu + 0\u00afs\u00aft\u00afu,\nthe data being\nProb. s = p, Prob. t = q, Prob. u = r.\nWe shall seek both the numerical limits of x, and the conditions connecting\np, q, and r. The superior limits of x are, according to the rule, given by those\nof stu + s\u00aft\u00afu. They are, therefore,\np, q + 1 \u2212 r, r + 1 \u2212 q.\nThe inferior limits of x are given by those of\ns\u00aftu + st\u00afu + s\u00aft\u00afu + \u00afstu.\nWe may collect the first and third of these constituents in the single term\ns\u00aft, and the second and third in the single term s\u00afu. The inferior limits of x must\nthen be deduced separately from the terms s(1 \u2212 t), s(1 \u2212 u), (1 \u2212 s)tu, which\ngive\np + 1 \u2212 q \u2212 1, p + 1 \u2212 r \u2212 1, 1 \u2212 p + q + r \u2212 2,\nor p \u2212 q, p \u2212 r, and q + r \u2212 p \u2212 1.\nFinally, the conditions among the constants p, q, and r, are given by the\nterms\ns\u00aftu, st\u00afu, \u00afstu,\nfrom which, by the rule, we deduce\np + 1 \u2212 q + r \u2212 2 =\n< 0, p + q + 1 \u2212 r \u2212 2 =\n< 0, 1 \u2212 p + q + r \u2212 2 =\n< 0.\nor 1 + q \u2212 p \u2212 r =\n> 0, 1 + r \u2212 p \u2212 q =\n> 0, 1 + p \u2212 q \u2212 r =\n> 0.\nThese are the limiting conditions employed in the analysis of the final solution.\nThe conditions by which in that solution \u03bb is limited, were determined, however,\nsimply from the conditions that the quantities s, t, and u should be positive.\nNarrower limits of that quantity might, in all probability, have been deduced\nfrom the above investigation.\n12. The following application is taken from an important problem, the\nsolution of which will be given in the next chapter. There are given,\nProb. x = c1, Prob. y = c2, Prob. s = c1p1, Prob. t = c2p2,\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 239\ntogether with the logical equation\nz = stxy + s\u00aftx\u00afy + \u00afst\u00afxy + 0\u00afs\u00aft\n+ 1\n0\n(stx\u00afy + st\u00afxy + st\u00afx\u00afy + s\u00aftxy + s\u00aft\u00afxy\n+s\u00aft\u00afx\u00afy + \u00afstxy + \u00afstx\u00afy + \u00afst\u00afx\u00afy;\nand it is required to determine the conditions among the constants c1, c2, p1,\np2, and the major and minor limits of z.\nFirst let us seek the conditions among the constants. Confining our attention\nto the terms whose coefficients are 1\n0 , we readily form, by the aggregation of\nconstituents, the following terms, viz.:\ns(1 \u2212 x), t(1 \u2212 y), sy(1 \u2212 t), tx(1 \u2212 s);\nnor can we form any other terms which are not included under these. Hence\nthe conditions among the constants are,\nn(s) + n(1 \u2212 x) \u2212 n(1) =\n< 0,\nn(t) + n(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 n(1) =\n< 0,\nn(s) + n(y) + n(1 \u2212 t) \u2212 2n(1) =\n< 0,\nn(t) + n(x) + n(1 \u2212 s) \u2212 2n(1) =\n< 0.\nNow replace n(x) by c1, n(y) by c2, n(s) by c1p1, n(t) by c2p2, and n(1) by\n1, and we have, after slight reductions,\nc1p1\n=\n< c1, c2p2\n=\n< c2,\nc1p1\n=\n< 1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2), c2p2\n=\n< 1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1).\nSuch are, then, the requisite conditions among the constants.\nAgain, the major limits of z are identical with those of the expression\nstxy + s(1 \u2212 t)x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 s)t(1 \u2212 x)y;\nwhich, if we bear in mind the conditions\nn(s) =\n< n(x), n(t) =\n< n(y),\nabove determined, will be found to be\nn(s) + n(t), or, c1p1 + c2p2,\nn(s) + n(1 \u2212 x), or, 1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1)n(t) + n(1 \u2212 y), or, 1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2).\nLastly, to ascertain the minor limits of z, we readily form from the\nconstituents, whose coefficients are 1 or 1\n0 , the single terms s and t, nor can any\nother terms not included under these be formed by selection or aggregation.\nHence, for the minor limits of z we have the values c1p1 and c2p2.\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 240\n13. It is to be observed, that the method developed above does not always\nassign the narrowest limits which it is possible to determine. But it in all\ncases, I believe, sufficiently limits the solutions of questions in the theory of\nprobabilities.\nThe problem of the determination of the narrowest limits of numerical\nextension of a class is, however, always reducible to a purely algebraical form.2\nThus, resuming the equations\nw = A + 0B + 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D,\nlet the highest inferior numerical limit of w be represented by the formula an(s)+\nbn(t) . . . + dn(1), wherein a, b, c, . . . d are numerical constants to be determined,\nand s, t, &c., the logical symbols of which A, B, C, D are constituents. Then\nan(s) + bn(t) . . . + dn(1) = minor limit of A subject\nto the condition D = 0.\nHence if we develop the function\nas + bt . . . + d,\nreject from the result all constituents which are found in D, the coefficients of\nthose constituents which remain, and are found also in A, ought not individually\nto exceed unity in value, and the coefficients of those constituents which remain,\nand which are not found in A, should individually not exceed 0 in value. Hence\nwe shall have a series of inequalities of the form f =\n< 1, and another series of the\nform g =\n< 0, f and g being linear functions of a, b, c, &c. Then those values of\na, b . . . d, which, while satisfying the above conditions, give to the function\nan(s) + bn(t) . . . + dn(1),\nits highest value must be determined, and the highest value in question will be\nthe highest minor limit of w. To the above we may add the relations similarly\nformed for the determination of the relations among the given constants\nn(s), n(t) . . . n(1).\n14. The following somewhat complicated example will show how the\nlimitation of a solution is effected, when the problem involves an arbitrary\nelement, constituting it the representative of a system of problems agreeing in\ntheir data, but unlimited in their qu\u00e6sita.\nProblem.\u2014Of n events x1 x2 . . . xn, the following particulars are known:\n1st. The probability that either the event x1 will occur, or all the events\nfail, is p1.\n2The author regrets the loss of a manuscript, written about four years ago, in which this\nmethod, he believes, was developed at considerable length. His recollection of the contents is\nalmost entirely confined to the impression that the principle of the method was the same as\nabove described, and that its sufficiency was proved. The prior methods of this chapter are,\nit is almost needless to say, easier, though certainly less general.\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 241\n2nd. The probability that either the event x2 will occur, or all the events\nfail, is p2. And so on for the others.\nIt is required to find the probability of any single event, or combination of\nevents, represented by the general functional form \u03d5(x1 . . . xn), or \u03d5.\nAdopting a previous notation, the data of the problem are\nProb. (x1 + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn) = p1 . . . Prob. (xn + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn) = pn.\nAnd Prob. \u03d5(x1 . . . xn) is required.\nAssume generally\nxr + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn = sr , (1)\n\u03d5 = w. (2)\nWe hence obtain the collective logical equation of the problem\nX\bxr + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn\n\u0001\u00afsr + sr\n\u00afxr \u2212 \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn\n\u0001 + \u03d5 \u00afw + w \u00af\u03d5 = 0. (3)\nFrom this equation we must eliminate the symbols x1, . . . xn, and determine w\nas a developed logical function of s1 . . . sn.\nLet us represent the result of the aforesaid elimination in the form\nEw + E\u2032(1 \u2212 w) = 0;\nthen will E be the result of the elimination of the same symbols from the\nequation\nX\bxr + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn\n\u0001\u00afsr + sr\n\u00afxr \u2212 \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn\n\u0001 + 1 \u2212 \u03d5 = 0. (4)\nNow E will be the product of the coefficients of all the constituents\n(considered with reference to the symbols x1, x2 . . . xn) which are found in\nthe development of the first member of the above equation. Moreover, \u03d5, and\ntherefore 1 \u2212 \u03d5, will consist of a series of such constituents, having unity for\ntheir respective coefficients. In determining the forms of the coefficients in the\ndevelopment of the first member of (4), it will be convenient to arrange them\nin the following manner:\n1st. The coefficients of constituents found in 1 \u2212 \u03d5.\n2nd. The coefficient of \u00afx1, \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn, if found in \u03d5.\n3rd. The coefficients of constituents found in \u03d5, excluding the constituent\n\u00afx1, \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn.\nThe above is manifestly an exhaustive classification.\nFirst then; the coefficient of any constituent found in 1 \u2212 \u03d5, will, in the\ndevelopment of the first member of (4), be of the form\n1 + positive terms derived from X .\nHence, every such coefficient may be replaced by unity, Prop. i.

OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 242\nSecondly; the coefficient of \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn, if found in \u03d5, in the development of the\nfirst member of (4) will be\nX \u00afsr , or \u00afs1 + \u00afs2 . . . + \u00afsn\nThirdly; the coefficient of any other constituent, x1 . . . xi, \u00afxi+1 . . . \u00afxn, found\nin \u03d5, in the development of the first member of (4) will be \u00afs1 . . . \u00afsi +si+1 . . .+sn.\nNow it is seen, that E is the product of all the coefficients above determined;\nbut as the coefficients of those constituents which are not found in \u03d5 reduce to\nunity, E may be regarded as the product of the coefficients of those constituents\nwhich are found in \u03d5. From the mode in which those coefficients are formed,\nwe derive the following rule for the determination of E, viz., in each constituent\nfound in \u03d5, except the constituent \u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn, for x1 write \u00afs1, for \u00afxl write s1,\nand so on, and add the results; but for the constituent \u00afx1, \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn, if it occur\nin \u03d5, write \u00afs1 + \u00afs2 . . . + \u00afsn, the product of all these sums is E.\nTo find E\u2032 we must in (3) make w = 0, and eliminate x1, x2 . . . xn, from the\nreduced equation. That equation will be\nX\bxr + \u00afx1 . . . + \u00afxn\n\u0001\u00afsr + sr\n\u00afxr \u2212 \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn\n\u0001 + \u03d5 = 0. (5)\nHence E\u2032 will be formed from the constituents in 1\u2212\u03d5, i. e. from the constituents\nnot found in \u03d5 in the same way as E is formed from the constituents found in\n\u03d5.\nConsider next the equation\nEw + E\u2032(1 \u2212 w) = 0.\nThis gives\nw = E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E . (6)\nNow E and E\u2032 are functions of the symbols s1, s2 . . . sn. The expansion\nof the value of w will, therefore, consist of all the constituents which can be\nformed out of those symbols, with their proper coefficients annexed to them, as\ndetermined by the rule of development.\nMoreover, E and E\u2032 are each formed by the multiplication of factors, and\nneither of them can vanish unless some one of the factors of which it is composed\nvanishes. Again, any factor, as \u00afs1 . . . + \u00afsn can only vanish when all the terms\nby the addition of which it is formed vanish together, since in development we\nattribute to these terms the values 0 and 1, only. It is further evident, that\nno two factors differing from each other can vanish together. Thus the factors\n\u00afs1 + \u00afs2 . . . + \u00afsn, and s1 + \u00afs2 . . . + \u00afsn, cannot simultaneously vanish, for the\nformer cannot vanish unless \u00afs1 = 0, or s1 = 1; but the latter cannot vanish\nunless s1 = 0.\nFirst, let us determine the coefficient of the constituent \u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn in the\ndevelopment of the value of w.\nThe simultaneous assumption \u00afs1 = 1, \u00afs2 = 1 . . . \u00afsn = 1, would cause the\nfactor s1 + s2 . . . + sn to vanish if this should occur in E or E\u2032; and no other\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 243\nfactor under the same assumption would vanish; but s1 + s2 . . . + sn does not\noccur as a factor of either E or E\u2032; neither of these quantities, therefore, can\nvanish; and, therefore, the expression E\u2032\nE\u2032\u2212E , is neither 1, 0, nor 0\n0 .\nWherefore the coefficient of \u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn in the expanded value of w, may be\nrepresented by 1\n0 .\nSecondly, let us determine the coefficient of the constituent s1 s2 . . . sn. The\nassumptions s1 = 1, s2 = 1, . . . sn = 1, would cause the factor \u00afs1 + \u00afs2 . . . + \u00afsn to\nvanish. Now this factor is found in E and not in E\u2032 whenever \u03d5 contains both\nthe constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and \u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn. Here then E\u2032\nE\u2032\u2212E becomes E\u2032\nE\u2032 or\n1. The factor \u00afs1 + \u00afs2 . . . + \u00afsn is found in E\u2032 and not in E, if \u03d5 contains neither\nof the constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and \u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn. Here then E\u2032\nE\u2032\u2212E becomes 0\n\u2212E\nor 0. Lastly, the factor \u00afs1 + \u00afs2 . . . + \u00afsn is contained in both E and E\u2032, if one of\nthe constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and \u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn is found in \u03d5, and one is not. Here\nthen E\u2032\nE\u2032\u2212E becomes 0\n0 .\nThe coefficient of the constituent s1 s2 . . . sn, will therefore be 1, 0, or 0\n0 ,\naccording as \u03d5 contains both the constituents x1 x2 . . . xn and \u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn, or\nneither of them, or one of them and not the other.\nLastly, to determine the coefficient of any other constituent as s1 . . . si\n\u00afsi+1 . . . \u00afsn.\nThe assumptions s1 = 1, . . . si = 1, si+1 = 0, sn = 0, would cause the\nfactor \u00afs1 . . . + \u00afsi + si+1 . . . + sn to vanish. Now this factor is found in E, if the\nconstituent x1 . . . xi \u00afxi+1 . . . \u00afxn is found in \u03d5 and in E\u2032, if the said constituent\nis not found in \u03d5. In the former case we have E\u2032\nE\u2032\u2212E = E\u2032\nE\u2032 = 1; in the latter case\nwe have E\u2032\nE\u2032\u2212E = 0\n0\u2212E = 0.\nHence the coefficient of any other constituent s1 . . . si, \u00afsi+1 . . . \u00afsn is 1 or 0\naccording as the similar constituent x1 . . . xi \u00afxi+1 . . . \u00afxn is or is not found in \u03d5.\nWe may, therefore, practically determine the value of w in the following\nmanner. Rejecting from the given expression of \u03d5 the constituents x1 x2 . . . xc\nand \u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn, should both or either of them be contained in it, let the symbols\nx1, x2, . . . xn, in the result be changed into s1, s2, . . . sn respectively. Let\nthe coefficients of the constituents s1 s2 . . . sn and \u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn be determined\naccording to the special rules for those cases given above, and let every other\nconstituent have for its coefficient 0. The result will be the value of w as a\nfunction of s1, s2, . . . sn.\nAs a particular case, let \u03d5 = x1. It is required from the given data to\ndetermine the probability of the event x1.\nThe symbol x1 expanded in terms of the entire series of symbols x1, x2, . . . xn,\nwill generate all the constituents of those symbols which have x1 as a factor.\nAmong those constituents will be found the constituent x1 x2 . . . xn, but not\nthe constituent \u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn.\nHence in the expanded value of x1 as a function of the symbols s1, s2, . . . sn,\nthe constituent s1 s2 . . . sn will have the coefficient 0\n0 , and the constituent\n\u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn the coefficient 1\n0 .\nIf from x1 we reject the constituent x1 x2 . . . xn, the result will be x1 \u2212\nx1x2 . . . xn, and changing therein x1 into s1 &c., we have s1 \u2212 s1s2 . . . sn for the\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 244\ncorresponding portion of the expression of x1 as a function of s1, s2, . . . sn.\nHence the final expression for x1 is\nx1 = s1 \u2212 s1s2 . . . sn + 0\n0 s1s2 . . . sn + 1\n0 \u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn\n+ constituents whose coefficients are 0.\n(7)\nThe sum of all the constituents in the above expansion whose coefficients\nare either 1, 0, or 0\n0 , will be 1 \u2212 \u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn.\nWe shall, therefore, have the following algebraic system for the determination\nof Prob. x1, viz.:\nProb. x1 = s1 \u2212 s1s2 . . . sn + cs1s2 . . . sn\n1 \u2212 \u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn\n, (8)\nwith the relations\ns1\np1\n= s2\np2\n. . . = sn\npn\n= 1 \u2212 \u00afs1 \u00afs2 . . . \u00afsn = \u03bb.\n(9)\nIt will be seen, that the relations for the determination of s1 s2 . . . sn are quite\nindependent of the form of the function \u03d5, and the values of these quantities,\ndetermined once, will serve for all possible problems in which the data are the\nsame, however the qu\u00e6sita of those problems may vary. The nature of that\nevent, or combination of events, whose probability is sought, will affect only the\nform of the function in which the determined values of s1 s2 . . . sn are to be\nsubstituted. We have from (9)\ns1 = p1\u03bb, s2 = p2\u03bb, . . . sn = pn\u03bb.\nWhence\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p1\u03bb)(1 \u2212 p2\u03bb) . . . (1 \u2212 pn\u03bb) = \u03bb.\nOr,\n1 \u2212 \u03bb = (1 \u2212 p1\u03bb)(1 \u2212 p2\u03bb) . . . (1 \u2212 pn\u03bb); (10)\nfrom which equation the value of \u03bb is to be determined.\nSupposing this value determined, the value of Prob. x1 will be\np1\u03bb \u2212 (1 \u2212 c)p1p2 . . . pn\u03bbn\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p1\u03bb)(1 \u2212 p2\u03bb) . . . (1 \u2212 pn\u03bb) ,\nor, on reduction by (10),\nProb. x1 = p1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 c)p1p2 . . . pn\u03bbn\u22121. (11)\nLet us next seek the conditions which must be fulfilled among the constants\np1, p2, . . . pn, and the limits of the value of Prob. x1.\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 245\nAs there is but one term with the coefficient 1\n0 , there is but one condition\namong the constants, viz.,\nMinor limit, (1 \u2212 s1)(1 \u2212 s2) . . . (1 \u2212 sn) =\n< 0.\nOr, n(1 \u2212 s1) + n(1 \u2212 s2) . . . + n(1 \u2212 sn) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)n(1) =\n< 0.\nOr, n(1) \u2212 n(s1) \u2212 n(s2) . . . \u2212 n(sn) =\n< 0.\nWhence p1 + p2 . . . + pn\n=\n> 1,\nthe condition required.\nThe major limit of Prob. x1 is the major limit of the sum of those\nconstituents whose coefficients are 1 or 0\n0 . But that sum is s1.\nHence,\nMajor limit, Prob. x1 = major limit s1 = p1.\nThe minor limit of Prob. x1 will be identical with the minor limit of the\nexpression\ns1 \u2212 s1s2 . . . sn + (1 \u2212 s1)(1 \u2212 s2) . . . (1 \u2212 sn).\nA little attention will show that the different aggregates, terms which can\nbe formed out of the above, each including the greatest possible number of\nconstituents, will be the following, viz.:\ns1(1 \u2212 s2), s1(1 \u2212 s3), . . . s1(1 \u2212 sn), (1 \u2212 s2)(1 \u2212 s3) . . . (1 \u2212 sn).\nFrom these we deduce the following expressions for the minor limit, viz.:\np1 \u2212 p2, p1 \u2212 p3 . . . p1 \u2212 pn, 1 \u2212 p2 \u2212 p3 . . . \u2212 pn.\nThe value of Prob. x1 will, therefore, not fall short of any of these values,\nnor exceed the value of p1.\nInstead, however, of employing these conditions, we may directly avail\nourselves of the principle stated in the demonstration of the general method\nin probabilities. The condition that s1, s2, . . . sn must each be less than unity,\nrequires that \u03bb should be less than each of the quantities 1\np1 , 1\np2 , . . . 1\npn . And the\ncondition that s1, s2, . . . sn, must each be greater than 0, requires that \u03bb should\nalso be greater than 0. Now p1 p2 . . . pn being proper fractions satisfying the\ncondition\np1 + p2 . . . + pn > 1,\nit may be shown that but one positive value of \u03bb can be deduced from the central\nequation (10) which shall be less than each of the quantities 1\np1 , 1\np2 , . . . 1\npn . That\nvalue of \u03bb is, therefore, the one required.\nTo prove this, let us consider the equation\n(1 \u2212 p1\u03bb)(1 \u2212 p2\u03bb) . . . (1 \u2212 pn\u03bb) \u2212 1 + \u03bb = 0.\nWhen \u03bb = 0 the first member vanishes, and the equation is satisfied. Let\nus examine the variations of the first member between the limits \u03bb = 0 and\nCHAPTER XIX. OF STATISTICAL CONDITIONS. 246\n\u03bb = 1\np1 , supposing p1 the greatest of the values p1 p2 . . . pn. Representing the\nfirst member of the equation by V , we have\ndV\nd\u03bb = \u2212p1(1 \u2212 p2\u03bb) . . . (1 \u2212 pn\u03bb) . . . \u2212 pn(1 \u2212 p1\u03bb) . . . (1 \u2212 pn\u22121\u03bb) + 1,\nwhich, when \u03bb = 0, assumes the form \u2212p1 \u2212 p2 . . . \u2212 pn + 1, and is negative in\nvalue.\nAgain, we have\nd2V\nd\u03bb2 = p1p2(1 \u2212 p3\u03bb)(1 \u2212 pn\u03bb) + &c.,\nconsisting of a series of terms which, under the given restrictions with reference\nto the value of \u03bb, are positive.\nLastly, when \u03bb = 1\np1 , we have\nV = \u22121 + 1\np1\n,\nwhich is positive.\nFrom all this it appears, that if we construct a curve, the ordinates of which\nshall represent the value of V corresponding to the abscissa \u03bb, that curve will\npass through the origin, and will for small values of \u03bb lie beneath the abscissa.\nIts convexity will, between the limits \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 1\np1 be downwards, and\nat the extreme limit 1\np1 the curve will be above the abscissa, its ordinate being\npositive. It follows from this description, that it will intersect the abscissa once,\nand only once, within the limits specified, viz., between the values \u03bb = 0, and\n\u03bb = 1\np1 .\nThe solution of the problem is, therefore, expressed by (11), the value of\n\u03bb being that root of the equation (10), which lies within the limits 0 and\n1\np1 , 1\np2 , . . . 1\npn .\nThe constant c is obviously the probability, that if the events x1, x2, . . . xn,\nall happen, or all fail, they will all happen.\nThis determination of the value of \u03bb suffices for all problems in which the data\nare the same as in the one just considered. It is, as from previous discussions we\nare prepared to expect, a determination independent of the form of the function\n\u03d5. Let us, as another example, suppose\n\u03d5 = or w = x1(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn) . . . + xn(1 \u2212 x1) . . . (1 \u2212 xn\u22121).\nThis is equivalent to requiring the probability, that of the events x1, x2, . . . xn\none, and only one, will happen. The value of w will obviously be\nw = s1(1 \u2212 s2) . . . (1 \u2212 sn) . . . + sn(1 \u2212 s1) . . . (1 \u2212 sn\u22121) + 1\n0 (1 \u2212 s1) . . . (1 \u2212 sn),\nCHAPTER XIX.

The central equation by which \u03bb\nis determined, and the peculiar discussions connected therewith, are equally\npertinent to every form which that problem can be made to assume, by varying\nthe interpretation of the arbitrary elements in its original statement.\nChapter XX\nPROBLEMS RELATING TO THE CONNEXION OF\nCAUSES AND EFFECTS.\n1. So to apprehend in all particular instances the relation of cause and effect, as\nto connect the two extremes in thought according to the order in which they are\nconnected in nature (for the modus operandi is, and must ever be, unknown to\nus), is the final object of science. This treatise has shown, that there is special\nreference to such an object in the constitution of the intellectual faculties. There\nis a sphere of thought which comprehends things only as coexistent parts of a\nuniverse; but there is also a sphere of thought (Chap. xi.) in which they are\napprehended as links of an unbroken, and, to human appearance, an endless\nchain\u2014as having their place in an order connecting them both with that which\nhas gone before, and with that which shall follow after. In the contemplation of\nsuch a series, it is impossible not to feel the pre-eminence which is due, above\nall other relations, to the relation of cause and effect.\nHere I propose to consider, in their abstract form, some problems in which\nthe above relation is involved. There exists among such problems, as might\nbe anticipated from the nature of the relation with which they are concerned,\na wide diversity. From the probabilities of causes assigned `a priori, or given\nby experience, and their respective probabilities of association with an effect\ncontemplated, it may be required to determine the probability of that effect;\nand this either, 1st, absolutely, or 2ndly, under given conditions. To such an\nobject some of the earlier of the following problems relate. On the other hand,\nit may be required to determine the probability of a particular cause, or of some\nparticular connexion among a system of causes, from observed effects, and the\nknown tendencies of the said causes, singly or in connexion, to the production of\nsuch effects. This class of questions will be considered in a subsequent portion\nof the chapter, and other forms of the general inquiry will also be noticed. I\nwould remark, that although these examples are designed chiefly as illustrations\nof a method, no regard has been paid to the question of ease or convenience in\nthe application of that method. On the contrary, they have been devised, with\nwhatever success, as types of the class of problems which might be expected to\narise from the study of the relation of cause and effect in the more complex of\nits actual and visible manifestations.\n248\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 249\n2. Problem I.\u2014The probabilities of two causes A1 and A2 are c1 and c2\nrespectively. The probability that if the cause A1 present itself, an event E\nwill accompany it (whether as a consequence of the cause A1 or not) is p1, and\nthe probability that if the cause A2 present itself, that event E will accompany\nit, whether as a consequence of it or not, is p2. Moreover, the event E cannot\nappear in the absence of both the causes A1 and A2. 1 Required the probability\nof the event E.\nThe solution of what this problem becomes in the case in which the causes\nA1, A2 are mutually exclusive, is well known to be\nProb. E = c1p1 + c2p2;\nand it expresses a particular case of a fundamental and very important principle\nin the received theory of probabilities. Here it is proposed to solve the problem\nfree from the restriction above stated.\nLet us represent\nThe cause A1 by x.\nThe cause A2 by y.\nThe effect E by z.\nThen we have the following numerical data:\nProb. x = c1, Prob. y = c2,\nProb. xz = c1p1, Prob. yz = c2p2. (1)\nAgain, it is provided that if the causes A1, A2 are both absent, the effect E does\nnot occur; whence we have the logical equation\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = v(1 \u2212 z).\nOr, eliminating v,\nz(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (2)\nNow assume,\nxz = s, yz = t. (3)\n1The mode in which such data as the above might be furnished by experience is easily\nconceivable. Opposite the window of the room in which I write is a field, liable to be overflowed\nfrom two causes, distinct, but capable of being combined, viz., floods from the upper sources\nof the River Lee, and tides from the ocean. Suppose that observations made on N separate\noccasions have yielded the following results: On A occasions the river was swollen by freshets,\nand on P of those occasions it was inundated, whether from this cause or not. On B occasions\nthe river was swollen by the tide, and on Q of those occasions it was inundated, whether from\nthis cause or not. Supposing, then, that the field cannot be inundated in the absence of\nboth the causes above mentioned, let it be required to determine the total probability of its\ninundation.\nHere the elements a, b, p, q of the general problem represent the ratios\nA\nN , P\nA , B\nN , Q\nB ,\nor rather the values to which those ratios approach, as the value of N is indefinitely increased.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 250\nThen, reducing these equations (VIII. 7), and connecting the result with (2),\nxz(1 \u2212 s) + s(1 \u2212 xz) + yz(1 \u2212 t) + t(1 \u2212 yz) + z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 0.

(9)\nEquating the values of V 3 in (8) and (9), we have\n(u \u2212 c1p1)(u \u2212 c2p2)(1 \u2212 u)\n= {1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1) \u2212 u)}{1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2) \u2212 u}(c1p1 + c2p2 \u2212 u),\nwhich may be more conveniently written in the form\n(u \u2212 c1p1)(u \u2212 c2p2)\nc1p1 + c2p2 \u2212 u = {1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1) \u2212 u}{1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2) \u2212 u}\n1 \u2212 u . (10)\nFrom this equation the value of u may be found. It remains only to determine\nwhich of the roots must be taken for this purpose.\n3. It has been shown (XIX. 12) that the quantity u, in order that it may\nrepresent the probability required in the above case, must exceed each of the\nquantities c1p1, c2p2, and fall short of each of the quantities 1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1),\n1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2) and c1p1 + c2p2; the condition among the constants, moreover,\nbeing that the three last quantities must individually exceed each of the two\nformer ones. Now I shall show that these conditions being satisfied, the final\nequation (10) has but one root which falls within the limits assigned. That root\nwill therefore be the required value of u.\nLet us represent the lower limits c1p1, c2p2, by a, b respectively, and the\nupper limits 1\u2212c1(1\u2212p1), 1\u2212c2(1\u2212p2) and c1p1 +c2p2 by a\u2032, b\u2032, c\u2032 respectively.\nThen the general equation may be expressed in the form\n(u \u2212 a)(u \u2212 b)(1 \u2212 u) \u2212 (a\u2032 \u2212 u)(b\u2032 \u2212 u)(c\u2032 \u2212 u) = 0, (11)\nor(1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032)u2 \u2212 {ab \u2212 a\u2032b\u2032 + (1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032)c\u2032}u + ab \u2212 a\u2032b\u2032c\u2032 = 0.\nRepresenting the first member of the above equation by V , we have\nd2V\ndu2 = 2(1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032). (12)\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 252\nNow let us suppose a the highest of the lower limits of u, a\u2032 the lowest of its\nhigher limits, and trace the progress of the values of V between the limits u = a\nand u = a\u2032.\nWhen u = a, we see from the form of the first member of (11) that V is\nnegative, and when u = a\u2032 we see that V is positive. Between those limits V\nvaries continuously without becoming infinite, and d2V\ndu2 is always of the same\nsign.\nHence if u represent the abscissa V the ordinate of a plane curve, it is\nevident that the curve will pass from a point below the axis of u corresponding\nto u = a, to a point above the axis of u corresponding to u = a\u2032, the curve\nremaining continuous, and having its concavity or convexity always turned in\nthe same direction. A little attention will show that, under these circumstances,\nit must cut the axis of u once, and only once.\nHence between the limits u = a, u = a\u2032, there exists one value of u, and only\none, which satisfies the equation (11). It will further appear, if in thought the\ncurve be traced, that the other value of u will be less than a when the quantity\n1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032 is positive and greater than any one of the quantities a\u2032, b\u2032, c\u2032 when\n1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032 is negative. It hence follows that in the solution of (11) the positive\nsign of the radical must be taken. We thus find\nu = ab \u2212 a\u2032b\u2032 + (1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032)c\u2032 + \u221aQ\n2(1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032) , (13)\nwhere Q = {ab \u2212 a\u2032b\u2032 + (1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032)c\u2032}2 \u2212 4(1 \u2212 a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032)(ab \u2212 a\u2032b\u2032c\u2032).\n4. The results of this investigation may to some extent be verified. Thus,\nit is evident that the probability of the event E must in general exceed the\nprobability of the concurrence of the event E and the cause A1 or A2. Hence\nwe must have, as the solution indicates,\nu > c1p1, u > c2p2.\nAgain, it is clear that the probability of the effect E must in general be less\nthan it would be if the causes A1, A2 were mutually exclusive. Hence\nu =\n< c1p1 + c2p2.\nLastly, since the probability of the failure of the effect E concurring with the\npresence of the cause A1 must, in general, be less than the absolute probability\nof the failure of E, we have\nc1(1 \u2212 p1) =\n< 1 \u2212 u,\n\u2234 u =\n< 1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1).\nSimilarly,\nu =\n< 1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2).\nAnd thus the conditions by which the general solution was limited are\nconfirmed.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 253\nAgain, let p1 = 1, p2 = 1. This is to suppose that when either of the causes\nA1, A2 is present, the event E will occur. We have then a = c1, b = c2, a\u2032 = 1,\nb\u2032 = 1, c\u2032 = c1 + c2, and substituting in (13) we get\nu = c1c2 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 \u2212 1 + \u221a{(c1c2 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2 \u2212 1)2 + 4(c1c2 \u2212 c1 \u2212 c2)}\n\u22122\n= c1 + c2 \u2212 c1c2 on reduction\n= 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 c1)(1 \u2212 c2).\nNow this is the known expression for the probability that one cause at least will\nbe present, which, under the circumstances, is evidently the probability of the\nevent E.\nFinally, let it be supposed that c1 and c2 are very small, so that their product\nmay be neglected; then the expression for u reduces to c1p1 + c2p2. Now the\nsmaller the probability of each cause, the smaller, in a much higher degree, is\nthe probability of a conjunction of causes. Ultimately, therefore, such reduction\ncontinuing, the probability of the event E becomes the same as if the causes\nwere mutually exclusive.\nI have dwelt at greater length upon this solution, because it serves in some\nrespect as a model for those which follow, some of which, being of a more\ncomplex character, might, without such preparation, appear difficult.\n5. Problem II.\u2014In place of the supposition adopted in the previous\nproblem, that the event E cannot happen when both the causes A1, A2 are\nabsent, let it be assumed that the causes A1, A2 cannot both be absent, and\nlet the other circumstances remain as before. Required, then, the probability\nof the event E.\nHere, in place of the equation (2) of the previous solution, we have the\nequation\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 0.\nThe developed logical expression of z is found to be\nz = stxy + 1\n0 stx\u00afy + 1\n0 st\u00afxy + 1\n0 st\u00afx\u00afy\n+ 1\n0 s\u00aftxy + s\u00aftx\u00afy + 1\n0 s\u00aft\u00afxy + 1\n0 s\u00aft\u00afx\u00afy\n+ 1\n0 \u00afstxy + 1\n0 \u00afstx\u00afy + \u00afst\u00afxy + 1\n0 \u00afst\u00afx\u00afy\n+ 0\u00afs\u00aftxy + 0\u00afs\u00aftx\u00afy + 0\u00afs\u00aft\u00afxy + 1\n0 \u00afs\u00aft\u00afx\u00afy;\nand the final solution is\nProb.

PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 254\nwherein a = c1p1, b = c2p2, a\u2032 = 1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1), b\u2032 = 1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2).\nThe conditions of limitation are the following:\u2014That value of u must be\nchosen which exceeds each of the three quantities\na, b, and a\u2032 + b\u2032 \u2212 1,\nand which at the same time falls short of each of the three quantities\na\u2032, b\u2032, and a + b.\nExactly as in the solution of the previous problem, it may be shown that the\nquadratic equation (1) will have one root, and only one root, satisfying these\nconditions. The conditions themselves were deduced by the same rule as before,\nexcepting that the minor limit a\u2032 + b\u2032 \u2212 1 was found by seeking the major limit\nof 1 \u2212 z.\nIt may be added that the constants in the data, beside satisfying the\nconditions implied above, viz., that the quantities a\u2032, b\u2032, and a + b, must\nindividually exceed a, b, and a\u2032 + b\u2032 \u2212 1, must also satisfy the condition\nc1 + c2\n=\n> 1. This also appears from the application of the rule.\n6. Problem III.\u2014The probabilities of two events A and B are a and b\nrespectively, the probability that if the event A take place an event E will\naccompany it is p, and the probability that if the event B take place, the same\nevent E will accompany it is q.

(8)\nNow from (6) and (8) we get\n\u03bc = h\u2032(u \u2212 m) + l\nm , \u03bd = h(u \u2212 m) \u2212 l\nm .\nSubstitute these values in (7) reduced to the form\n\u03bc(\u03bd + h) = abpq,\nand we have\n(hu \u2212 l){h\u2032(u \u2212 m) + l} = abpqm2, (9)\na quadratic equation, the solution of which determines u, the value of Prob. xy\nsought.\nThe solution may readily be put in the form\nh = lh\u2032 + h(h\u2032m \u2212 l) \u00b1 \u221a[{lh\u2032 \u2212 h(h\u2032m \u2212 l)}2 + 4hh\u2032abpqm2]\n2hh\u2032 .\nBut if we further observe that\nlh\u2032 \u2212 h(h\u2032m \u2212 l) = l(h + h\u2032) \u2212 hh\u2032m = (1 \u2212 hh\u2032)m,\nsince\nh = ap + bq \u2212 1, h\u2032 = a(1 \u2212 p) + b(1 \u2212 q) \u2212 1,\nwhence\nh + h\u2032 = a + b \u2212 2 = m,\nwe find\nProb. xy = lh\u2032 + h(h\u2032m \u2212 l) \u00b1 m\u221a{(l \u2212 hh\u2032)2 + 4hh\u2032abpq}\n2hh\u2032 . (10)\nIt remains to determine which sign must be given to the radical. We might\nascertain this by the general method exemplified in the last problem, but it is\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 258\nfar easier, and it fully suffices in the present instance, to determine the sign\nby a comparison of the above formula with the result proper to some known\ncase. For instance, if it were certain that the event A is always, and the event\nB never, associated with the event E, then it is certain that the events A and\nB are never conjoined. Hence if p = 1, q = 0, we ought to have u = 0. Now the\nassumptions p = 1, q = 0, give\nh = a \u2212 1, h\u2032 = b \u2212 1, l = 0, m = a + b \u2212 2.\nSubstituting in (10) we have\nProb. xy = (a \u2212 1)(b \u2212 1)(a + b \u2212 2) \u00b1 (a + b \u2212 2)(a \u2212 1)(b \u2212 1)\n2(a \u2212 1)(b \u2212 1) ,\nand3 this expression vanishes when the lower sign is taken. Hence the final\nsolution of the general problem will be expressed in the form\nProb. xy\nProb. x = lh\u2032 + h(h\u2032m \u2212 l) \u2212 m\u221a{(l \u2212 hh\u2032)2 + 4hh\u2032abpq}\n2ahh\u2032 ,\nwherein h = ap + bq \u2212 1, h\u2032 = a(1 \u2212 p) + b(1 \u2212 q) \u2212 1,\nl = ab(p + q \u2212 1), m = a + b \u2212 2.\nAs the terms in the final logical solution affected by the coefficient 1\n0 are the\nsame as in the first problem of this chapter, the conditions among the constants\nwill be the same, viz.,\nap =\n< 1 \u2212 b(1 \u2212 q), bq =\n< 1 \u2212 a(1 \u2212 p).\n7. It is a confirmation of the correctness of the above solution that the expression\nobtained is symmetrical with respect to the two sets of quantities p, q, and 1\u2212p,\n1 \u2212 q, i.e. that on changing p into 1 \u2212 p, and q into 1 \u2212 q, the expression is\nunaltered This is apparent from the equation\nProb. xy = ab\n\u001a pq\n\u03bc + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)\n\u03bd\n\u001b\nemployed in deducing the final result. Now if there exist probabilities p, q of the\nevent E, as consequent upon a knowledge of the occurrences of A and B, there\nexist probabilities 1\u2212p, 1\u2212q of the contrary event, that is, of the non-occurrence\nof E under the same circumstances. As then the data are unchanged in form,\nwhether we take account in them of the occurrence or of the non-occurrence of\nE, it is evident that the solution ought to be, as it is, a symmetrical function of\np, q and 1 \u2212 p, 1 \u2212 q.\n3The numerator was originally \u201c(a \u2212 1)b \u2212 1)(a + b \u2212 2) . . . \u201d, and was fixed in 2004 by\nDistributed Proofreaders.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 259\nLet us examine the particular case in which p = 1, q = 1. We find\nh = a + b \u2212 1, h\u2032 = \u22121, l = ab, m = a + b \u2212 2,\nand substituting\nProb. xy\nProb. x = \u2212ab + (a + b \u2212 1)(2 \u2212 a \u2212 b \u2212 ab) \u2212 (a + b \u2212 2)(ab \u2212 a \u2212 b + 1)\n\u22122a(a + b \u2212 1)\n= \u22122ab(a + b \u2212 1)\n\u22122a(a + b \u2212 1) = b.\nIt would appear, then, that in this case the events A and B are virtually\nindependent of each other. The supposition of their invariable association\nwith some other event E, of the frequency of whose occurrence, except as it\nmay be inferred from this particular connexion, absolutely nothing is known,\ndoes not establish any dependence between the events A and B themselves.\nI apprehend that this conclusion is agreeable to reason, though particular\nexamples may appear at first sight to indicate a different result. For instance,\nif the probabilities of the casting up, 1st, of a particular species of weed, 2ndly,\nof a certain description of zoophytes upon the sea-shore, had been separately\ndetermined, and if it had also been ascertained that neither of these events could\nhappen except during the agitation of the waves caused by a tempest, it would,\nI think, justly be concluded that the events in question were not independent.\nThe picking up of a piece of seaweed of the kind supposed would, it is presumed,\nrender more probable the discovery of the zoophytes than it would otherwise\nhave been. But I apprehend that this fact is due to our knowledge of another\ncircumstance not implied in the actual conditions of the problem, viz., that\nthe occurrence of a tempest is but an occasional phenomenon. Let the range\nof observation be confined to a sea always vexed with storm. It would then, I\nsuppose, be seen that the casting up of the weeds and of the zoophytes ought\nto be regarded as independent events. Now, to speak more generally, there\nare conditions common to all ph\u00e6nomena,\u2014conditions which, it is felt, do\nnot affect their mutual independence. I apprehend therefore that the solution\nindicates, that when a particular condition has prevailed through the whole of\nour recorded experience, it assumes the above character with reference to the\nclass of ph\u00e6nomena over which that experience has extended.\n8. Problem IV.\u2014To illustrate in some degree the above observations,\nlet there be given, in addition to the data of the last problem, the absolute\nprobability of the event E, the completed system of data being\nProb. x = a, Prob. y = b, Prob. z = c,\nProb. xz = ap, Prob. yz = bq,\nand let it be required to find Prob. xy.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 260\nAssuming, as before, xz = s, yz = t, xy = w, the final logical equation is\nw = xystz + xy\u00afs\u00aft\u00afz + 0(x\u00afys\u00aftz + \u00afxy\u00afstz + x\u00afy\u00afz\u00afs\u00aft + xy\u00afz\u00afs\u00aft\n+\u00afx\u00afyz\u00afs\u00aft + \u00afx\u00afy\u00afz\u00afs\u00aft)\n+ terms whose coefficients are 1\n0 .\nThe algebraic system having been formed, the subsequent eliminations may be\nsimplified by the transformations adopted in the previous problem. The final\nresult is\nProb. xy = ab\n\u001a pq\nc + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)\n1 \u2212 c\n\u001b\n. (2)\nThe conditions among the constants are\nc =\n> ap, c =\n> bq, c =\n< 1 \u2212 a(1 \u2212 p), c =\n< 1 \u2212 b(1 \u2212 q).\nNow if p = 1, q = 1, we find\nProb. xy = ab\nc ,\nc not admitting of any value less than a or b. It follows hence that if the event\nE is known to be an occasional one, its invariable attendance on the events x\nand y increases the probability of their conjunction in the inverse ratio of its\nown frequency. The formula (2) may be verified in a large number of cases. As\na particular instance, let q = c, we find\nProb. xy = ab. (3)\nNow the assumption q = c involves, by Definition (Chap. XVI.) the independence\nof the events B and E. If then B and E are independent, no relation which may\nexist between A and E can establish a relation between A and B; wherefore A\nand B are also independent, as the above equation (3) implies.\nIt may readily be shown from (2) that the value of Prob. z, which renders\nProb. xy a minimum, is\nProb. z =\n\u221a(pq)\n\u221a(pq) + \u221a(1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q) .\nIf p = q, this gives\nProb. z = p;\na result, the correctness of which may be shown by the same considerations\nwhich have been applied to (3).\nProblem V.\u2014Given the probabilities of any three events, and the probability\nof their conjunction; required the probability of the conjunction of any two of\nthem.\nSuppose the data to be\nProb. x = p, Prob. y = q, Prob. z = r, Prob. xyz = m,\nCHAPTER XX.

H = \u00afp\u00afq + (p + q)\u00afr.\nThis admits of verification when p = 1, when q = 1, when r = 0, and therefore\nm = 0, &c.\nHad the condition, Prob. z = r, been omitted, the solution would still have\nbeen definite. We should have had\nProb. xy = pq(1 \u2212 m) + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 q)m\n1 \u2212 m ;\nand it may be added, as a final confirmation of their correctness, that the above\nresults become identical when m = pqr.\n9. The following problem is a generalization of Problem I., and its solution,\nthough necessarily more complex, is obtained by a similar analysis.\nProblem VI.\u2014If an event can only happen as a consequence of one or more\nof certain causes A1, A2, . . .

However, it is upon the former of these grounds alone that\nI desire to rest my apology.\n\u201cWhile hoping that some may be found who, without departing from the line of their\nprevious studies, may deem this question worthy of their attention, I wholly disclaim the\nnotion of its being offered as a trial of personal skill or knowledge, but desire that it may be\nviewed solely with reference to those public and scientific ends for the sake of which alone it\nis proposed.\u201d\nThe author thinks it right to add, that the publication of the above problem led to some\ninteresting private correspondence, but did not elicit a solution.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 262\nFurther, the condition that E can only happen in connexion with some one or\nmore of the causes A1, A2, . . . An establishes the logical condition,\nz(1 \u2212 x1)(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn) = 0. (1)\nNow let us assume generally\nxiz = ti,\nwhich is reducible to the form\nxiz(1 \u2212 ti) + ti(1 \u2212 xiz) = 0,\nforming the type of a system of n equations which, together with (1), express\nthe logical conditions of the problem. Adding all these equations together, as\nafter the previous reduction we are permitted to do, we have\nX{xiz(1 \u2212 ti) + ti(1 \u2212 xiz)} + z(1 \u2212 x1)(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn) = 0, (2)\n(the summation implied by P extending from i = 1 to i = n), and this single\nand sufficient logical equation, together with the 2n data, represented by the\ngeneral equations\nProb. xi = ci, Prob. ti = cipi, (3)\nconstitute the elements from which we are to determine Prob. z.\nLet (2) be developed with respect to z. We have\nhX{xi(1 \u2212 ti) + ti(1 \u2212 xi)} + (1 \u2212 x1)(1 \u2212 x2) . . .

(4)\nNow any constituent in the expansion of the second member of the above\nequation will consist of 2n factors, of which n are taken out of the set\nx1, x2, . . . xn, 1 \u2212 x1, 1 \u2212 x2, . . . 1 \u2212 xn, and n out of the set t1, t2, . . . tn, 1 \u2212 t1, 1 \u2212\nt2 . . . 1 \u2212 tn, no such combination as x1(1 \u2212 x1), t1(1 \u2212 t1), being admissible. Let\nus consider first those constituents of which (1 \u2212 t1), (1 \u2212 t2) . . . (1 \u2212 tn) forms\nthe t-factor, that is the factor derived from the set t1, . . . 1 \u2212 t1.\nThe coefficient of any such constituent will be found by changing t1, t2, . . . tn\nrespectively into 0 in the second member of (4), and then assigning to\nx1, x2, . . . xn their values as dependent upon the nature of the x-factor of\nthe constituent. Now simply substituting for t1, t2, . . . tn the value 0, the second\nmember becomes\n0\n\u2212 P xi \u2212 (1 \u2212 x1)(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn) ,\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 263\nand this vanishes whatever values, 0, 1, we subsequently assign to x1, x2, . . . xn.\nFor if those values are not all equal to 0, the term P xi does not vanish, and\nif they are all equal to 0, the term \u2212(1 \u2212 x1) . . . (1 \u2212 xn) becomes \u22121, so that\nin either case the denominator does not vanish, and therefore the fraction does.\nHence the coefficients of all constituents of which (1 \u2212 t1) . . . (1 \u2212 tn) is a factor\nwill be 0, and as the sum of all possible x-constituents is unity, there will be an\naggregate term 0(1 \u2212 t1) . . . (1 \u2212 tn) in the development of z.\nConsider, in the next place, any constituent of which the t-factor is\nt1 t2 . . . tr (1 \u2212 tr+1) . . . (1 \u2212 tn), r being equal to or greater than unity. Making\nin the second member of (4), t1 = 1, . . . tr = 1, tr+1 = 0, . . . tn = 0, we get the\nexpression\nr\nx1 . . . + xr \u2212 xr+1 . . . \u2212 xn \u2212 (1 \u2212 x1)(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn)\nNow the only admissible values of the symbols being 0 and 1, it is evident\nthat the above expression will be equal to 1 when x1 = 1 . . . xr = 1, xr+1 =\n0, . . . xn = 0, and that for all other combinations of value that expression will\nassume a value greater than unity. Hence the coefficient 1 will be applied to all\nconstituents of the final development which are of the form\nx1 . . . xr (1 \u2212 xr+1) . . . (1 \u2212 xn) t1 . . . tr (1 \u2212 tr+1) . . . (1 \u2212 tn),\nthe x-factor being similar to the t-factor, while other constituents included under\nthe present case will have the virtual coefficient 1\n0 . Also, it is manifest that this\nreasoning is independent of the particular arrangement and succession of the\nindividual symbols.\nHence the complete expansion of z will be of the form\nz = X(XT ) + 0(1 \u2212 t1)(1 \u2212 t2) . . . (1 \u2212 tn)\n+ constituents whose coefficients are 1\n0 , (5)\nwhere T represents any t-constituent except (1 \u2212 t1) . . . (1 \u2212 tn), and X the\ncorresponding or similar constituent of x1 . . . xn. For instance, if n = 2, we shall\nhave X(XT ) = x1x2t1t2 + x1 \u00afx2t1\u00aft2 + \u00afx1x2\u00aft1t2,\n\u00afx1, \u00afx2, &c. standing for 1 \u2212 x1, 1 \u2212 x2, &c.; whence\nz = x1x2t1t2 + x1 \u00afx2t1\u00aft2 + \u00afx1x2\u00aft1t2\n+0(x1x2\u00aft1\u00aft2 + x1 \u00afx2\u00aft1\u00aft2 + \u00afx1x2\u00aft1\u00aft2 + \u00afx1 \u00afx2\u00aft1\u00aft2)\n+ constituents whose coefficients are 1\n0 .\n(6)\nThis result agrees, difference of notation being allowed for, with the developed\nform of z in Problem I. of this chapter, as it evidently ought to do.\nCHAPTER XX.

(\u03bc \u2212 an)\n\u03bcn\u22121 , (14)\nwherein\n\u03bc = u + (b1 \u2212 u) . . . (bn \u2212 u)\n(1 \u2212 u)n\u22121 . (15)\nThis value of \u03bc substituted in (14) will give an equation involving only u, the\nsolution of which will determine Prob. z, since by (13) Prob. z = u. It remains\nto assign the limits of u.\n11. Now the very same analysis by which the limits were determined in the\nparticular case in which n = 2, (XIX. 12) conducts us in the present case to\nthe following result. The quantity u, in order that it may represent the value\nof Prob. z, must must have for its inferior limits the quantities a1, a2, . . . an,\nand for its superior limits the quantities b1, b2, . . . bn, a1 + a2 . . . + an. We may\nhence infer, `a priori, that there will always exist one root, and only one root, of\nthe equation (14) satisfying these conditions. I deem it sufficient, for practical\nverification, to show that there will exist one, and only one, root of the equation\n(14), between the limits a1, a2, . . . an, and b1, b2, . . . bn.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 267\nFirst, let us consider the nature of the changes to which \u03bc is subject in (15),\nas u varies from a1, which we will suppose the greatest of its minor limits, to b1,\nwhich we will suppose the least of its major limits. When u = a1 it is evident\nthat \u03bc is positive and greater than a1. When u = b1, we have \u03bc = b1, which\nis also positive. Between the limits u = a1, u = b1 it may be shown that \u03bc\nincreases with u. Thus we have\nd\u03bc\ndu = 1 \u2212 (b2 \u2212 u) . . . (bn \u2212 u)\n(1 \u2212 u)n\u22121 \u2212 (b1 \u2212 u)(b3 \u2212 u) . . . (bn \u2212 u)\n(1 \u2212 u)n\u22121 . . .\n+(n \u2212 1) (b1 \u2212 u)(b2 \u2212 u) . . . (bn \u2212 u)\n(1 \u2212 u)n .\n(16)\nNow let b1 \u2212 u\n1 \u2212 u = x1 . . . bn \u2212 u\n1 \u2212 u = xn.\nEvidently x1, x2, . . . xn, will be proper fractions, and we have\nd\u03bc\ndu = 1 \u2212 x2x3 . . . xn \u2212 x1x3 . . . xn . . . \u2212 x1x2 . . . xn\u22121 + (n \u2212 1)x1x2 . . . xn\n= 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x1)x2x3 . . . xn \u2212 x1(1 \u2212 x2)x3 . . . xn . . .\n\u2212x1x2 . . . xn\u22121(1 \u2212 xn) \u2212 x1x2 . . . xn.\nNow the negative terms in the second member are (if we may borrow the\nlanguage of the logical developments) constituents formed from the fractional\nquantities x1, x2, . . . xn. Their sum cannot therefore exceed unity; whence d\u03bc\ndu\nis positive, and \u03bc increases with u between the limits specified.\nNow let (14) be written in the form\n(\u03bc \u2212 a1) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 an)\n\u03bcn\u22121 \u2212 (\u03bc \u2212 u) = 0, (17)\nand assume u = a1. The first member becomes\n(\u03bc \u2212 a1)\n\u001a (\u03bc \u2212 a2) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 an)\n\u03bcn\u22121 \u2212 1\n\u001b\n, (18)\nand this expression is negative in value. For, making the same assumption in\n(15), we find\n\u03bc \u2212 a1 = (b1 \u2212 u) . . . (bn \u2212 u)\n(1 \u2212 u)n\u22121 = a positive quantity.\nAt the same time we have\n(\u03bc \u2212 a2) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 an)\n\u03bcn\u22121 = \u03bc \u2212 a2\n\u03bc . . . \u03bc \u2212 an\n\u03bc ,\nand since the factors of the second member are positive fractions, that member\nis less than unity, whence (18) is negative. Wherefore the assumption u = a1\nmakes the first member of (17) negative.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 268\nSecondly, let u = b1, then by (15) \u03bc = u = b1, and the first member of (17)\nbecomes positive.\nLastly, between the limits u = a1 and u = b1 the first member of (17)\ncontinuously increases. For the first term of that expression written under the\nform\n(\u03bc \u2212 a1) \u03bc \u2212 a1\n\u03bc . . . \u03bc \u2212 an\n\u03bc\nincreases, since \u03bc increases, and, with it, every factor contained. Again, the\nnegative term \u03bc \u2212 u diminishes with the increase of u, as appears from its value\ndeduced from (15), viz.,\n(b1 \u2212 u) . . . (bn \u2212 u)\n(1 \u2212 u)n\u22121 .\nHence then, between the limits u = a1, u = b1, the first member of (17)\ncontinuously increases, changing in so doing from a negative to a positive value.\nWherefore, between the limits assigned, there exists one value of u, and only\none, by which the said equation is satisfied.\n12. Collecting these results together, we arrive at the following solution of\nthe general problem.\nThe probability of the event E will be that value of u deduced from the\nequation\n\u03bc \u2212 u = (\u03bc \u2212 c1p1) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 cnpn)\n\u03bcn\u22121 , (19)\nwherein\n\u03bc = u + {1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1) \u2212 u} . . . {1 \u2212 cn(1 \u2212 pn) \u2212 u}\n(1 \u2212 u)n\u22121 ,\nwhich (value) lies between the two sets of quantities,\nc1p1, c2p2, . . . , cnpn and 1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1), 1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2) . . . 1 \u2212 cn(1 \u2212 pn),\nthe former set being its inferior, the latter its superior, limits.\nAnd it may further be inferred in the general case, as it has been proved in\nthe particular case of n = 2, that the value of u, determined as above, will not\nexceed the quantity\nc1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn.\n13. Particular verifications are subjoined.\n1st. Let p1 = 1, p2 = 1, . . . pn = 1. This is to suppose it certain, that if any\none of the events A1, A2 . . . An happen, the event E will happen. In this case,\nthen, the probability of the occurrence of E will simply be the probability that\nthe events or causes A1, A2 . . . An do not all fail of occurring, and its expression\nwill therefore be 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 c1)(1 \u2212 c2) . . . (1 \u2212 cn).\nNow the general solution (19) gives\n\u03bc \u2212 u = (\u03bc \u2212 c1) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 cn)\n\u03bcn\u22121 ,\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 269\nwherein\n\u03bc = u + (1 \u2212 u)n\n(1 \u2212 u)n\u22121 = 1.\nHence,\n1 \u2212 u = (1 \u2212 c1) . . . (1 \u2212 cn),\n\u2234 u = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 c1) . . . (1 \u2212 cn),\nequivalent to the `a priori determination above.\n2nd. Let p1 = 0, p2 = 0, pn = 0, then (19) gives\n\u03bc \u2212 u = \u03bc,\n\u2234 u = 0,\nas it evidently ought to be.\n3rd. Let c1, c2 . . . cn be small quantities, so that their squares and products\nmay be neglected. Then developing the second members of the equation (19),\n\u03bc \u2212 u = \u03bcn \u2212 (c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn)\u03bcn\u22121\n\u03bcn\u22121\n= \u03bc \u2212 (c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn),\n\u2234 u = c1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn.\nNow this is what the solution would be were the causes A1, A2 . . . An\nmutually exclusive. But the smaller the probabilities of those causes, the\nmore do they approach the condition of being mutually exclusive, since the\nsmaller is the probability of any concurrence among them. Hence the result\nabove obtained will undoubtedly be the limiting form of the expression for the\nprobability of E.\n4th. In the particular case of n = 2, we may readily eliminate \u03bc from the\ngeneral solution. The result is\n(u \u2212 c1p1)(u \u2212 c2p2)\nc1p1 + c2p2 \u2212 u = {1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1) \u2212 u}{1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2) \u2212 u}\n1 \u2212 u ,\nwhich agrees with the particular solution before obtained for this case, Problem\ni.\nThough by the system (19), the solution is in general made to depend upon\nthe solution of an equation of a high order, its practical difficulty will not be\ngreat. For the conditions relating to the limits enable us to select at once a near\nvalue of u, and the forms of the system (19) are suitable for the processes of\nsuccessive approximation.\n14. Problem 7.\u2014The data being the same as in the last problem, required\nthe probability, that if any definite and given combination of the causes\nA1, A2, . . . An, present itself, the event E will be realized.\nThe cases A1, A2, . . . An, being represented as before by x1, x2, . . . xn\nrespectively, let the definite combination of them, referred to in the statement of\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 270\nthe problem, be represented by the \u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn) so that the actual occurrence\nof that combination will be expressed by the logical equation,\n\u03d5(x1, x2, . . . xn) = 1.\nThe data are\nProb. x1 = c1, . . . Prob. xn = cn,\nProb. x1z = c1p1, Prob. xnz = cnpn; (1)\nand the object of investigation is\nProb. \u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn)z\nProb. \u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn) . (2)\nWe shall first seek the value of the numerator.\nLet us assume,\nx1z = t1 . . . xnz = tn, (3)\n\u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn)z = w. (4)\nOr, if for simplicity, we represent \u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn) by \u03d5, the last equation will be\n\u03d5z = w, (5)\nto which must be added the equation\n\u00afx1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxnz = 0. (6)\nNow any equation xr z = tr of the system (3) may be reduced to the form\nxr z\u00aftr + tr (1 \u2212 xr z) = 0.\nSimilarly reducing (5), and adding the different results together, we obtain the\nlogical equation\n\u03a3{xr z\u00aftr + tr (1 \u2212 xr z)} + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxnz + \u03d5z \u00afw + w(1 \u2212 \u03d5z) = 0, (7)\nfrom which z being eliminated, w must be determined as a developed logical\nfunction of x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tn.\nNow making successively z = 1, z = 0 in the above equation, and multiplying\nthe results together, we have\n{\u03a3(xr \u00aftr + \u00afxr tr ) + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn + \u03d5 \u00afw + w \u00af\u03d5} \u00d7 (\u03a3tr + w) = 0.\nDeveloping this equation with reference to w, and replacing in the result P tr +1\nby 1, in accordance with Prop. i. Chap. ix., we have\nEw + E\u2032(1 \u2212 w) = 0;\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 271\nwherein\nE = \u03a3(xr \u00aftr + tr \u00afxr ) + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn + \u00af\u03d5,\nE\u2032 = \u03a3tr {\u03a3(xr \u00aftr + tr \u00afxr ) + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn + \u03d5}.\nAnd hence\nw = E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E . (8)\nThe second member of this equation we must now develop with respect to\nthe double series of symbols x1, x2, . . . xn, t1, t2, . . . tn. In effecting this object, it\nwill be most convenient to arrange the constituents of the resulting development\nin three distinct classes, and to determine the coefficients proper to those classes\nseparately.\nFirst, let us consider those constituents of which \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn is a factor. Making\nt1 = 0 . . . tn = 0, we find\nE\u2032 = 0, E = \u03a3xr + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn + \u00af\u03d5.\nIt is evident, that whatever values (0, 1) are given to the x-symbols, E does not\nvanish. Hence the coefficients of all constituents involving \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn are 0.\nConsider secondly, those constituents which do not involve the factor \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn,\nand which are symmetrical with reference to the two sets of symbols x1 . . . xn\nand t1 . . . tn. By symmetrical constituents is here meant those which would\nremain unchanged if x1 were converted into t1, x2 into t2, &c., and vice vers\u02c6a.\nThe constituents x1 . . . xn t1 . . . tn, \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn, &c., are in this sense\nsymmetrical. For all symmetrical constituents it is evident that\nX(xr \u00aftr + tr \u00afxr )\nvanishes. For those which do not involve \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn, it is further evident that\n\u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn also vanishes, whence\nE = \u00af\u03d5 E\u2032 = \u03a3tr (\u03d5),\nw =\nP tr (\u03d5)\nP tr (\u03d5) \u2212 \u00af\u03d5 .\nFor those constituents of which the x-factor is found in \u03d5 the second member\nof the above equation becomes 1; for those of which the x-factor is found in \u00af\u03d5\nit becomes 0. Hence the coefficients of symmetrical constituents not involving\n\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn, of which the x-factor is found in \u03d5 will be 1; of those of which the\nx-factor is not found in \u03d5 it will be 0.\nConsider lastly, those constituents which are unsymmetrical with reference\nto the two sets of symbols, and which at the same time do not involve \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn.\nHere it is evident, that neither E nor E\u2032 can vanish, whence the numerator\nof the fractional value of w in (8) must exceed the denominator. That value\ncannot therefore be represented by 1, 0, or 0\n0 . It must then, in the logical\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 272\ndevelopment, be represented by 1\n0 . Such then will be the coefficient of this class\nof constituents.\n15. Hence the final logical equation by which w is expressed as a developed\nlogical function of x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tn, will be of the form\nw = X\n1(XT ) + 0{X\n2(XT ) + \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn} + 1\n0 (sum of other con-\nstituents),\n(9)\nwherein P\n1(XT ) represents the sum of all symmetrical constituents of which the\nfactor X is found in \u03d5, and P\n2(XT ), the sum of all symmetrical constituents of\nwhich the factor X is not found in \u03d5,\u2014the constituent \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn, should\nit appear, being in either case rejected.\nPassing from Logic to Algebra, it may be observed, that here and in all\nsimilar instances, the function V , by the aid of which the algebraic system of\nequations for the determination of the values of x1, . . . xn, t1 . . . tn is formed, is\nindependent of the nature of any function \u03d5 involved, not in the expression of\nthe data, but in that of the qu\u00e6situm of the problem proposed. Thus we have\nin the present example,\nProb. w =\nP\n1(XT )\nV ,\nwherein V = X\n1(XT ) + X\n2(XT ) + t1 . . . \u00aftn\n= X(XT ) + \u00aft1 . . . tn. (10)\nHere P(XT ) represents the sum of all symmetrical constituents of the x and t\nsymbols, except the constituent \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn, \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn. This value of V is the same\nas that virtually employed in the solution of the preceding problem, and hence\nwe may avail ourselves of the results there obtained.\nIf then, as in the solution referred to, we assume\nx1t1\n\u00afx1\u00aft1\n= m1, xntn\n\u00afxn\u00aftn\n= mn, x1\n\u00afx1\n= n1, &c.,\nwe shall obtain a result which may be thus written:\nProb. w = M1\nM + N \u2212 1 , (11)\nM1 being formed by rejecting from the function \u03d5 the constituent x1 . . . \u00afxn, if\nit is there found, dividing the result by the same constituent \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn and then\nchanging x1\n\u00afx1 into m1, x2\n\u00afx2 into m2, and so on. The values of M and N are the\nsame as in the preceding problem. Reverting to these and to the corresponding\nvalues of m1, m2, &c., we find\nProb. w = M1(\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1),\nthe general values of mr , nr being\nmr = cr pr\n\u03bc \u2212 cr pr\n, nr = cr (1 \u2212 pr )\n\u03bc \u2212 cr (1 \u2212 pr ) ,\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 273\nand \u03bc and \u03bd being given by the solution of the system of equations,\n\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1 = (\u03bc \u2212 c1p1) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 cnpn)\n\u03bcn\u22121 = {\u03bd \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1)} . . . {\u03bd \u2212 cn(1 \u2212 pn)}\n\u03bdn\u22121 .\nThe above value of Prob. w will be the numerator of the fraction (2). It now\nremains to determine its denominator.\nFor this purpose assume\n\u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn) = v,\nor\n\u03d5 = v;\nwhence\n\u03d5\u00afv + v \u00af\u03d5 = 0.\nSubstituting the first member of this equation in (7) in place of the\ncorresponding form \u03d5z \u00afw + w(1 \u2212 \u03d5z) we obtain as the primary logical equation,\nX{xr z\u00aftr + tr (1 \u2212 xr z)} + \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxnz + \u03d5\u00afv + v \u00af\u03d5 = 0,\nwhence eliminating z, and reducing by Prop.

The expressions are indeed used in place\nof \u03d5 and 1 \u2212 \u03d5 to preserve symmetry.\nIt follows hence that P\n1(X) + P\n2(X) = 1, and that, as before, P\n1(XT ) +P\n2(XT ) = P(XT ). Hence V will have the same value as before, and we shall\nhave\nProb. v =\nP\n1(XT ) + \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftn\nP\n1(X)\nV ,\nOr transforming, as in the previous case,\nProb. v = M1 + N1\nM + N \u2212 1 , (13)\nwherein N1 is formed by dividing \u03d5 by \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn, and changing in the result\nx1\n\u00afx1 into n1, x2\n\u00afx2 into n2, &c.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 274\nNow the final solution of the problem proposed will be given by assigning\ntheir determined values to the terms of the fraction\nProb. \u03d5(x1, . . . xn)z\nProb. \u03d5(x1, . . . xn) , or Prob. w\nProb. v .\nHence, therefore, by (11) and (13) we have\nProb. sought = M1\nM1 + N1\nA very slight attention to the mode of formation of the functions M1 and N1\nwill show that the process may be greatly simplified. We may, indeed, exhibit\nthe solution of the general problem in the form of a rule, as follows:\nReject from the function \u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn) the constituent \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn if it is\ntherein contained, suppress in all the remaining constituents the factors \u00afx1, \u00afx2,\n&c., and change generally in the result xr into cr pr\n\u03bc\u2212cr pr . Call this result M1.\nAgain, replace in the function \u03d5(x1, x2 . . . xn) the constituent \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn if is\ntherein found, by unity; suppress in all the remaining constituents the factors\n\u00afx1, \u00afx2, &c., and change generally in the result xr into cr (1\u2212pr )\n\u03bd\u2212cr (1\u2212pr ) .\nThen the solution required will be expressed by the formula\nM1\nM1 + N1\n, (14)\n\u03bc and \u03bd being determined by the solution of the system of equations\n\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1 = (\u03bc \u2212 c1p1) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 cnpn)\n\u03bcn\u22121\n= {\u03bd \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1)} . . . {\u03bc \u2212 cn(1 \u2212 pn)}\n\u03bdn\u22121 . (15)\nIt may be added, that the limits of \u03bc and \u03bd are the same as in the previous\nproblem. This might be inferred from the general principle of continuity; but\nconditions of limitation, which are probably sufficient, may also be established\nby other considerations.\nThus from the demonstration of the general method in probabilities, Chap.\nXVII. Prop,iv., it appears that the quantities x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tn in the primary\nsystem of algebraic equations, must be positive proper fractions. Now\nxr\n1 \u2212 xr\n= nr = cr (1 \u2212 pr )\n\u03bd \u2212 cr (1 \u2212 pr ) .\nHence generally nr must be a positive quantity, and therefore we must have\n\u03bd =\n> cr (1 \u2212 pr ).\nIn like manner since we have\nxr tr\n(1 \u2212 xr )(1 \u2212 tr ) = mr = cr pr\n\u03bc \u2212 cr pr\n,\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 275\nwe must have generally\n\u03bc =\n> cr pr .\n16. It is probable that the two classes of conditions thus represented are\ntogether sufficient to determine generally which of the roots of the equations\ndetermining \u03bc and \u03bd are to be taken. Let us take in particular the case in which\nn = 2. Here we have\n\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1 = (\u03bc \u2212 c1p1)(\u03bc \u2212 c2 p2)\n\u03bc = \u03bc \u2212 (c1p1 + c2p2) + c1p1c2p2\n\u03bc ,\n\u2234 \u03bd = 1 \u2212 c1p1 \u2212 c2p2 + c1p1 c2p2\n\u03bc = 1 \u2212 c1p1 \u2212 (\u03bc \u2212 c1p1)c2p2\n\u03bc .\nWhence, since \u03bc =\n> c1p1 we have generally\n\u03bd =\n< 1 \u2212 c1p1.\nIn like manner we have\n\u03bd =\n< 1 \u2212 c2p2, \u03bc =\n< 1 \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1), \u03bc =\n< 1 \u2212 c2(1 \u2212 p2).\nNow it has already been shown that there will exist but one value of \u03bc\nsatisfying the whole of the above conditions relative to that quantity, viz.\n\u03bc =\n> cr pr , \u03bc =\n< 1 \u2212 cr (1 \u2212 pr ),\nwhence the solution for this case, at least, is determinate. And I apprehend that\nthe same method is generally applicable and sufficient. But this is a question\nupon which a further degree of light is desirable.\nTo verify the above results, suppose \u03d5(x1, . . . xn) = 1, which is virtually the\ncase considered in the previous problem. Now the development of 1 gives all\npossible constituents of the symbols x1, . . . xn. Proceeding then according to\nthe Rule, we find\nM1 = \u03bcn\n(\u03bc \u2212 c1p1) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 cnpn) \u2212 1 = \u03bc\n\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1 \u2212 1 by (15).\nN1 = \u03bdn\n{\u03bd \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1)} . . . {\u03bd \u2212 cn(1 \u2212 pn)} \u2212 1 = \u03bd\n\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1 \u2212 1.\nSubstituting in (14) we find\nProb. z = 1 \u2212 \u03bd,\nwhich agrees with the previous solution.\nAgain, let \u03d5(x1, . . . xn) = x1, which, after development and suppression of\nthe factors \u00afx2, . . . \u00afxn, gives x1(x2 + 1) . . . (xn + 1), whence we find\nM1 = c1p1\u03bcn\u22121\n(\u03bc \u2212 c1p1) . . . (\u03bc \u2212 cnpn) = c1p1\n\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1 by (15).\nN1 = c1(1 \u2212 p1)\u03bdn\u22121\n{\u03bd \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1)} . . . {\u03bd \u2212 cn(1 \u2212 pn)} = c1(1 \u2212 p1)\n\u03bc + \u03bd \u2212 1 .\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 276\nSubstituting, we have\nProbability that if the event A1, occur, E will occur = p1.\nAnd this result is verified by the data. Similar verifications might easily be\nadded.\nLet us examine the case in which\n\u03d5(x1, . . . xn) = x1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn + x2 \u00afx1 \u00afx3 . . . \u00afxn . . . + xn \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn\u22121.\nHere we find\nM1 = c1p1\n\u03bc \u2212 c1p1\n. . . + cnpn\n\u03bc \u2212 cnpn\n,\nN1 = c1(1 \u2212 p1)\n\u03bd \u2212 c1(1 \u2212 p1) . . . + cn(1 \u2212 pn)\n\u03bd \u2212 cn(1 \u2212 pn) ;\nwhence we have the following result\u2014\nProbability that if some one\nalone of the causes A1, A2 . . .

An is one of the\nelements of the data, expressing a condition under which the very observations\nby which the probabilities of A1, A2, &c. are supposed to have been determined,\nwere made.\nConsider, lastly, the case in which \u03d5(x1, . . . xn) = x1x2 . . . xn. Here\nM1 = c1p1 . . . cnpn\n(\u03bc \u2212 c1p1) . . .

An being so restricted that\nthey cannot all fail, but still can only occur in certain definite combinations\ndenoted by the equation\n\u03d5(A1, A2 . . . An) = 1,\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 277\nand there being given the separate probabilities c1, . . . cn of the said causes, and\nthe corresponding probabilities p1, . . . pn that an event E will follow if those\nrespective causes are realized, required the probability of the event E.\nThis problem differs from the one last considered in several particulars, but\nchiefly in this, that the restriction denoted by the equation \u03d5(A1, . . . An) = 1,\nforms one of the data, and is supposed to be furnished by or to be accordant\nwith the very experience from which the knowledge of the numerical elements\nof the problem is derived.\nRepresenting the events A1, . . . An by x1, . . . xn respectively, and the event\nE by z, we have\u2014\nProb. xr = cr , Prob. xr z = cr pr . (1)\nLet us assume, generally,\nxr z = tr ,\nthen combining the system of equations thus indicated with the equations\n\u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn = 0, \u03d5(x1, . . . xn) = 1, or \u03d5 = 1,\nfurnished in the data, we ultimately find, as the developed expression of z,\nz = P(XT ) + 0\u00aft1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftn\nP(X), (2)\nwhere X represents in succession each constituent found in \u03d5, and T a\nsimilar series of constituents of the symbols t1, . . . tn; P(XT ) including only\nsymmetrical constituents with reference to the two sets of symbols.\nThe method of reduction to be employed in the present case is so similar to\nthe one already exemplified in former problems, that I shall merely exhibit the\nresults to which it leads. We find\nProb. z = M\nM + N (3)\nwith the relations\nM1\nc1p1\n. . . = Mn\ncnpn\n= N1\nc1(1 \u2212 p1) = Nn\ncn(1 \u2212 pn) = M + N. (4)\nWherein M is formed by suppressing in \u03d5(x2, . . . xn) all the factors \u00afx1, . . . \u00afxn,\nand changing in the result x1 into m1, xn into mn, while N is formed by\nsubstituting in M , n1 for m1, &c.; moreover M1 consists of that portion of M\nof which m1 is a factor, N1 of that portion of N of which n1 is a factor; and so\non.\nLet us take, in illustration, the particular case in which the causes A1 . . . An\nare mutually exclusive. Here we have\n\u03d5(x1, . . . xn) = x1 \u00afx2 . . . \u00afxn . . . + xn \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn\u22121.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 278\nWhence\nM = m1 + m2 . . . + mn,\nN = n1 + n2 . . . + nn,\nM1 = m1, N1 = n1, &c.\nSubstituting, we have\nm1\nc1p1\n. . . = mn\ncnpn\n= n1\nc1(1 \u2212 p1) . . . = nn\ncn(1 \u2212 pn) = M + N.\nHence we find m1 + m2 . . . + mn\nc1p1 + c2p2 . . . + cnpn\n= M + N,\nor M\nc1p1 . . . + cnpn\n= M + N.\nHence, by (3),\nProb. z = c1p1 . . . + cnpn,\na known result.\nThere are other particular cases in which the system (4) admits of ready\nsolution. It is, however, obvious that in most instances it would lead to results\nof great complexity. Nor does it seem probable that the existence of a functional\nrelation among causes, such as is assumed in the data of the general problem,\nwill often be presented in actual experience; if we except only the particular\ncases above discussed.\nHad the general problem been modified by the restriction that the event E\ncannot occur, all the causes A1 . . . An being absent, instead of the restriction\nthat the said causes cannot all fail, the remaining condition denoted by the\nequation \u03d5(A1, . . . An) = 1 being retained, we should have found for the final\nlogical equation\nz = X\n1\n(XT ) + 0 X(X),\nP(X) being, as before, equal to \u03d5(x1, . . . xn), but P\n1(XT ) formed by rejecting\nfrom \u03d5 the particular constituent \u00afx1 . . . \u00afxn if therein contained, and then\nmultiplying each x-constituent of the result by the corresponding t-constituent.\nIt is obvious that in the particular case in which the causes are mutually\nexclusive the value of Prob. z hence deduced will be the same as before.\n18. Problem IX.\u2014Assuming the data of any of the previous problems, let\nit be required to determine the probability that if the event E present itself, it\nwill be associated with the particular cause Ar ; in other words, to determine the\n`a posteriori probability of the cause Ar when the event E has been observed to\noccur.\nIn this case we must seek the value of the fraction\nProb. xr z\nProb. z , or cr pr\nProb. z , by the data. (1)\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 279\nAs in the previous problems, the value of Prob. z has been assigned upon\ndifferent hypotheses relative to the connexion or want of connexion of the causes,\nit is evident that in all those cases the present problem is susceptible of a\ndeterminate solution by simply substituting in (1) the value of that element\nthus determined.\nIf the `a priori probabilities of the causes are equal, we have c1 = c2 . . . = cr .\nHence for the different causes the value (1) will vary directly as the quantity\npr . Wherefore whatever the nature of the connexion among the causes, the `a\nposteriori probability of each cause will be proportional to the probability of\nthe observed event E when that cause is known to exist. The particular case\nof this theorem, which presents itself when the causes are mutually exclusive, is\nwell known. We have then\nProb. xr z\nProb. z = cr pr\nPcr pr\n= pr\np1 + p2 . . . + pn\n,\nthe values of c1, . . . cn being equal.\nAlthough, for the demonstration of these and similar theorems in the\nparticular case in which the causes are mutually exclusive, it is not necessary to\nintroduce the functional symbol \u03d5, which is, indeed, to claim for ourselves the\nchoice of all possible and conceivable hypotheses of the connexion of the causes,\nyet, under every form, the solution by the method of this work of problems,\nin which the number of the data is indefinitely great, must always partake of\na somewhat complex character. Whether the systematic evolution which it\npresents, first, of the logical, secondly, of the numerical relations of a problem,\nfurnishes any compensation for the length and occasional tediousness of its\nprocesses, I do not presume to inquire. Its chief value undoubtedly consists\nin its power,\u2014in the mastery which it gives us over questions which would\napparently baffle the unassisted strength of human reason. For this cause it\nhas not been deemed superfluous to exhibit in this chapter its application to\nproblems, some of which may possibly be regarded as repulsive, from their\ndifficulty, without being recommended by any prospect of immediate utility.\nOf the ulterior value of such speculations it is, I conceive, impossible for us, at\npresent, to form any decided judgment.\n19. The following problem is of a much easier description than the previous\nones.\nProblem X.\u2014The probability of the occurrence of a certain natural ph\u00e6nomenon\nunder given circumstances is p. Observation has also recorded a probability a of\nthe existence of a permanent cause of that ph\u00e6nomenon, i.e. of a cause which\nwould always produce the event under the circumstances supposed. What is the\nprobability that if the ph\u00e6nomenon is observed to occur n times in succession\nunder the given circumstances, it will occur the n + 1th time? What also is\nthe probability, after such observation, of the existence of the permanent cause\nreferred to?\nFirst Case.\u2014Let t represent the existence of a permanent cause, and\nx1, x2 . . . xn+1 the successive occurrences of the natural ph\u00e6nomenon.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 280\nIf the permanent cause exist, the events x1, x2 . . . xn+1 are necessary\nconsequences. Hence\nt = vx1, t = vx2, &c.,\nand eliminating the indefinite symbols,\nt(1 \u2212 x1) = 0, t(1 \u2212 x2) = 0, t(1 \u2212 xn+1) = 0.\nNow we are to seek the probability that if the combination x1x2 . . . xn happen,\nthe event xn+1 will happen, i.e. we are to seek the value of the fraction\nProb. x1x2 . . . xn+1\nProb. x1x2 . . . xn\n.\nWe will first seek the value of Prob. x1x2 . . . xn. Represent the combination\nx1 x2 . . . xn by w, then we have the following logical equations:\nt(1 \u2212 x1) = 0, t(1 \u2212 x2) = 0, . . . t(1 \u2212 xn) = 0,\nx1 x2 . . . xn = w.\nReducing the last to the form\n(x1 x2 . . . xn)(1 \u2212 w) + w(1 \u2212 x1 x2 . . . xn) = 0,\nand adding it to the former ones, we have\nX t(1 \u2212 xi) + x1 x2 . . . xn(1 \u2212 w) + w(1 \u2212 x1 x2 . . . xn) = 0, (1)\nwherein P extends to all values of i from 1 to n, for the one logical equation of\nthe data. With this we must connect the numerical conditions,\nProb. x1 = Prob. x2 . . . = Prob. xn = p, Prob. t = a;\nand our object is to find Prob, w.\nFrom (1) we have\nw =\nP t(1 \u2212 xi) + x1 x2 . . . xn\n2x1 x2 . . . xn \u2212 1\n=\nP(1 \u2212 xi) + x1 x2 . . . xn\n2x1 x2 . . . xn \u2212 1 t + x1 x2 . . . xn\n2x1 x2 . . . xn \u2212 1 (1 \u2212 t), (2)\non developing with respect to t. This result must further be developed with\nrespect to x1, x2, . . . xn.\nNow if we make x1 = 1, x2 = 1, . . . xn = 1, the coefficients both of t and of\n1 \u2212 t become 1. If we give to the same symbols any other set of values formed\nby the interchange of 0 and 1, it is evident that the coefficient of t will become\nnegative, while that of 1 \u2212 t will become 0. Hence the full development (2) will\nbe\nw = x1x2 . . . xnt + x1x2 . . . xn(1 \u2212 t) + 0(1 \u2212 x1x2 . . . xn)(1 \u2212 t)\n+ constituents whose coefficients are 1\n0 , or equivalent to 1\n0 .\nCHAPTER XX.

Substituting then for the numerator\nand denominator of the above fraction their values, we have for the `a posteriori\nprobability of a permanent cause, the expression\na\na + (p \u2212 a)\n\u0012 p \u2212 a\n1 \u2212 a\n\u0013n\u22121 .\nIt is obvious that the value of this expression increases with the value of n.\nI am indebted to a learned correspondent,6 whose original contributions\nto the theory of probabilities have already been referred to, for the following\nverification of the first of the above results (3).\n5As we can neither re-enter nor recall the state of infancy, we are unable to say how far\nsuch results as the above serve to explain the confidence with which young children connect\nevents whose association they have once perceived. But we may conjecture, generally, that\nthe strength of their expectations is due to the necessity of inferring (as a part of their rational\nnature), and the narrow but impressive experience upon which the faculty is exercised.

It is remarkable that the solutions of the previous problems are void of\nany arbitrary element. We should scarcely, from the appearance of the data,\nhave anticipated such a circumstance. It is, however, to be observed, that\nin all those problems the probabilities of the causes involved are supposed to\nbe known `a priori. In the absence of this assumed element of knowledge, it\nseems probable that arbitrary constants would necessarily appear in the final\nsolution. Some confirmation of this remark is afforded by a class of problems to\nwhich considerable attention has been directed, and which, in conclusion, I shall\nbriefly consider. It has been observed that there exists in the heavens a large\nnumber of double stars of extreme closeness. Either these apparent instances\nof connexion have some physical ground or they have not. If they have not,\nwe may regard the phenomenon of a double star as the accidental result of\na \u201crandom distribution\u201d of stars over the celestial vault, i.e. of a distribution\nwhich would render it just as probable that either member of the binary system\nshould appear in one spot as in another. If this hypothesis be assumed, and if\nthe number of stars of a requisite brightness be known, we can determine what\nis the probability that two of them should be found within such limits of mutual\ndistance as to constitute the observed phenomenon. Thus Mitchell,7 estimating\nthat there are 230 stars in the heavens equal in brightness to \u03b2 Capricorni,\ndetermines that it is 80 to 1 against such a combination being presented were\nthose stars distributed at random. The probability, when such a combination\nhas been observed, that there exists between its members a physical ground of\nconnexion, is then required.\nAgain, the sum of the inclinations of the orbits of the ten known planets\nto the plane of the ecliptic in the year 1801 was 91\u25e6\u00b74187, according to the\nFrench measures. Were all inclinations equally probable, Laplace8 determines,\nthat there would be only the excessively small probability .00000011235 that\nthe mean of the inclinations should fall within the limit thus assigned. And he\nhence concludes, that there is a very high probability in favour of a disposing\ncause, by which the inclinations of the planetary orbits have been confined\nwithin such narrow bounds. Professor De Morgan,9 taking the sum of the\ninclinations at 92\u25e6, gives to the above probability the value .00000012, and infers\nthat \u201cit is 1 : .00000012, that there was a necessary cause in the formation of the\nsolar system for the inclinations being what they are.\u201d An equally determinate\n7Phil.

PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 285\nconclusion has been drawn from observed coincidences between the direction\nof circular polarization in rock-crystal, and that of certain oblique faces in its\ncrystalline structure.10\nThese problems are all of a similar character. A certain hypothesis is\nframed, of the various possible consequences of which we are able to assign\nthe probabilities with perfect rigour. Now some actual result of observation\nbeing found among those consequences, and its hypothetical probability being\ntherefore known, it is required thence to determine the probability of the\nhypothesis assumed, or its contrary. In Mitchell\u2019s problem, the hypothesis\nis that of a \u201crandom distribution of the stars,\u201d\u2014the possible and observed\nconsequence, the appearance of a close double star. The very small probability\nof such a result is held to imply that the probability of the hypothesis is equally\nsmall, or, at least, of the same order of smallness. And hence the high and,\nand as some think, determinate probability of a disposing cause in the stellar\narrangements is inferred. Similar remarks apply to the other examples adduced.\n21. The general problem, in whatsoever form it may be presented, admits\nonly of an indefinite solution. Let x represent the proposed hypothesis, y a\nph\u00e6nomenon which might occur as one of its possible consequences, and whose\ncalculated probability, on the assumption of the truth of the hypothesis, is p,\nand let it be required to determine the probability that if the ph\u00e6nomenon y\nis observed, the hypothesis x is true. The very data of this problem cannot be\nexpressed without the introduction of an arbitrary element. We can only write\nProb. x = a, Prob. xy = ap; (1)\na being perfectly arbitrary, except that it must fall within the limits 0 and 1\ninclusive. If then P represent the conditional probability sought, we have\nP = Prob. xy\nProb. y = ap\nProb. y . (2)\nIt remains then to determine Prob. y. Let xy = t, then\ny = t\nx = tx + 1\n0 t(1 \u2212 x) + 0(1 \u2212 t)x + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 x). (3)\nHence observing that Prob. x = a, Prob. t = ap, and passing from Logic to\nAlgebra, we have\nProb. y = tx + c(1 \u2212 t)x\ntx + 1 \u2212 t ,\nwith the relations tx + (1 \u2212 t)x\na = tx\nap = tx + 1 \u2212 t.\nHence we readily find\nProb. y = ap + c(1 \u2212 a). (4)\n10Edinburgh Review, No. 185, p. 32. This article, though not entirely free from error, is\nwell worthy of attention.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 286\nNow recurring to (3), we find that c is the probability, that if the event\n(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 x) occur, the event y will occur. But\n(1 \u2212 t)(1 \u2212 x) = (1 \u2212 xy)(1 \u2212 x) = 1 \u2212 x.\nHence c is the probability that if the event x do not occur, the event y will\noccur.\nSubstituting the value of Prob. y in (2), we have the following theorem:\nThe calculated probability of any ph\u00e6nomenon y, upon an assumed physical\nhypothesis x, being p, the `a posteriori probability P of the physical hypothesis,\nwhen the ph\u00e6nomenon has been observed, is expressed by the equation\nP = ap\nap + c(1 \u2212 a) , (5)\nwhere a and c are arbitrary constants, the former representing the `a priori\nprobability of the hypothesis, the latter the probability that if the hypothesis were\nfalse, the event y would present itself.\nThe principal conclusion deducible from the above theorem is that, other\nthings being the same, the value of P increases and diminishes simultaneously\nwith that of p. Hence the greater or less the probability of the ph\u00e6nomenon\nwhen the hypothesis is assumed, the greater or less is the probability of the\nhypothesis when the ph\u00e6nomenon has been observed. When p is very small,\nthen generally P also is small, unless either a is large or c small. Hence, secondly,\nif the probability of the ph\u00e6nomenon is very small when the hypothesis is\nassumed, the probability of the hypothesis is very small when the ph\u00e6nomenon\nis observed, unless either the `a priori probability a of the hypothesis is large,\nor the probability of the ph\u00e6nomenon upon any other hypothesis small.\nThe formula (5) admits of exact verification in various cases, as when c =\n0, or a = 1, or a = 0. But it is evident that it does not, unless there\nbe means for determining the values of a and c, yield a definite value of P .\nAny solutions which profess to accomplish this object, either are erroneous in\nprinciple, or involve a tacit assumption respecting the above arbitrary elements.\nMr. De Morgan\u2019s solution of Laplace\u2019s problem concerning the existence of a\ndetermining cause of the narrow limits within which the inclinations of the\nplanetary orbits to the plane of the ecliptic are confined, appears to me to be of\nthe latter description. Having found a probability p = .00000012, that the sum\nof the inclinations would be less than 92\u25e6 were all degrees of inclination equally\nprobable in each orbit, this able writer remarks: \u201cIf there be a reason for the\ninclinations being as described, the probability of the event is 1. Consequently,\nit is 1 : .00000012 (i.e. 1 : p), that there was a necessary cause in the formation\nof the solar system for the inclinations being what they are.\u201d Now this result is\nwhat the equation (5) would really give, if, assigning to p the above value, we\nshould assume c = 1, a = 1\n2 . For we should thus find,\nP =\n1\n2 p\n1\n2 p + 1\n2\n= p\n1 + p\n\u2234 1 \u2212 P : P : : 1 : p. (6)\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 287\nBut P representing the probability, `a posteriori, that all inclinations are\nequally probable, 1 \u2212 P is the probability, `a posteriori, that such is not the case,\nor, adopting Mr. De Morgan\u2019s alternative, that a determining cause exists. The\nequation (6), therefore, agrees with Mr. De Morgan\u2019s result.\n22. Are we, however, justified in assigning to a and c particular values? I am\nstrongly disposed to think that we are not. The question is of less importance\nin the special instance than in its ulterior bearings. In the received applications\nof the theory of probabilities, arbitrary constants do not explicitly appear; but\nin the above, and in many other instances sanctioned by the highest authorities,\nsome virtual determination of them has been attempted. And this circumstance\nhas given to the results of the theory, especially in reference to questions of\ncausation, a character of definite precision, which, while on the one hand it\nhas seemed to exalt the dominion and extend the province of numbers, even\nbeyond the measure of their ancient claim to rule the world;11 on the other\nhand has called forth vigorous protests against their intrusion into realms in\nwhich conjecture is the only basis of inference. The very fact of the appearance\nof arbitrary constants in the solutions of problems like the above, treated by the\nmethod of this work, seems to imply, that definite solution is impossible, and\nto mark the point where inquiry ought to stop. We possess indeed the means\nof interpreting those constants, but the experience which is thus indicated is as\nmuch beyond our reach as the experience which would preclude the necessity of\nany attempt at solution whatever.\nAnother difficulty attendant upon these questions, and inherent, perhaps,\nin the very constitution of our faculties, is that of precisely defining what is\nmeant by Order. The manifestations of that principle, except in very complex\ninstances, we have no difficulty in detecting, nor do we hesitate to impute to it\nan almost necessary foundation in causes operating under Law. But to assign\nto it a standard of numerical value would be a vain, not to say a presumptuous,\nendeavour. Yet must the attempt be made, before we can aspire to weigh with\naccuracy the probabilities12 13 of different constitutions of the universe, so as\nto determine the elements upon which alone a definite solution of the problems\nin question can be established.\n23. The most usual mode of endeavouring to evade the necessary arbitrariness\nof the solution of problems in the theory of probabilities which rest upon\ninsufficient data, is to assign to some element whose real probability is unknown\nall possible degrees of probability; to suppose that these degrees of probability\nare themselves equally probable; and, regarding them as so many distinct causes\nof the phenomenon observed, to apply the theorems which represent the case of\nan effect due to some one of a number of equally probable but mutually exclusive\ncauses (Problem 9). For instance, the rising of the sun after a certain interval\n11Mundum regunt numeri.\n12Original text was \u201cprobabibilities\u201d and was fixed in 2004 by Distributed Proofreaders.\n13The following footnote was in the original text but was not referenced in the text, so it is\nreferenced here14 in 2004 by Distributed Proofreaders.\n14See an interesting paper by Prof. Forbes in the Philosophical Magazine, Dec. 1850; also\nMill\u2019s Logic, chap, xviii.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 288\nof darkness having been observed m times in succession, the probability of its\nagain rising under the same circumstances is determined, on received principles,\nin the following manner. Let p be any unknown probability between 0 and 1,\nand c (infinitesimal and constant) the probability, that the probability of the\nsun\u2019s rising after an interval of darkness lies between the limits p and p + dp.\nThen the probability that the sun will rise m times in succession is\nc\nZ 1\n0\npmdp;\nand the probability that he will do this, and will rise again, or, which is the\nsame thing, that he will rise m + 1 times in succession, is\nc\nZ 1\n0\npm+1dp,\nHence the probability that if he rise m times in succession, he will rise the\nm + 1th time, is\nc R 1\n0 pm+1dp\nc R 1\n0 pmdp = m + 1\nm + 2 ,\nthe known and generally received solution.\nThe above solution is usually founded upon a supposed analogy of the\nproblem with that of the drawing of balls from an urn containing a mixture of\nblack and white balls, between which all possible numerical ratios are assumed\nto be equally probable. And it is remarkable, that there are two or three distinct\nhypotheses which lead to the same final result. For instance, if the balls are finite\nin number, and those which arc drawn are not replaced, or if they are infinite\nin number, whether those drawn are replaced or not, then, supposing that m\nsuccessive drawings have yielded only white balls, the probability of the issue\nof a white ball at the m + 1th drawing is\nm + 1\nm + 2 .15\nIt has been said, that the principle involved in the above and in similar\napplications is that of the equal distribution of our knowledge, or rather of our\nignorance\u2014the assigning to different states of things of which we know nothing,\nand upon the very ground that we know nothing, equal degrees of probability.\nI apprehend, however, that this is an arbitrary method of procedure. Instances\nmay occur, and one such has been adduced, in which different hypotheses lead to\nthe same final conclusion. But those instances are exceptional. With reference\nto the particular problem in question, it is shown in the memoir cited, that\nthere is one hypothesis, viz., when the balls are finite in number and not\nreplaced, which leads to a different conclusion, and it is easy to see that there are\nother hypotheses, as strictly involving the principle of the \u201cequal distribution\nof knowledge or ignorance,\u201d which would also conduct to conflicting results.\n15See a memoir by Bishop Terrot, Edinburgh Phil. Trans. vol. xx. Part iv.\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 289\n24. For instance, let the case of sunrise be represented by the drawing of a\nwhite ball from a bag containing an infinite number of balls, which are all either\nblack or white, and let the assumed principle be, that all possible constitutions\nof the system of balls are equally probable. By a constitution of the system, I\nmean an arrangement which assigns to every ball in the system a determinate\ncolour, either black or white. Let us thence seek the probability, that if m\nwhite balls are drawn in m drawings, a white ball will be drawn in the m + 1th\ndrawing.\nFirst, suppose the number of the balls to be \u03bc, and let the symbols\nx1, x2, . . . x\u03bc be appropriated to them in the following manner. Let xi\ndenote that event which consists in the ith ball of the system being white,\nthe proposition declaratory of such a state of things being xi = 1. In like\nmanner the compound symbol 1 \u2212 xi will represent the circumstance of the ith\nball being black. It is evident that the several constituents formed of the entire\nset of symbols x1, x2, . . . x\u03bc will represent in like manner the several possible\nconstitutions of the system of balls with respect to blackness and whiteness,\nand the number of such constitutions being 2\u03bc, the probability of each will, in\naccordance with the hypothesis, be 1\n2\u03bc . This is the value which we should find\nif we substituted in the expression of any constituent for\neach of the symbols x1, x2, . . . x\u03bc, the value 1\n2 . Hence, then, the probability\nof any event which can be expressed as a series of constituents of the above\ndescription, will be found by substituting in such expression the value 1\n2 for\neach of the above symbols.\nNow the larger \u03bc is, the less probable it is that any ball which has been drawn\nand replaced will be drawn again. As \u03bc. approaches to infinity, this probability\napproaches to 0. And this being the case, the state of the balls actually drawn\ncan be expressed as a logical function of m of the symbols x1, x2, . . . x\u03bc, and\ntherefore, by development, as a series of constituents of the said m symbols.\nHence, therefore, its probability will be found by substituting for each of the\nsymbols, whether in the undeveloped or the developed form, the value 1\n2 . But\nthis is the very substitution which it would be necessary, and which it would\nsuffice, to make, if the probability of a white ball at each drawing were known,\n`a priori, to be 1\n2 .\nIt follows, therefore, that if the number of balls be infinite, and all\nconstitutions of the system equally probable, the probability of drawing m\nwhite balls in succession will be 1\n2m , and the probability of drawing m + 1 white\nballs in succession 1\n2m+1 ;\nwhence the probability that after m white balls have been drawn, the next\ndrawing will furnish a white one, will be 1\n2 . In other words, past experience\ndoes not in this case affect future expectation.\n25. It may be satisfactory to verify this result by ordinary methods. To\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 290\naccomplish this, we shall seek\u2014\nFirst: The probability of drawing r white balls, and p \u2212 r black balls, in p\ntrials, out of a bag containing \u03bc balls, every ball being replaced after drawing,\nand all constitutions of the systems being equally probable, `a priori.\nSecondly: The value which this probability assumes when \u03bc becomes infinite.\nThirdly: The probability hence derived, that if m white balls are drawn in\nsuccession, the m + 1th ball drawn will be white also.\nThe probability that r white balls and p \u2212 r black ones will be drawn in p\ntrials out of an urn containing \u03bc balls, each ball being replaced after trial, and\nall constitutions of the system as above defined being equally probable, is equal\nto the sum of the probabilities of the same result upon the separate hypotheses\nof there being no white balls, 1 white ball,\u2014lastly \u03bc white balls in the urn.\nTherefore, it is the sum of the probabilities of this result on the hypothesis of\nthere being n white balls, n varying from 0 to \u03bc.\nNow supposing that there are n white balls, the probability of drawing a\nwhite ball in a single drawing is n\n\u03bc , and the probability of drawing r white balls\nand p \u2212 r black ones in a particular order in p drawings, is\n\u0012 n\n\u03bc\n\u0013r \u0012\n1 \u2212 n\n\u03bc\n\u0013p\u2212r\nBut there being as many such orders as there are combinations of r things in p\nthings, the total probability of drawing r white balls in p drawings out of the\nsystem of \u03bc balls of which n are white, is\np(p \u2212 1) . . .

PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 292\nHence if \u03d5(D) represent any function of the symbol D, which is capable of being\nexpanded in a series of ascending powers of D, we have\n\u03d5(D)(1 + \u03b5\u03b8 )\u03bc = \u03d5\n\u0010 \u03bc\n2\n\u0011\n2\u03bc, (4)\nif \u03b8 = 0 and \u03bc = \u221e. Strictly speaking, this implies that the ratio of the two\nmembers of the above equation approaches a state of equality, as \u03bc increases\ntowards infinity, \u03b8 being equal to 0.\nBy means of this theorem, the last member of (3) reduces to the form\n1\n2\u03bc\n\u0012 1\n2\n\u0013r \u0012\n1 \u2212 1\n2\n\u0013p\u2212r\n2\u03bc =\n\u0012 1\n2\n\u0013p\n.\nHence (2) gives\np(p \u2212 1) . . .

These results only illustrate the fact, that when the defect of data is\nsupplied by hypothesis, the solutions will, in general, vary with the nature of\nthe hypotheses assumed; so that the question still remains, only more definite\nin form, whether the principles of the theory of probabilities serve to guide\nus in the election of such hypotheses. I have already expressed my conviction\nthat they do not\u2014a conviction strengthened by other reasons than those above\nstated. Thus, a definite solution of a problem having been found by the method\nof this work, an equally definite solution is sometimes attainable by the same\nmethod when one of the data, suppose Prob. x = p1 is omitted. But I have not\nbeen able to discover any mode of deducing the second solution from the first\nby integration, with respect to p supposed variable within limits determined by\nChap. xix. This deduction would, however, I conceive, be possible, were the\nprinciple adverted to in Art. 23 valid. Still it is with diffidence that I express\nmy dissent on these points from mathematicians generally, and more especially\nCHAPTER XX. PROBLEMS ON CAUSES 293\nfrom one who, of English writers, has most fully entered into the spirit and the\nmethods of Laplace; and I venture to hope, that a question, second to none other\nin the Theory of Probabilities in importance, will receive the careful attention\nwhich it deserves.\nChapter XXI\nPARTICULAR APPLICATION OF THE PREVIOUS\nGENERAL METHOD TO THE QUESTION OF THE\nPROBABILITY OF JUDGMENTS.\n1. On the presumption that the general method of this treatise for the solution\nof questions in the theory of probabilities, has been sufficiently elucidated in\nthe previous chapters, it is proposed here to enter upon one of its practical\napplications selected out of the wide field of social statistics, viz., the estimation\nof the probability of judgments. Perhaps this application, if weighed by its\nimmediate results, is not the best that could have been chosen. One of the first\nconclusions to which it leads is that of the necessary insufficiency of any data\nthat experience alone can furnish, for the accomplishment of the most important\nobject of the inquiry. But in setting clearly before us the necessity of hypotheses\nas supplementary to the data of experience, and in enabling us to deduce with\nrigour the consequences of any hypothesis which may be assumed, the method\naccomplishes all that properly lies within its scope. And it may be remarked,\nthat in questions which relate to the conduct of our own species, hypotheses are\nmore justifiable than in questions such as those referred to in the concluding\nsections of the previous chapter. Our general experience of human nature comes\nin aid of the scantiness and imperfection of statistical records.\n2. The elements involved in problems relating to criminal assize are the\nfollowing:\u2014\n1st. The probability that a particular member of the jury will form a correct\nopinion upon the case.\n2nd. The probability that the accused party is guilty.\n3rd. The probability that he will be condemned, or that he will be acquitted.\n4th. The probability that his condemnation or acquittal will be just.\n5th. The constitution of the jury.\n6th. The data furnished by experience, such as the relative numbers of cases\nin which unanimous decisions have been arrived at, or particular majorities\nobtained; the number of cases in which decisions have been reversed by superior\ncourts, &c.\nAgain, the class of questions under consideration may be regarded as either\ndirect or inverse. The direct questions of probability are those in which the\n294\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 295\nprobability of correct decision for each member of the tribunal, or of guilt for the\naccused party, are supposed to be known `a priori, and in which the probability\nof a decision of a particular kind, or with a definite majority, is sought. Inverse\nproblems are those in which, from the data furnished by experience, it is required\nto determine some element which, though it stand to those data in the relation of\ncause to effect, cannot directly be made the subject of observation; as when from\nthe records of the decisions of courts it is required to determine the probability\nthat a member of a court will judge correctly. To this species of problems, the\nmost difficult and the most important of the whole series, attention will chiefly\nbe directed here.\n3. There is no difficulty in solving the direct problems referred to in the\nabove enumeration. Suppose there is but one juryman. Let k be the probability\nthat the accused person is guilty; x the probability that the juryman will form a\ncorrect opinion; X the probability that the accused person will be condemned:\nthen\u2014\nkx = probability that the accused party is guilty, and that the\njuryman judges him to be guilty.\n(l \u2212 k)(l \u2212 x) = probability that the accused person is inno-\ncent, and that the juryman pronounces him guilty.\nNow these being the only cases in which a verdict of condemnation can be\ngiven, and being moreover mutually exclusive, we have\nX = kx + (1 \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 x). (1)\nIn like manner, if there be n jurymen whose separate probabilities of\ncorrect judgment are x1, x2, . . . xn, the probability of an unanimous verdict of\ncondemnation will be\nX = kx1x2 . . . xn + (1 \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 x1)(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn).\nWhence, if the several probabilities x1, x2 . . . xn are equal, and are each\nrepresented by x, we have\nX = kxn + (1 \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 x)n. (2)\nThe probability in the latter case, that the accused person is guilty, will be\nkxn\nkxn + (1 \u2212 k)(1 \u2212 x)n\nAll these results assume, that the events whose probabilities are denoted by k,\nx1, x2, &c., are independent, an assumption which, however, so far as we are\nconcerned, is involved in the fact that those events are the only ones of which\nthe probabilities are given.\nThe probability of condemnation by a given number of voices may be found\non the same principles. If a jury is composed of three persons, whose several\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 296\nprobabilities of correct decision are x, x\u2032, x\u2032\u2032, the probability X2 that the accused\nperson will be declared guilty by two of them will be\nX2 = k{xx\u2032(1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032) + xx\u2032\u2032(1 \u2212 x\u2032) + x\u2032x\u2032\u2032(1 \u2212 x)}\n+(1 \u2212 k){(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 x\u2032)x\u2032\u2032 + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032)x\u2032 + (1 \u2212 x\u2032)(1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032)x},\nwhich if x = x\u2032 = x\u2032\u2032 reduces to\n3kx2(1 \u2212 x) + 3(1 \u2212 k)x(1 \u2212 x)2.\nAnd by the same mode of reasoning, it will appear that if Xi represent the\nprobability that the accused person will be declared guilty by i voices out of a\njury consisting of n persons, whose separate probabilities of correct judgment\nare equal, and represented by x, then\nXi = n(n \u2212 1) . . . (n \u2212 i + 1)\n1 \u0005 2 . . . i {kxi(1 \u2212 x)n\u2212i + (1 \u2212 k)xn\u2212i(1 \u2212 x)i}. (3)\nIf the probability of condemnation by a determinate majority a is required, we\nhave simply\ni \u2212 a = n \u2212 i,\nwhence\ni = n + a\n2 ,\nwhich must be substituted in the above formula. Of course a admits only of\nsuch values as make i an integer. If n is even, those values are 0, 2, 4, &c.; if\nodd, 1, 3, 5, &c., as is otherwise obvious.\nThe probability of a condemnation by a majority of at least a given number\nof voices m, will be found by adding together the following several probabilities\ndetermined as above, viz.:\n1st. The probability of a condemnation by an exact majority\nm;\n2nd. The probability of condemnation by the next greater\nmajority m + 2;\nand so on; the last element of the series being the probability of unanimous\ncondemnation. Thus the probability of condemnation by a majority of 4 at\nleast out of 12 jurors, would be\nX8 + X9 . . . + X12,\nthe values of the above terms being given by (3) after making therein n = 12.\n4. When, instead of a jury, we are considering the case of a simple\ndeliberative assembly consisting of n persons, whose separate probabilities\nof correct judgment are denoted by x, the above formul\u00e6 are replaced by\nothers, made somewhat more simple by the omission of the quantity k.\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 297\nThe probability of unanimous decision is\nX = xn + (1 \u2212 x)n.\nThe probability of an agreement of i voices out of the whole number is\nXi = n(n \u2212 1) . . . (n \u2212 i + 1)\n1 \u00b7 2 . . . i {xi(1 \u2212 x)n\u2212i + xn\u2212i(1 \u2212 x)i}. (4)\nOf this class of investigations it is unnecessary to give any further account.\nThey have been pursued to a considerable extent by Condorcet, Laplace,\nPoisson, and other writers, who have investigated in particular the modes of\ncalculation and reduction which are necessary to be employed when n and i are\nlarge numbers. It is apparent that the whole inquiry is of a very speculative\ncharacter. The values of x and k cannot be determined by direct observation.\nWe can only presume that they must both in general exceed the value 1\n2 ; that\nthe former, x, must increase with the progress of public intelligence; while the\nlatter, k, must depend much upon those preliminary steps in the administration\nof the law by which persons suspected of crime are brought before the tribunal\nof their country. It has been remarked by Poisson, that in periods of revolution,\nas during the Reign of Terror in France, the value of k may fall, if account be\ntaken of political offences, far below the limit 1\n2 . The history of Europe in days\nnearer to our own would probably confirm this observation, and would show\nthat it is not from the wild license of democracy alone, that the accusation of\ninnocence is to be apprehended.\nLaplace makes the assumption, that all values of x from\nx = 1\n2 ; to x = 1,\nare equally probable. He thus excludes the supposition that a juryman is\nmore likely to be deceived than not, but assumes that within the limits to\nwhich the probabilities of individual correctness of judgment are confined,\nwe have no reason to give preference to one value of x over another. This\nhypothesis is entirely arbitrary, and it would be unavailing here to examine into\nits consequences.\nPoisson seems first to have endeavoured to deduce the values of x and k,\ninferentially, from experience. In the six years from 1825 to 1830 inclusively, the\nnumber of individuals accused of crimes against the person before the tribunals\nof France was 11016, and the number of persons condemned was 5286. The\njuries consisted each of 12 persons, and the decision was pronounced by a\nsimple majority. Assuming the above numbers to be sufficiently large for the\nestimation of probabilities, there would therefore be a probability measured by\nthe fraction 5286\n11016 or .4782 that an accused person would be condemned by a\nsimple majority. We should have the equation\nX7 + X8 . . . + X12 = .4782, (5)\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 298\nthe general expression for Xi being given by (3) after making therein n = 12.\nIn the year 1831 the law, having received alteration, required a majority of at\nleast four persons for condemnation, and the number of persons tried for crimes\nagainst the person during that year being 2046, and the number condemned 743,\nthe probability of the condemnation of an individual by the above majority was\n743\n2046 , or .3631. Hence we should have\nX8 + X9 . . . + X12 = .3631 . (6)\nAssuming that the values of k and x were the same for the year 1831 as for\nthe previous six years, the two equations (5) and (6) enable us to determine\napproximately their values. Poisson thus found,\nk = .5354, x = .6786 .\nFor crimes against property during the same periods, he found by a similar\nanalysis,\nk = .6744, x = .7771 .\nThe solution of the system (5) (6) conducts in each case to two values of\nk, and to two values of x, the one value in each pair being greater, and the\nother less, than 1\n2 . It was assumed, that in each case the larger value should\nbe preferred, it being conceived more probable that a party accused should be\nguilty than innocent, and more probable that a juryman should form a correct\nthan an erroneous opinion upon the evidence.\n5. The data employed by Poisson, especially those which were furnished\nby the year 1831, are evidently too imperfect to permit us to attach much\nconfidence to the above determinations of x and k; and it is chiefly for the sake\nof the method that they are here introduced. It would have been possible to\nrecord during the six years, 1825-30, or during any similar period, the number\nof condemnations pronounced with each possible majority of voices. The values\nof the several elements X8, X9, . . . X12 were there no reasons of policy to forbid,\nmight have been accurately ascertained. Here then the conception of the general\nproblem, of which Poisson\u2019s is a particular case, arises. How shall we, from this\napparently supernumerary system of data, determine the values of x and k?\nIf the hypothesis, adopted by Poisson and all other writers on the subject, of\nthe absolute independence of the events whose probabilities are denoted by x\nand k be retained, we should be led to form a system of five equations of the\ntype (3), and either select from these that particular pair of equations which\nmight appear to be most advantageous, or combine together the equations of the\nsystem by the method of least squares. There might exist a doubt as to whether\nthe latter method would be strictly applicable in such cases, especially if the\nvalues of x and k afforded by different selected pairs of the given equations were\nvery different from each other. M. Cournot has considered a somewhat similar\nproblem, in which, from the records of individual votes in a court consisting of\nfour judges, it is proposed to investigate the separate probabilities of a correct\nverdict from each judge. For the determination of the elements x, x\u2032, x\u2032\u2032, x\u2032\u2032\u2032, he\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 299\nobtains eight equations, which he divides into two sets of four equations, and he\nremarks, that should any considerable discrepancy exist between the values of\nx, x\u2032, x\u2032\u2032, x\u2032\u2032\u2032, determined from those sets, it might be regarded as an indication\nthat the hypothesis of the independence of the opinions of the judges was, in\nthe particular case, untenable. The principle of this mode of investigation has\nbeen adverted to in (XVIII. 4).\n6. I proceed to apply to the class of problems above indicated, the method\nof this treatise, and shall inquire, first, whether the records of courts and\ndeliberative assemblies, alone, can furnish any information respecting the\nprobabilities of correct judgment for their individual members, and, it appearing\nthat they cannot, secondly, what kind and amount of necessary hypothesis will\nbest comport with the actual data.\nProposition I.\nFrom the mere records of the decisions of a court or deliberative assembly,\nit is not possible to deduce any definite conclusion respecting the correctness of\nthe individual judgments of its members.\nThough this Proposition may appear to express but the conviction of\nunassisted good sense, it will not be without interest to show that it admits\nof rigorous demonstration. Let us suppose the case of a deliberative assembly\nconsisting of n members, no hypothesis whatever being made respecting the\ndependence or independence of their judgments. Let the logical symbols\nx1, x2, . . . xn be employed according to the following definition, viz.: Let the\ngeneric symbol xi denote that event which consists in the uttering of a correct\nopinion by the ith member, Ai of the court. We shall consider the values of\nProb. x1, Prob. x2, . . . Prob. xn, as the qu\u00e6sita of a problem, the expression\nof whose possible data we must in the next place investigate.\nNow those data are the probabilities of events capable of being expressed\nby definite logical functions of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn. Let X1, X2, . . . Xm\nrepresent the functions in question, and let the actual system of data be\nProb. X1 = a1, Prob. X2 = a2, Prob. Xm = am.\nThen from the very nature of the case it may be shown that X1, X2, . . . Xm,\nare functions which remain unchanged if x1, x2, . . . xn are therein changed into\n1 \u2212 x1, 1 \u2212 x2, . . . 1 \u2212 xn respectively. Thus, if it were recorded that in a\ncertain proportion of instances the votes given were unanimous, the event whose\nprobability, supposing the instances sufficiently numerous, is thence determined,\nis expressed by the logical function\nx1x2 . . . xn + (1 \u2212 x1)(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn),\na function which satisfies the above condition. Again, let it be recorded, that in\na certain proportion of instances, the vote of an individual, suppose A1, differs\nfrom that of all the other members of the court. The event, whose probability\nis thus given, will be expressed by the function\nx1(1 \u2212 x2) . . . (1 \u2212 xn) + (1 \u2212 x1)x2 . . . xn;\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 300\nalso satisfying the above conditions. Thus, as agreement in opinion may be an\nagreement in either truth or error; and as, when opinions are divided, either\nparty may be right or wrong; it is manifest that the expression of any particular\nstate, whether of agreement or difference of sentiment in the assembly, will\ndepend upon a logical function of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn, which similarly\ninvolves the privative symbols 1 \u2212 x1, 1 \u2212 x2, . . . 1 \u2212 xn. But in the records of\nassemblies, it is not presumed to declare which set of opinions is right or wrong.\nHence the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm must be solely of the kind above described.\n7. Now in proceeding, according to the general method, to determine the\nvalue of Prob. x1, we should first equate the functions X1, . . . Xm to a new set\nof symbols t1, . . . tm. From the equations\nX1 = t1, X2 = t2, . . . Xm = tm,\nthus formed, we should eliminate the symbols x2, x3, . . . xn, and then determine\nx1 as a developed logical function of the symbols t1, t2, . . . tm, expressive of\nevents whose probabilities are given. Let the result of the above elimination be\nEx1 + E\u2032(1 \u2212 x1) = 0; (1)\nE and E\u2032 being function of t1, t2, . . . tm. Then\nx1 = E\u2032\nE\u2032 \u2212 E . (2)\nNow the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm are symmetrical with reference to the\nsymbols x1, . . . xn and 1 \u2212 x1, . . . 1 \u2212 xn. It is evident, therefore, that in the\nequation E\u2032 must be identical with E. Hence (2) gives\nx = E\n0 ,\nand it is evident, that the only coefficients which can appear in the development\nof the second member of the above equation are 0\n0 and 1\n0 . The former will present\nitself whenever the values assigned to t1, . . . tm in determining the coefficient of\na constituent, are such as to make E = 0, the latter, or an equivalent result, in\nevery other case. Hence we may represent the development under the form\nx1 = 0\n0 C + 1\n0 D (3)\nC and D being constituents, or aggregates of constituents, of the symbols\nt1, t2, . . . tm. Passing then from Logic to Algebra, we have\nProb. x1 = cC\nC = c,\nthe function V of the general Rule (XVII. 17) reducing in the present case to C.\nThe value of Prob. x1 is therefore wholly arbitrary, if we except the condition\nthat it must not transcend the limits 0 and 1. The individual values of Prob.\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 301\nx2, . . . Prob. xn, are in like manner arbitrary. It does not hence follow, that\nthese arbitrary values are not connected with each other by necessary conditions\ndependent upon the data. The investigation of such conditions would, however,\nproperly fall under the methods of Chap. xix.\nIf, reverting to the final logical equation, we seek the interpretation of c, we\nobtain but a restatement of the original problem. For since C and D together\ninclude all possible constituents of t1, t2, . . . tm, we have\nC + D = 1;\nand since D is affected by the coefficient 1\n0 , it is evident that on substituting\ntherein for t1, t2, . . . tm, their expressions in terms of x1, x2, . . . xn, we should\nhave D = 0. Hence the same substitution would give C = 1. Now by the\nrule, c is the probability that if the event denoted by C take place, the event\nx1 will take place. Hence C being equal to 1, and, therefore, embracing all\npossible contingencies, c must be interpreted as the absolute probability of the\noccurrence of the event x1.\nIt may be interesting to determine in a particular case the actual form of\nthe final logical equation. Suppose, then, that the elements from which the\ndata are derived are the records of events distinct and mutually exclusive. For\ninstance, let the numerical data a1, a2, . . . am, be the respective probabilities of\ndistinct and definite majorities. Then the logical functions X1, X2, . . . Xm being\nmutually exclusive, must satisfy the conditions\nX1X2 = 0, . . . X1Xm = 0, X2Xm = 0, &c.\nWhence we have,\nt1t2 = 0, t1tm = 0, &c.\nUnder these circumstances it may easily be shown, that the developed logical\nvalue of x1 will be\nx1 = 0\n0 (\u00aft1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm + t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm . . . + tm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121)\n+ constitutents whose coefficients are 1\n0 .\nIn the above equation \u00aft1 stands for 1 \u2212 t1, &c.\nThese investigations are equally applicable to the case in which the probabilities\nof the verdicts of a jury, so far as agreement and disagreement of opinion are\nconcerned, form the data of a problem. Let the logical symbol w denote that\nevent or state of things which consists in the guilt of the accused person.\nThen the functions X1, X2 . . . Xm of the present problem are such, that no\nchange would therein ensue from simultaneously converting w, x1, x2 . . . xn into\n\u00afw, \u00afx1, \u00afx2, . . . \u00afxn respectively. Hence the final logical value of w, as well as those\nof x1, x2, . . . xn will be exhibited under the same form (3), and a like general\nconclusion thence deduced.\nIt is therefore established, that from mere statistical documents nothing can\nbe inferred respecting either the individual correctness of opinion of a judge or\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 302\ncounsellor, the guilt of an individual, or the merits of a disputed question. If the\ndetermination of such elements as the above can be reduced within the province\nof science at all, it must be by virtue either of some assumed criterion of truth\nfurnishing us with new data, or of some hypothesis relative to the connexion or\nthe independence of individual judgments, which may warrant a new form of\nthe investigation. In the examination of the results of different hypotheses, the\nfollowing general Proposition will be of importance.\nProposition II.\n8. Given the probabilities of the n simple events x1, x2, . . . xn, viz.:\u2014\nProb. x1 = c1, Prob. x2 = c2, . . . Prob. xn = cn; (1)\nalso the probabilities of the m \u2212 1 compound events X1, X2, . . . Xm\u22121, viz.:\u2014\nProb. X1 = a1, Prob. X2 = a2, . . . Prob. Xm\u22121 = am\u22121; (2)\nthe latter events X1 . . . Xm\u22121 being distinct and mutually exclusive; required the\nprobability of any other compound event X.\nIn this proposition it is supposed, that X1, X2, . . . Xm\u22121, as well as\nX, are functions of the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn alone. Moreover, the events\nX1, X2, . . . Xm\u22121 being mutually exclusive, we have\nX1X2 = 0, . . . X1Xm\u22121 = 0, X2X3 = 0, &c.; (3)\nthe product of any two members of the system vanishing. Now assume\nX1 = t1, Xm\u22121 = tm\u22121, X = t. (4)\nThen t must be determined as a logical function of x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tm\u22121.\nNow by (3),\nt1t2 = 0, t1tm\u22121 = 0, t2t3 = 0, &c.; (5)\nall binary products of t1, . . . \u00aftm\u22121, vanishing. The developed expression for t\ncan, therefore, only involve in the list of constituents which have 1, 0, or 0\n0 for\ntheir coefficients, such as contain some one of the following factors, viz.:\u2014\n\u00aft1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121, t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121, . . . \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22122tm\u22121; (6)\n\u00aft1 standing for 1 \u2212 t1, &c. It remains to assign that portion of each constituent\nwhich involves the symbols x1 . . . xn; together with the corresponding coefficients.\nSince Xi = ti (i being any integer between 1 and m \u2212 1 inclusive), it is\nevident that\nXi\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 = 0,\nfrom the very constitution of the functions. Any constituent included in the\nfirst member of the above equation would, therefore, have 1\n0 for its coefficient.\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 303\nNow let\nXm = 1 \u2212 X1 . . . \u2212 Xm\u22121; (7)\nand it is evident that such constituents as involve \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121, as a factor, and\nyet have coefficients of the form 1, 0, or 0\n0 , must be included in the expression\nXm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121.\nNow Xm may be resolved into two portions, viz., X Xm and (1 \u2212 X)Xm, the\nformer being the sum of those constituents of Xm which are found in X, the\nlatter of those which are not found in X. It is evident that in the developed\nexpression of t, which is equivalent to X, the coefficients of the constituents in\nthe former portion X Xm will be 1, while those of the latter portion (1 \u2212 X)Xm\nwill be 0. Hence the elements we have now considered will contribute to the\ndevelopment of t the terms\nXXm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + 0(1 \u2212 X)Xm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121.\nAgain, since X1 = t1, while X2t1 = t2t1 = 0, &c., it is evident that the only\nconstituents involving t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121, as a factor which have coefficients of the\nform 1, 0, or 0\n0 , will be included in the expression\nX1t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121;\nand reasoning as before, we see that this will contribute to the development of\nt the terms\nXX1t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + 0(1 \u2212 X)X1t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121.\nProceeding thus with the remaining terms of (6), we deduce for the final\nexpression of t,\nt = XXm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + XX1t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 . . . + XXm\u22121\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22122tm\u22121\n+0(1 \u2212 X)Xm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + 0(1 \u2212 X)X1t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + &c. (8)\n+terms whose coefficients are 1\n0 .\nIn this expression it is to be noted that X Xm denotes the sum of those\nconstituents which are common to X and Xm, that sum being actually given\nby multiply ing X and Xm together, according to the rules of the calculus of\nLogic.\nIn passing from Logic to Algebra, we shall represent by (X Xm) what the\nabove product becomes, when, after effecting the multiplication, or selecting the\ncommon constituents, we give to the symbols x1, . . . xn, a quantitative meaning.\nWith this understanding we shall have, by the general Rule (XVII. 17),\nProb. t\n= (XXm)\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + (XX1)t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + (XXm\u22121)\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22122tm\u22121\nV , (9)\nV = Xm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + X1t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 . . . + Xm\u22121\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22122tm\u22121 (10)\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 304\nwhence the relations determining x1, . . . xn, t1, . . . tm\u22121 will be of the following\ntype (i varying from 1 to n),\n(xiXm)\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + (xiX1)t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + (xiXm\u22121)\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22122tm\u22121\nci\n= X1t1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121\na1\n. . . = Xm\u22121\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22122tm\u22121\nam\u22121\n= V. (11)\nFrom the above system we shall next eliminate the symbols t1, . . . tm\u22121.\nWe have\nt1\u00aft2 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 = a1V\nX1\n, \u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22122tm\u22121 = am\u22121V\nXm\u22121\n. (12)\nSubstituting these values in (10), we find\nV = Xm\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 + a1V . . . + am\u22121V.\nHence,\n\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 = (1 \u2212 a1 . . . \u2212 am\u22121)V\nXm\n.\nNow let\nam = 1 \u2212 a1 . . . \u2212 am\u22121, (13)\nthen we have\n\u00aft1 . . . \u00aftm\u22121 = amV\nXm\n. (14)\nNow reducing, by means of (12) and (14), the equation (9), and the equation\nformed by equating the first line of (11) to the symbol V ; writing also Prob. X\nfor Prob. t, we have\nProb. X = a1(XX1)\nX1\n+ a2(XX2)\nX2\n. . . + am(XXm)\nXm\n, (15)\na1(xiX1)\nX1\n+ a2(xiX2)\nX2\n. . . + am(xiXm)\nXm\n= ci; (16)\nwherein Xm and am are given by (7) and (13). These equations involve the\ndirect solution of the problem under consideration. In (16) we have the type\nof n equations (formed by giving to i the values 1, 2, . . . n successively), from\nwhich the values of x1, x2, . . . xn, will be found, and those values substituted in\n(15) give the value of Prob. X as a function of the constants a1, c1, &c.\nOne conclusion deserving of notice, which is deducible from the above\nsolution, is, that if the probabilities of the compound events X1, . . . Xm\u22121, are\nthe same as they would be were the events x1, . . . xn entirely independent, and\nwith given probabilities c1, . . . cn, then the probability of the event X will be the\nsame as if calculated upon the same hypothesis of the absolute independence\nof the events x1, . . . xn. For upon the hypothesis supposed, the assumption\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 305\nx1 = c1, xn = cn, in the quantitative system would give X1 = a1, Xm = am,\nwhence (15) and (16) would give\nProb. X = (XX1) + (XX2) . . . + (XXm), (17)\n(xiX1) + (xiX2) . . . + (xiXm) = ci. (18)\nBut since X1 + X2 . . . + Xm = 1, it is evident that the second member of\n(17) will be formed by taking all the constituents that are contained in X, and\ngiving them an algebraic significance. And a similar remark applies to (18).\nWhence those equations respectively give\nProb. X (logical) = X (algebraic),\nxi = ci.\nWherefore, if X = \u03d5(x1, x2, . . . xn), we have\nProb. X = \u03d5(c1, c2, . . . cn),\nwhich is the result in question.\nHence too it would follow, that if the quantities c1, . . . cn were indeterminate,\nand no hypothesis were made as to the possession of a mean common value, the\nsystem (15) (16) would be satisfied by giving to those quantities any such values,\nx1, x2, . . . xn, as would satisfy the equations\nX1 = a1 . . . Xm\u22121 = am\u22121, X = a,\nsupposing the value of the element a, like the values of a1, . . . am\u22121, to be given\nby experience. 9. Before applying the general solution (15) (16), to the question\nof the probability of judgments, it will be convenient to make the following\ntransformation. Let the data be\nx1 = c1 . . . xn = cn,\nProb. X1 = a1 . . . Prob. Xm\u22122 = am\u22122;\nand let it be required to determine Prob. Xm\u22121, the unknown value of which\nwe will represent by am\u22121. Then in (15) and (16) we must change\nX into Xm\u22121, Prob. X into am\u22121,\nXm\u22121 into Xm\u22122, am\u22121 into am\u22122,\nXm into Xm\u22121 + Xm, am into am\u22121 + am;\nwith these transformations, and observing that (Xm\u22121Xr ) = 0, except when\nr = m \u2212 1, and that it is then equal to Xm\u22121, the equations (15) (16) give\nam\u22121 = (am\u22121 + am)Xm\u22121\nXm\u22121 + Xm\n, (19)\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 306\na1(xiX1)\nX1\n. . . + am\u22122(xiXm\u22122)\nXm\u22122\n+ (am\u22121 + am)(xiXm\u22121 + xiXm\nXm\u22121 + Xm\n. (20)\nNow from (19) we find\nXm\u22121\nam\u22121\n= Xm\nam\n= Xm\u22121 + Xm\nam\u22121 + am\n,\nby virtue of which the last term of (20) may be reduced to the form\nam\u22121(xiXm\u22121)\nXm\u22121\n+ am(xiXm)\nXm\n.\nWith these reductions the system (17) and (18) may be replaced by the following\nsymmetrical one, viz.: Xm\u22121\nam\u22121\n= Xm\nam\n, (21)\na1(xiX1)\nX1\n+ a2(xiX2)\nX2\n. . . + am(xiXm)\nXm\n= ci. (22)\nThese equations, in connexion with (7) and (13), enable us to determine am\u22121, as\na function of c1 . . . cn, a1 . . . am\u22122, the numerical data supposed to be furnished\nby experience. We now proceed to their application.\nProposition III.\n10. Given any system of probabilities drawn from recorded instances of\nunanimity, or of assigned numerical majority in the decisions of a deliberative\nassembly; required, upon a certain determinate hypothesis, the mean probability\nof correct judgment for a member of the assembly.\nIn what way the probabilities of unanimous decision and of specific numerical\nmajorities may be determined from experience, has been intimated in a former\npart of this chapter. Adopting the notation of Prop. i. we shall represent\nthe events whose probabilities are given by the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm\u22121. It\nhas appeared from the very nature of the case that these events are mutually\nexclusive, and that the functions by which they are represented are symmetrical\nwith reference to the symbols x1, x2, . . . xn. Those symbols we continue to use in\nthe same sense as in Prop. i., viz., by xi we understand that event which consists\nin the formation of a correct opinion by the ith member of the assembly.\nNow the immediate data of experience are\u2014\nProb. X1 = a1, Prob. X2 = a2 . . . Prob. Xm\u22122 = am\u22122, (1)\nProb. Xm\u22121 = am\u22121. (2)\nX1 . . . Xm\u22121 being functions of the logical symbols x1, . . . xn to the probabilities\nof the events denoted by which, we shall assign the indeterminate value c. Thus\nwe shall have\nProb. x1 = Prob. x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = Prob. xn = c. (3)\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 307\nNow it has been seen, Prop. i., that the immediate data (1) (2), unassisted\nby any hypothesis, merely conduct us to a restatement of the problem. On\nthe other hand, it is manifest that if, adopting the methods of Laplace and\nPoisson, we employ the system (3) alone as the data for the application\nof the method of this work, finally comparing the results obtained with the\nexperimental system (1) (2), we are relying wholly upon a doubtful hypothesis,\u2014\nthe independence of individual judgments. But though we ought not wholly\nto rely upon this hypothesis, we cannot wholly dispense with it, or with some\nequivalent substitute. Let us then examine the consequences of a limited\nindependence of the individual judgments; the conditions of limitation being\nfurnished by the apparently superfluous data. From the system (1) (3) let us,\nby the method of this work, determine Prob. Xm\u22121, and, comparing the result\nwith (2), determine c. Even here an arbitrary power of selection is claimed.\nBut it is manifest from Prop. i. that something of this kind is unavoidable, if\nwe would obtain a definite solution at all. As to the principle of selection, I\napprehend that the equation (2) reserved for final comparison should be that\nwhich, from the magnitude of its numerical element am\u22121, is esteemed the most\nimportant of the primary series furnished by experience.\nNow, from the mutually exclusive character of the events denoted by the\nfunctions X1, X2, . . . Xm\u22121, the concluding equations of the previous proposition\nbecome applicable. On account of the symmetry of the same functions, and the\nreduction of the system of values denoted by ci, to a single value c, the equations\nrepresented by (22) become identical, the values of x1, x2, . . . xn become equal,\nand may be replaced by a single value x, and we have simply,\nXm\u22121\nam\u22121\n= Xm\nam\n, (4)\na1(xX1)\nX1\n+ a2(xX2)\nX2\n. . . + am(xXm)\nXm\n= c. (5)\nThe following is the nature of the solution thus indicated:\nThe functions X1, . . . Xm\u22121, and the values a1, . . . am\u22121, being given in the\ndata, we have first,\nXm = 1 \u2212 X1 . . . \u2212 Xm\u22121,\nam = 1 \u2212 a1 . . . \u2212 am\u22121.\nFrom each of the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm thus given or determined, we\nmust select those constituents which contain a particular symbol, as x1 for a\nfactor. This will determine the functions (xX1), (xX2), &c., and then in all\nthe functions we must change x1, x2, . . . xn individually to x. Or we may regard\nany algebraic function Xi in the system (4) (5) as expressing the probability of\nthe event denoted by the logical function Xi, on the supposition that the logical\nsymbols x1, x2, . . . xn denote independent events whose common probability is x.\nOn the same supposition (xXi) would denote the probability of the concurrence\nof any particular event of the series x1, x2, . . . xn with Xi. The forms of Xi,\n(xXi), &c. being determined, the equation (4) gives the value of x, and this,\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 308\nsubstituted in (5), determines the value of the element c required. Of the two\nvalues which its solution will offer, one being greater, and the other less, than\n1\n2 , the greater one must be chosen, whensoever, upon general considerations, it\nis thought more probable that a member of the assembly will judge correctly,\nthan that he will judge incorrectly.\nHere then, upon the assumed principle that the largest of the values am\u22121\nshall be reserved for final comparison in the equation (2), we possess a definite\nsolution of the problem proposed. And the same form of solution remains\napplicable should any other equation of the system, upon any other ground,\nas that of superior accuracy, be similarly reserved in the place of (2).\n11. Let us examine to what extent the above reservation has influenced the\nfinal solution. It is evident that the equation (5) is quite independent of the\nchoice in question. So is likewise the second member of (4). Had we reserved the\nfunction X1, instead of Xm\u22121, the equation for the determination of x would\nhave been X1\na1\n= Xm\nam\n, (6)\nbut the value of x thence determined would still have to be substituted in the\nsame final equation (5). We know that were the events x1, x2, . . . xn really\nindependent, the equations (4), (6), and all others of which they are types,\nwould prove equivalent, and that the value of x furnished by any one of them\nwould be the true value of c. This affords a means of verifying (5). For if that\nequation be correct, it ought, under the above circumstances, to be satisfied by\nthe assumption c = x. In other words, the equation\na1(xX1)\nX1\n+ a2(xX2)\nX2\n. . . + am(xXm)\nXm\n= x (7)\nought, on solution, to give the same value of x as the equation (4) or (6). Now\nthis will be the case. For since, by hypothesis,\nX1\na1\n= X2\na2\n. . . = Xm\nam\n,\nwe have, by a known theorem,\nX1\na1\n= X2\na2\n. . . = Xm\nam\n= X1 + X2 . . . + Xm\na1 + a2 . . . + am\n= 1.\nHence (7) becomes on substituting a1 for X1, &c.\n(xX1) + (xX2) . . . (xXm) = x\na mere identity.\nWhenever, therefore, the events x1, x2, . . . xn are really independent, the\nsystem (4) (5) is a correct one, and is independent of the arbitrariness of the\nfirst step of the process by which it was obtained. When the said events are not\nindependent, the final system of equations will possess, leaving in abeyance the\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 309\nprinciple of selection above stated, an arbitrary element. But from the persistent\nform of the equation (5) it may be inferred that the solution is arbitrary in a less\ndegree than the solutions to which the hypothesis of the absolute independence\nof the individual judgments would conduct us. The discussion of the limits of\nthe value of c, as dependent upon the limits of the value of x, would determine\nsuch points.\nThese considerations suggest to us the question whether the equation (7),\nwhich is symmetrical with reference to the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm, free from\nany arbitrary elements, and rigorously exact when the events x1, x2, . . . xn are\nreally independent, might not be accepted as a mean general solution of the\nproblem. The proper mode of determining this point would, I conceive, be\nto ascertain whether the value of x which it would afford would, in general,\nfall within the limits of the value of c, as determined by the systems of\nequations of which the system (4), (5), presents the type. It seems probable\nthat under ordinary circumstances this would be the case. Independently of\nsuch considerations, however, we may regard (7) as itself the expression of a\ncertain principle of solution, viz., that regarding X1, X2, . . . Xm as exclusive\ncauses of the event whose probability is x, we accept the probabilities of those\ncauses a1, a2, . . . am from experience, but form the conditional probabilities of\nthe event as dependent upon such causes,\n(xX1)\nx1\n, (xX2)\nX2\n, &c. (XVII. Prop i.)\non the hypothesis of the independence of individual judgments, and so deduce\nthe equation (7). I conceive this, however, to be a less rigorous, though possibly,\nin practice a more convenient mode of procedure than that adopted in the\ngeneral solution.\n12. It now only remains to assign the particular forms which the algebraic\nfunctions Xi, (xXi), &c. in the above equations assume when the logical\nfunction Xi represents that event which consists in r members of the assembly\nvoting one way, and n \u2212 r members the other way. It is evident that in this\ncase the algebraic function Xi expresses what the probability of the supposed\nevent would be were the events x1, x2, . . . xn independent, and their common\nprobability measured by x. Hence we should have, by Art. 3,\nXi = n(n \u2212 1) . . . (n \u2212 r + 1)\n1 \u0005 2 . . . r {xr + (1 \u2212 x)n\u2212r }.\nUnder the same circumstances (xXi) would represent the probability of the\ncompound event, which consists in a particular member of the assembly forming\na correct judgment, conjointly with the general state of voting recorded above.\nIt would, therefore, be the probability that a particular member votes correctly,\nwhile of the remaining n \u2212 1 members, r \u2212 1 vote correctly; or that the same\nmember votes correctly, while of the remaining n\u22121 members r vote incorrectly.\nHence\n(xXi) = (n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2) . . . (n \u2212 r + 1)\n1 \u0005 2 . . . r \u2212 1 xr + (n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2) . . . (n \u2212 r)\n1 \u0005 2 . . . r xn\u2212r .\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 310\nProposition IV.\n13. Given any system of probabilities drawn from recorded instances of\nunanimity, or of assigned numerical majority in the decisions of a criminal\ncourt of justice, required upon hypotheses similar to those of the last proposition,\nthe mean probability c of correct judgment for a member of the court, and the\ngeneral probability k of guilt in an accused person.\nThe solution of this problem differs in but a slight degree from that of the\nlast, and may be referred to the same general formul\u00e6, (4) and (5), or (7). It is\nto be observed, that as there are two elements, c and k, to be determined, it is\nnecessary to reserve two of the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm\u22121, let us suppose X1,\nand Xm\u22121, for final comparison, employing either the remaining m\u22123 functions\nin the expression of the data, or the two respective sets X2, X3, . . . Xm\u22121, and\nX1, X2, . . . Xm\u22122. In either case it is supposed that there must be at least two\noriginal independent data. If the equation (7) be alone employed, it would in\nthe present instance furnish two equations, which may thus be written:\na1(xX1)\nX1\n+ a2(xX2)\nX2\n. . . + am(xXm)\nXm\n= x, (1)\na1(kX1)\nX1\n+ a2(kX2)\nX2\n. . . + am(kXm)\nXm\n= k. (2)\nThese equations are to be employed in the following manner:\u2014 Let x1, x2, . . . xn\nrepresent those events which consist in the formation of a correct opinion by\nthe members of the court respectively. Let also w represent that event which\nconsists in the guilt of the accused member. By the aid of these symbols we can\nlogically express the functions X1, X2, . . . Xm\u22121, whose probabilities are given,\nas also the function Xm. Then from the function X1 select those constituents\nwhich contain, as a factor, any particular symbol of the set x1, x2, . . . xn, and\nalso those constituents which contain as a factor w. In both results change\nx1, x2, . . . xn severally into x, and w into k. The above results will give (xX1)\nand (kX1). Effecting the same transformations throughout, the system (1), (2)\nwill, upon the particular hypothesis involved, determine x and k.\n14. We may collect from the above investigations the following facts and\nconclusions:\n1st. That from the mere records of agreement and disagreement in the\nopinions of any body of men, no definite numerical conclusions can be drawn\nrespecting either the probability of correct judgment in an individual member\nof the body, or the merit of the questions submitted to its consideration.\n2nd. That such conclusions may be drawn upon various distinct hypotheses,\nas\u20141st, Upon the usual hypothesis of the absolute independence of individual\njudgments; 2ndly, upon certain definite modifications of that hypothesis\nwarranted by the actual data; 3rdly, upon a distinct principle of solution\nsuggested by the appearance of a common form in the solutions obtained by\nthe modifications above adverted to.\nLastly. That whatever of doubt may attach to the final results, rests\nnot upon the imperfection of the method, which adapts itself equally to all\nCHAPTER XXI. PROBABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS 311\nhypotheses, but upon the uncertainty of the hypotheses themselves.\nIt seems, however, probable that with even the widest limits of hypothesis,\nconsistent with the taking into account of all the data of experience, the\ndeviation of the results obtained would be but slight, and that their mean\nvalues might be determined with great confidence by the methods of Prop. iii.\nOf those methods I should be disposed to give the preference to the first. Such a\nprinciple of mean solution having been agreed upon, other considerations seem\nto indicate that the values of c and k for tribunals and assemblies possessing\na definite constitution, and governed in their deliberations by fixed rules,\nwould remain nearly constant, subject, however, to a small secular variation,\ndependent upon the progress of knowledge and of justice among mankind.\nThere exist at present few, if any, data proper for their determination.\nChapter XXII\nON THE NATURE OF SCIENCE, AND THE\nCONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT.\n1. What I mean by the constitution of a system is the aggregate of those\ncauses and tendencies which produce its observed character, when operating,\nwithout interference, under those conditions to which the system is conceived\nto be adapted. Our judgment of such adaptation must be founded upon a study\nof the circumstances in which the system attains its freest action, produces its\nmost harmonious results, or fulfils in some other way the apparent design of its\nconstruction. There are cases in which we know distinctly the causes upon which\nthe operation of a system depends, as well as its conditions and its end. This is\nthe most perfect kind of knowledge relatively to the subject under consideration.\nThere are also cases in which we know only imperfectly or partially the causes\nwhich are at work, but are able, nevertheless, to determine to some extent the\nlaws of their action, and, beyond this, to discover general tendencies, and to\ninfer ulterior purpose. It has thus, I think rightly, been concluded that there\nis a moral faculty in our nature, not because we can understand the special\ninstruments by which it works, as we connect the organ with the faculty of\nsight, nor upon the ground that men agree in the adoption of universal rules\nof conduct; but because while, in some form or other, the sentiment of moral\napprobation or disapprobation manifests itself in all, it tends, wherever human\nprogress is observable, wherever society is not either stationary or hastening to\ndecay, to attach itself to certain classes of actions, consentaneously, and after a\nmanner indicative both of permanency and of law. Always and everywhere the\nmanifestation of Order affords a presumption, not measurable indeed, but real\n(XX. 22), of the fulfilment of an end or purpose, and the existence of a ground\nof orderly causation.\n2. The particular question of the constitution of the intellect has, it is\nalmost needless to say, attracted the efforts of speculative ingenuity in every\nage. For it not only addresses itself to that desire of knowledge which the\ngreatest masters of ancient thought believed to be innate in our species, but\nit adds to the ordinary strength of this motive the inducement of a human\nand personal interest. A genuine devotion to truth is, indeed, seldom partial\nin its aims, but while it prompts to expatiate over the fair fields of outward\n312\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 313\nobservation, forbids to neglect the study of our own faculties. Even in ages the\nmost devoted to material interests, some portion of the current of thought has\nbeen reflected inwards, and the desire to comprehend that by which all else is\ncomprehended has only been baffled in order to be renewed.\nIt is probable that this pertinacity of effort would not have been maintained\namong sincere inquirers after truth, had the conviction been general that such\nspeculations are hopelessly barren. We may conceive that it has been felt that\nif something of error and uncertainty, always incidental to a state of partial\ninformation, must ever be attached to the results of such inquiries, a residue of\npositive knowledge may yet remain; that the contradictions which are met with\nare more often verbal than real; above all, that even probable conclusions derive\nhere an interest and a value from their subject, which render them not unworthy\nto claim regard beside the more definite and more splendid results of physical\nscience. Such considerations seem to be perfectly legitimate. Insoluble as many\nof the problems connected with the inquiry into the nature and constitution of\nthe mind must be presumed to be, there are not wanting others upon which\na limited but not doubtful knowledge, others upon which the conclusions of a\nhighly probable analogy, are attainable. As the realms of day and night are not\nstrictly conterminous, but are separated by a crepuscular zone, through which\nthe light of the one fades gradually off into the darkness of the other, so it may\nbe said that every region of positive knowledge lies surrounded by a debateable\nand speculative territory, over which it in some degree extends its influence\nand its light. Thus there may be questions relating to the constitution of the\nintellect which, though they do not admit, in the present state of knowledge, of\nan absolute decision, may receive so much of reflected information as to render\ntheir probable solution not difficult; and there may also be questions relating\nto the nature of science, and even to particular truths and doctrines of science,\nupon which they who accept the general principles of this work cannot but be\nled to entertain positive opinions, differing, it may be, from those which are\nusually received in the present day.1 In what follows I shall recapitulate some\nof the more definite conclusions established in the former parts of this treatise,\nand shall then indicate one or two trains of thought, connected with the general\nobjects above adverted to, which they seem to me calculated to suggest.\n3. Among those conclusions, relating to the intellectual constitution, which\nmay be considered as belonging to the realm of positive knowledge, we may\nreckon the scientific laws of thought and reasoning, which have formed the basis\nof the general methods of this treatise, together with the principles, Chap, v., by\nwhich their application has been determined. The resolution of the domain of\nthought into two spheres, distinct but coexistent (IV. XI.); the subjection of the\n1The following illustration may suffice:\u2013\nIt is maintained by some of the highest modern authorities in grammar that conjunctions\nconnect propositions only. Now, without inquiring directly whether this opinion is sound or\nnot, it is obvious that it cannot consistently be held by any who admit the scientific principles\nof this treatise; for to such it would seem to involve a denial, either, 1st, of the possibility of\nperforming, or 2ndly, of the possibility of expressinq, a mental operation, the laws of which,\nviewed in both these relations, have been investigated and applied in the present work\u2014\n(Latham on the English Language; Sir John Stoddart\u2019s Universal Grammar, &c.)\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 314\nintellectual operations within those spheres to a common system of laws (XI.);\nthe general mathematical character of those laws, and their actual expression\n(II. III.); the extent of their affinity with the laws of thought in the domain of\nnumber, and the point of their divergence therefrom; the dominant character\nof the two limiting conceptions of universe and eternity among all the subjects\nof thought with which Logic is concerned; the relation of those conceptions to\nthe fundamental conception of unity in the science of number,\u2014 these, with\nmany similar results, are not to be ranked as merely probable or analogical\nconclusions, but are entitled to be regarded as truths of science. Whether they\nbe termed metaphysical or not, is a matter of indifference. The nature of the\nevidence upon which they rest, though in kind distinct, is not inferior in value to\nany which can be adduced in support of the general truths of physical science.\nAgain, it is agreed that there is a certain order observable in the progress\nof all the exacter forms of knowledge. The study of every department of\nphysical science begins with observation, it advances by the collation of facts\nto a presumptive acquaintance with their connecting law, the validity of such\npresumption it tests by new experiments so devised as to augment, if the\npresumption be well founded, its probability indefinitely; and finally, the\nlaw of the ph\u00e6nomenon having been with sufficient confidence determined,\nthe investigation of causes, conducted by the due mixture of hypothesis and\ndeduction, crowns the inquiry. In this advancing order of knowledge, the\nparticular faculties and laws whose nature has been considered in this work\nbear their part. It is evident, therefore, that if we would impartially investigate\neither the nature of science, or the intellectual constitution in its relation\nto science, no part of the two series above presented ought to be regarded\nas isolated. More especially ought those truths which stand in any kind of\nsupplemental relation to each other to be considered in their mutual bearing\nand connexion.\n4. Thus the necessity of an experimental basis for all positive knowledge,\nviewed in connexion with the existence and the peculiar character of that system\nof mental laws, and principles, and operations, to which attention has been\ndirected, tends to throw light upon some important questions by which the\nworld of speculative thought is still in a great measure divided. How, from\nthe particular facts which experience presents, do we arrive at the general\npropositions of science? What is the nature of these propositions? Are they\nsolely the collections of experience, or does the mind supply some connecting\nprinciple of its own? In a word, what is the nature of scientific truth, and what\nare the grounds of that confidence with which it claims to be received?\nThat to such questions as the above, no single and general answer can\nbe given, must be evident. There are cases in which they do not even need\ndiscussion. Instances are familiar, in which general propositions merely express\nper enumerationem simplicem, a fact established by actual observation in all\nthe cases to which the proposition applies. The astronomer asserts upon this\nground, that all the known planets move from west to east round the sun. But\nthere are also cases in which general propositions are assumed from observation\nof their truth in particular instances, and extension of that truth to instances\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 315\nunobserved. No principle of merely deductive reasoning can warrant such a\nprocedure. When from a large number of observations on the planet Mars,\nKepler inferred that it revolved in an ellipse, the conclusion was larger than\nhis premises, or indeed than any premises which mere observation could give.\nWhat other element, then, is necessary to give even a prospective validity to\nsuch generalizations as this? It is the ability inherent in our nature to appreciate\nOrder, and the concurrent presumption, however founded, that the ph\u00e6nomena\nof Nature are connected by a principle of Order. Without these, the general\ntruths of physical science could never have been ascertained. Grant that the\nprocedure thus established can only conduct us to probable or to approximate\nresults; it only follows, that the larger number of the generalizations of physical\nscience possess but a probable or approximate truth. The security of the\ntenure of knowledge consists in this, that wheresoever such conclusions do truly\nrepresent the constitution of Nature, our confidence in their truth receives\nindefinite confirmation, and soon becomes undistinguishable from certainty.\nThe existence of that principle above represented as the basis of inductive\nreasoning enables us to solve the much disputed question as to the necessity\nof general propositions in reasoning. The logician affirms, that it is impossible\nto deduce any conclusion from particular premises. Modern writers of high\nrepute have contended, that all reasoning is from particular to particular truths.\nThey instance, that in concluding from the possession of a property by certain\nmembers of a class, its possession by some other member, it is not necessary\nto establish the intermediate general conclusion which affirms its possession\nby all the members of the class in common. Now whether it is so or not,\nthat principle of order or analogy upon which the reasoning is conducted must\neither be stated or apprehended as a general truth, to give validity to the final\nconclusion. In this form, at least, the necessity of general propositions as the\nbasis of inference is confirmed,\u2014a necessity which, however, I conceive to be\ninvolved in the very existence, and still more in the peculiar nature, of those\nfaculties whose laws have been investigated in this work. For if the process of\nreasoning be carefully analyzed, it will appear that abstraction is made of all\npeculiarities of the individual to which the conclusion refers, and the attention\nconfined to those properties by which its membership of the class is defined.\n5. But besides the general propositions which are derived by induction from\nthe collated facts of experience, there exist others belonging to the domain of\nwhat is termed necessary truth. Such are the general propositions of Arithmetic,\nas well as the propositions expressing the laws of thought upon which the general\nmethods of this treatise are founded; and these propositions are not only capable\nof being rigorously verified in particular instances, but are made manifest in all\ntheir generality from the study of particular instances. Again, there exist general\npropositions expressive of necessary truths, but incapable, from the imperfection\nof the senses, of being exactly verified. Some, if not all, of the propositions of\nGeometry are of this nature; but it is not in the region of Geometry alone\nthat such propositions are found. The question concerning their nature and\norigin is a very ancient one, and as it is more intimately connected with the\ninquiry into the constitution of the intellect than any other to which allusion\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 316\nhas been made, it will not be irrelevant to consider it here. Among the opinions\nwhich have most widely prevailed upon the subject are the following. It has\nbeen maintained, that propositions of the class referred to exist in the mind\nindependently of experience, and that those conceptions which are the subjects\nof them are the imprints of eternal archetypes. With such archetypes, conceived,\nhowever, to possess a reality of which all the objects of sense are but a faint\nshadow or dim suggestion, Plato furnished his ideal world. It has, on the other\nhand, been variously contended, that the subjects of such propositions are copies\nof individual objects of experience; that they are mere names; that they are\nindividual objects of experience themselves; and that the propositions which\nrelate to them are, on account of the imperfection of those objects, but partially\ntrue; lastly, that they are intellectual products formed by abstraction from the\nsensible perceptions of individual things, but so formed as to become, what\nthe individual things never can be, subjects of science, i.e. subjects concerning\nwhich exact and general propositions may be affirmed. And there exist, perhaps,\nyet other views, in some of which the sensible, in others the intellectual or ideal,\nelement predominates.\nNow if the last of the views above adverted to be taken (for it is not proposed\nto consider either the purely ideal or the purely nominalist view) and if it be\ninquired what, in the sense above stated, are the proper objects of science,\nobjects in relation to which its propositions are true without any mixture of\nerror, it is conceived that but one answer can be given. It is, that neither\ndo individual objects of experience, nor with all probability do the mental\nimages which they suggest, possess any strict claim to this title. It seems to be\ncertain, that neither in nature nor in art do we meet with anything absolutely\nagreeing with the geometrical definition of a straight line, or of a triangle, or of\na circle, though the deviation therefrom may be inappreciable by sense; and it\nmay be conceived as at least doubtful, whether we can form a perfect mental\nimage, or conception, with which the agreement shall be more exact. But it is\nnot doubtful that such conceptions, however imperfect, do point to something\nbeyond themselves, in the gradual approach towards which all imperfection\ntends to disappear. Although the perfect triangle, or square, or circle, exists not\nin nature, eludes all our powers of representative conception, and is presented\nto us in thought only, as the limit of an indefinite process of abstraction, yet,\nby a wonderful faculty of the understanding, it may be made the subject of\npropositions which are absolutely true. The domain of reason is thus revealed\nto us as larger than that of imagination. Should any, indeed, think that we are\nable to picture to ourselves, with rigid accuracy, the scientific elements of form,\ndirection, magnitude, &c., these things, as actually conceived, will, in the view\nof such persons, be the proper objects of science. But if, as seems to me the more\njust opinion, an incurable imperfection attaches to all our attempts to realize\nwith precision these elements, then we can only affirm, that the more external\nobjects do approach in reality, or the conceptions of fancy by abstraction, to\ncertain limiting states, never, it may be, actually attained, the more do the\ngeneral propositions of science concerning those things or conceptions approach\nto absolute truth, the actual deviation therefrom tending to disappear. To some\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 317\nextent, the same observations are applicable also to the physical sciences. What\nhave been termed the \u201cfundamental ideas\u201d of those sciences as force, polarity,\ncrystallization, &c.,2are neither, as I conceive, intellectual products independent\nof experience, nor mere copies of external things; but while, on the one hand,\nthey have a necessary antecedent in experience, on the other hand they require\nfor their formation the exercise of the power of abstraction, in obedience to\nsome general faculty or disposition of our nature, which ever prompts us to\nthe research, and qualifies us for the appreciation, of order.3Thus we study\napproximately the effects of gravitation on the motions of the heavenly bodies,\nby a reference to the limiting supposition, that the planets are perfect spheres\nor spheroids. We determine approximately the path of a ray of light through the\natmosphere, by a process in which abstraction is made of all disturbing influences\nof temperature. And such is the order of procedure in all the higher walks of\nhuman knowledge. Now what is remarkable in connexion with these processes of\nthe intellect is the disposition, and the corresponding ability, to ascend from the\nimperfect representations of sense and the diversities of individual experience,\nto the perception of general, and it may be of immutable truths. Whereever\nthis disposition and this ability unite, each series of connected facts in nature\nmay furnish the intimations of an order more exact than that which it directly\nmanifests. For it may serve as ground and occasion for the exercise of those\npowers, whose office it is to apprehend the general truths which are indeed\nexemplified, but never with perfect fidelity, in a world of changeful ph\u00e6nomena.\n6. The truth that the ultimate laws of thought are mathematical in their\nform, viewed in connexion with the fact of the possibility of error, establishes\na ground for some remarkable conclusions. If we directed our attention to the\nscientific truth alone, we might be led to infer an almost exact parallelism\nbetween the intellectual operations and the movements of external nature.\nSuppose any one conversant with physical science, but unaccustomed to reflect\nupon the nature of his own faculties, to have been informed, that it had been\nproved, that the laws of those faculties were mathematical; it is probable\nthat after the first feelings of incredulity had subsided, the impression would\narise, that the order of thought must, therefore, be as necessary as that of the\nmaterial universe. We know that in the realm of natural science, the absolute\n2Whewell\u2019s Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, pp. 71, 77, 213.\n3Of the idea of order it has been profoundly said, that it carries within itself its own\njustification or its own control, the very trustworthiness of our faculties being judged by the\nconformity of their results to an order which satisfies the reason. \u201cL\u2019id\u00b4ee de l\u2019ordre a cela\nde singulier et d\u2019eminent, qu\u2019elle porte en elle m\u02c6eme sa justification ou son contr\u02c6ole. Pour\ntrouver si nos autres facult\u00b4es nous trompent ou nous ne trompent pas, nous examinons si\nles notions qu\u2019elles nous donnent s\u2019encha\u02c6\u0131nent on ne s\u2019encha\u02c6\u0131nent pas suivant un ordre qui\nsatisfasse la raison.\u201d\u2014Cournot, Essai sur les fondements de nos Connaissances. Admitting\nthis principle as the guide of those powers of abstraction which we undoubtedly possess, it\nseems unphilosophical to assume that the fundamental ideas of the sciences are not derivable\nfrom experience. Doubtless the capacities which have been given to us for the comprehension\nof the actual world would avail us in a differently constituted scene, if in some form or other\nthe dominion of order was still maintained. It is conceivable that in such a new theatre of\nspeculation, the laws of the intellectual procedure remaining the same, the fundamental ideas\nof the sciences might be wholly different from those with which we are at present acquainted.\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 318\nconnexion between the initial and final elements of a problem, exhibited in\nthe mathematical form, fitly symbolizes that physical necessity which binds\ntogether effect and cause. The necessary sequence of states and conditions in\nthe inorganic world, and the necessary connexion of premises and conclusion in\nthe processes of exact demonstration thereto applied, seem to be co-ordinate. It\nmay possibly be a question, to which of the two series the primary application\nof the term \u201cnecessary\u201d is due; whether to the observed constancy of Nature,\nor to the indissoluble connexion of propositions in all valid reasoning upon\nher works. Historically we should perhaps give the preference to the former,\nphilosophically to the latter view. But the fact of the connexion is indisputable,\nand the analogy to which it points is obvious.\nWere, then, the laws of valid reasoning uniformly obeyed, a very close\nparallelism would exist between the operations of the intellect and those of\nexternal Nature. Subjection to laws mathematical in their form and expression,\neven the subjection of an absolute obedience, would stamp upon the two series\none common character. The reign of necessity over the intellectual and the\nphysical world would be alike complete and universal.\nBut while the observation of external Nature testifies with ever-strengthening\nevidence to the fact, that uniformity of operation and unvarying obedience to\nappointed laws prevail throughout her entire domain, the slightest attention to\nthe processes of the intellectual world reveals to us another state of things.\nThe mathematical laws of reasoning are, properly speaking, the laws of\nright reasoning only, and their actual transgression is a perpetually recurring\nphenomenon. Error, which has no place in the material system, occupies a large\none here. We must accept this as one of those ultimate facts, the origin of which\nit lies beyond the province of science to determine. We must admit that there\nexist laws which even the rigour of their mathematical forms does not preserve\nfrom violation. We must ascribe to them an authority the essence of which does\nnot consist in power, a supremacy which the analogy of the inviolable order of\nthe natural world in no way assists us to comprehend.\nAs the distinction thus pointed out is real, it remains unaffected by any\npeculiarity in our views respecting other portions of the mental constitution. If\nwe regard the intellect as free, and this is apparently the view most in accordance\nwith the general spirit of these speculations, its freedom must be viewed as\nopposed to the dominion of necessity, not to the existence of a certain just\nsupremacy of truth. The laws of correct inference may be violated, but they\ndo not the less truly exist on this account. Equally do they remain unaffected\nin character and authority if the hypothesis of necessity in its extreme form be\nadopted. Let it be granted that the laws of valid reasoning, such as they are\ndetermined to be in this work, or, to speak more generally, such as they would\nfinally appear in the conclusions of an exhaustive analysis, form but a part of\nthe system of laws by which the actual processes of reasoning, whether right or\nwrong, are governed. Let it be granted that if that system were known to us in\nits completeness, we should perceive that the whole intellectual procedure was\nnecessary, even as the movements of the inorganic world are necessary. And let\nit finally, as a consequence of this hypothesis, be granted that the ph\u00e6nomena of\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 319\nincorrect reasoning or error, wheresoever presented, are due to the interference\nof other laws with those laws of which right reasoning is the product. Still it\nwould remain that there exist among the intellectual laws a number marked\nout from the rest by this special character, viz., that every movement of the\nintellectual system which is accomplished solely under their direction is right,\nthat every interference therewith by other laws is not interference only, but\nviolation. It cannot but be felt that this circumstance would give to the laws in\nquestion a character of distinction and of predominance. They would but the\nmore evidently seem to indicate a final purpose which is not always fulfilled, to\npossess an authority inherent and just, but not always commanding obedience.\nNow a little consideration will show that there is nothing analogous to this\nin the government of the world by natural law. The realm of inorganic Nature\nadmits neither of preference nor of distinctions. We cannot separate any portion\nof her laws from the rest, and pronounce them alone worthy of obedience,\u2014\nalone charged with the fulfilment of her highest purpose. On the contrary, all\nher laws seem to stand co-ordinate, and the larger our acquaintance with them,\nthe more necessary does their united action seem to the harmony and, so far\nas we can comprehend it, to the general design of the system. How often the\nmost signal departures from apparent order in the inorganic world, such as\nthe perturbations of the planetary system, the interruption of the process of\ncrystallization by the intrusion of a foreign force, and others of a like nature,\neither merge into the conception of some more exalted scheme of order, or lose\nto a more attentive and instructed gaze their abnormal aspect, it is needless\nto remark. One explanation only of these facts can be given, viz., that the\ndistinction between true and false, between correct and incorrect, exists in the\nprocesses of the intellect, but not in the region of a physical necessity. As we\nadvance from the lower stages of organic being to the higher grade of conscious\nintelligence, this contrast gradually dawns upon us. Wherever the ph\u00e6nomena\nof life are manifested, the dominion of rigid law in some degree yields to that\nmysterious principle of activity. Thus, although the structure of the animal\ntribes is conformable to certain general types, yet are those types sometimes,\nperhaps, in relation to the highest standards of beauty and proportion, always,\nimperfectly realized. The two alternatives, between which Art in the present\nday fluctuates, are the exact imitation of individual forms, and the endeavour,\nby abstraction from all such, to arrive at the conception of an ideal grace and\nexpression, never, it may be, perfectly manifested in forms of earthly mould.\nAgain, those teleological adaptations by which, without the organic type being\nsacrificed, species become fitted to new conditions or abodes, are but slowly\naccomplished,\u2014accomplished, however, not, apparently, by the fateful power of\nexternal circumstances, but by the calling forth of an energy from within. Life in\nall its forms may thus be contrasted with the passive fixity of inorganic nature.\nBut inasmuch as the perfection of the types in which it is corporeally manifested\nis in some measure of an ideal character, inasmuch as we cannot precisely define\nthe highest suggested excellency of form and of adaptation, the contrast is less\nmarked here than that which exists between the intellectual processes and those\nof the purely material world. For the definite and technical character of the\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 320\nmathematical laws by which both are governed, places in stronger light the\nfundamental difference between the kind of authority which, in their capacity\nof government, they respectively exercise.\n7. There is yet another instance connected with the general objects of this\nchapter, in which the collation of truths or facts, drawn from different sources,\nsuggests an instructive train of reflection. It consists in the comparison of the\nlaws of thought, in their scientific expression, with the actual forms which\nphysical speculation in early ages, and metaphysical speculation in all ages,\nhave tended to assume. There are two illustrations of this remark, to which, in\nparticular, I wish to direct attention here.\n1st. It has been shown (III. 13) that there is a scientific connexion between\nthe conceptions of unity in Number, and the universe in Logic. They occupy\nin their respective systems the same relative place, and are subject to the same\nformal laws. Now to the Greek mind, in that early stage of activity,\u2014a stage\nnot less marked, perhaps not less necessary, in the progression of the human\nintellect, than the era of Bacon or of Newton,\u2014when the great problems of\nNature began to unfold themselves, while the means of observation were as\nyet wanting, and its necessity not understood, the terms \u201cUniverse\u201d and \u201cThe\nOne\u201d seem to have been regarded as almost identical. To assign the nature\nof that unity of which all existence was thought to be a manifestation, was\nthe first aim of philosophy.4 Thales sought for this fundamental unity in water.\nAnaximenes and Diogenes conceived it to be air. Hippasus of Metapontum,\nand Heraclitus the Ephesian, pronounced that it was fire. Less definite or less\nconfident in his views, Parmenides simply declared that all existing things were\nOne; Melissus that the Universe was infinite, unsusceptible of change or motion,\nOne, like to itself, and that motion was not, but seemed to be.5 In a spirit which,\nto the reflective mind of Aristotle, appeared sober when contrasted with the\nrashness of previous speculation, Anaxagoras of Clazomen\u00e6, following, perhaps,\nthe steps of his fellow-citizen, Hermotimus, sought in Intelligence the cause of\nthe world and of its order.6 The pantheistic tendency which pervaded many of\nthese speculations is manifest in the language of Xenophanes, the founder of\nthe Eleatic school, who, \u201csurveying the expanse of heaven, declared that the\nOne was God.\u201d7 Perhaps there are few, if any, of the forms in which unity\ncan be conceived, in the abstract as numerical or rational, in the concrete as\na passive substance, or a central and living principle, of which we do not meet\nwith applications in these ancient doctrines.

CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 321\nlarger number of those who once addicted themselves to such speculations, it\nis probable that the very names have perished. Strange, but suggestive truth,\nthat while Nature in all but the aspect of the heavens must have appeared as\nlittle else than a scene of unexplained disorder, while the popular belief was\ndistracted amid the multiplicity of its gods, \u2014the conception of a primal unity,\nif only in a rude, material form, should have struck deepest root; surviving in\nmany a thoughtful breast the chills of a lifelong disappointment, and an endless\nsearch!8\n2ndly. In equally intimate alliance with that law of thought which is\nexpressed by an equation of the second degree, and which has been termed in this\ntreatise the law of duality, stands the tendency of ancient thought to those forms\nof philosophical speculation which are known under the name of dualism. The\ntheory of Empedocles,9 which explained the apparent contradictions of nature\nby referring them to the two opposing principles of \u201cstrife\u201d and \u201cfriendship;\u201d\nand the theory of Leucippus,10 which resolved all existence into the two elements\nof a plenum and a vacuum, are of this nature. The famous comparison of the\nuniverse to a lyre or a bow,11 its \u201crecurrent harmony\u201d being the product of\nopposite states of tension, betrays the same origin. In the system of Pythagoras,\nwhich seems to have been a combination of dualism with other elements derived\nfrom the study of numbers, and of their relations, ten fundamental antitheses\nare recognised: finite and infinite, even and odd, unity and multitude, right\nand left, male and female, rest and motion, straight and curved, light and\ndarkness, good and evil, the square and the oblong. In that of Alcm\u00e6on the\nsame fundamental dualism is accepted, but without the definite and numerical\nlimitation with which it is connected in the Pythagorean system. The grand\ndevelopment of this idea is, however, met with in that ancient Manich\u00e6an\ndoctrine, which not only formed the basis of the religious system of Persia,\nbut spread widely through other regions of the East, and became memorable\nin the history of the Christian Church.

The\ntwo forms of speculation which we have considered were here blended together;\nnor was it during the youth and maturity of Greek philosophy alone that the\ntendencies of thought above described were manifested. Ages of imitation\ncaught up and adopted as their own the same spirit. Especially wherever the\ngenius of Plato exercised sway was this influence felt. The unity of all real\nbeing, its identity with truth and goodness considered as to their essence;\nthe illusion, the profound unreality, of all merely ph\u00e6nomenal existence; such\nwere the views,\u2014such the dispositions of thought, which it chiefly tended to\nfoster. Hence that strong tendency to mysticism which, when the days of\nrenown, whether on the field of intellectual or on that of social enterprise, had\nended in Greece, became prevalent in her schools of philosophy, and reached\ntheir culminating point among the Alexandrian Platonists. The supposititious\ntreatises of Dionysius the Areopagite served to convey the same influence, much\nmodified by its contact with Aristotelian doctrines, to the scholastic disputants\nof the middle ages. It can furnish no just ground of controversy to say, that the\ntone of thought thus encouraged was as little consistent with genuine devotion\nas with a sober philosophy. That kindly influence of human affections, that\nhomely intercourse with the common things of life, which form so large a part\nof the true, because intended, discipline of our nature, would be ill replaced\nby the contemplation even of the highest object of thought, viewed by an\nexcessive abstraction as something concerning which not a single intelligible\nproposition could either be affirmed or denied.14I would but slightly allude to\nthose connected speculations on the Divine Nature which ascribed to it the\nperfect union of opposite qualities,15or to the remarkable treatises of Anselm,\n12\u2019E\u03c0\u03b5`\u03b9 \u03b4 `\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 \u03c4 `\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u00b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4 o\u02dc\u03b9\u03c2 \u00b4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8o\u02dc\u03b9\u03c2 \u00b4\u03b5\u03bd \u00b4o\u03bd\u03c4 \u03b1 \u00b4\u03b5\u03d5\u03b1\u00b4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4 o \u00b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4 \u02dc\u03b7 \u03d5\u00b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 o\u00b4\u03c5\n\u03bc\u00b4o\u03bdo\u03bd \u03c4 \u00b4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 \u03c4 `o \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb`o\u03bd \u00b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb `\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 \u00b4\u03b1\u03c4 \u03b1\u03be\u00b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 \u03c4 `o \u03b1\u00b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03c1\u00b4o\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u00b4\u03b9\u03c9 \u03c4 `\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba `\u03b1\n\u03c4 \u02dc\u03c9\u03bd \u00b4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8 \u02dc\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 \u03c4 `\u03b1 \u03d5\u03b1\u02dc\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4 \u02dc\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u02dc\u03c9\u03bd, o\u00a8\u03c5\u03c4 \u03c9\u03c2 \u00a8\u03b1\u03bb\u03bbo\u03c2 \u03c4 \u03b9\u03c2 \u03d5\u03b9\u03bb\u00b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u00b4\u03b9\u03c3 \u00b4\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1`\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b5\u02dc\u03b9\u03bao\u03c2,\n`\u03b5\u03ba \u00b4\u03b1\u03c4 \u03b5\u03c1o\u03bd `\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4 \u00b4\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u00a8\u03b9\u03c4 \u03b9o\u03bd \u03c4 o\u00b4\u03c5\u03c4 \u03c9\u03bd.\u2014Arist.

The conformity of Nature to her laws, the obedience of\nmoral agents to the dictates of rectitude, are the same Truth seen in action;\nthe world itself being but an expression of the self-reflecting thought of its\nAuthor.17Still more marked was the revival of the older forms of speculation\nduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The friends and associates\nof Lorenzo the Magnificent, the recluses known in England as the Cambridge\nPlatonists, together with many meditative spirits scattered through Europe,\ndevoted themselves anew, either to the task of solving the ancient problem,\nDe Uno, Vero, Bono, or to that of proving that all such inquiries are futile\nand vain.18The logical elements which underlie all these speculations, and from\nwhich they appear to borrow at least their form, it would be easy to trace in\nthe outlines of more modern systems,\u2013more especially in that association of the\ndoctrine of the absolute unity with the distinction of the ego and the non-ego\nas the type of Nature, which forms the basis of the philosophy of Hegel. The\nattempts of speculative minds to ascend to some high pinnacle of truth, from\nwhich they might survey the entire framework and connexion of things in the\norder of deductive thought, have differed less in the forms of theory which they\nhave produced, than through the nature of the interpretations which have been\nassigned to those forms.19And herein lies the real question as to the influence of\nphilosophical systems upon the disposition and the life. For though it is of slight\nmoment that men should agree in tracing back all the forms and conditions of\nbeing to a primal unity, it is otherwise as concerns their conceptions of what\nthat unity is, and what are the kinds of relation, beside that of mere causality,\nSacred Latin Poetry.) The principle upon which all these speculations rest is thus stated in\nthe treatise referred to in the last note. \u039f\u03c5\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b7\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd, \u03b5\u03be \u03b1\u03bc\u03c8\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\n\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b7\u03c8\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c0\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03b5\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03c0\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03c2,\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7\u03b1\u03b5\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 .\u2014De Divinis Nominibus, cap. v.

It\nis asked:\u2014\u201dOr non `e egli chiaro che ogni discorso si riduce in fine in fine alle idee di Dio, del\nmondo, e della creazione, l\u2019ultima delle quali `e il legame delle due prime?\u201d And this question\nbeing affirmatively answered in the formula, \u201dl\u2019Ente crea le esistenze,\u201d it is said of that\nformula,\u2014\u201dEssa abbraccia la realt`a universale nella dualit`a del necessario e del contingente,\nesprime il vincolo di questi due ordini, e collocandolo nella creazion sostanziale, riduce la\ndualit`a reale a un principio unico, all unit`a primordiale dell\u2019Ente non astratto, complessivo, e\ngenerico, ma concreto, individuato, assoluto, e creatore.\u201d\u2014Del Bello e del Buono, pp. 30, 31.\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 324\nwhich it sustains to themselves. Herein too may be felt the powerlessness of\nmere Logic, the insufficiency of the profoundest knowledge of the laws of the\nunderstanding, to resolve those problems which lie nearer to our hearts, as\nprogressive years strip away from our life the illusions of its golden dawn.\n8. If the extremely arbitrary character of human opinion be considered, it\nwill not be expected, nor is it here maintained, that the above are the only\nforms in which speculative men have shaped their conjectural solutions of the\nproblem of existence. Under particular influences other forms of doctrine have\narisen, not unfrequently, however, masking those portrayed above.20\nBut the wide prevalence of the particular theories which we have considered,\ntogether with their manifest analogy with the expressed laws of thought, may\njustly be conceived to indicate a connexion between the two systems. As all\nother mental acts and procedures are beset by their peculiar fallacies, so the\noperation of that law of thought termed in this work the law of duality may\nhave its own peculiar tendency to error, exalting mere want of agreement into\ncontrariety, and thus form a world which we necessarily view as formed of parts\nsupplemental to each other, framing the conception of a world fundamentally\ndivided by opposing powers. Such, with some large but hasty inductions\nfrom ph\u00e6nomena, may have been the origin of dualism,\u2014independently of the\nquestion whether dualism is in any form a true theory or not. Here, however, it\nis of more importance to consider in detail the bearing of these ancient forms of\nspeculation, as revived in the present day, upon the progress of real knowledge;\nand upon this point I desire, in pursuance of what has been said in the previous\nsection, to add the following remarks:\n1st. All sound philosophy gives its verdict against such speculations, if\nregarded as a means of determining the actual constitution of things. It may be\nthat the progress of natural knowledge tends towards the recognition of some\ncentral Unity in Nature. Of such unity as consists in the mutual relation of\nthe parts of a system there can be little doubt, and able men have speculated,\nnot without grounds, on a more intimate correlation of physical forces than\nthe mere idea of a system would lead us to conjecture. Further, it may be\nthat in the bosom of that supposed unity are involved some general principles\nof division and re-union, the sources, under the Supreme Will, of much of the\nrelated variety of Nature. The instances of sex and polarity have been adduced\nin support of such a view. As a supposition, I will venture to add, that it is\nnot very improbable that, in some such way as this, the constitution of things\nwithout may correspond to that of the mind within. But such correspondence,\nif it shall ever be proved to exist, will appear as the last induction from human\nknowledge, not as the first principle of scientific inquiry. The natural order\n20Evidence in support of this statement will be found in the remarkable treatise\nrecently published under the title (the correctness of which seems doubtful) of Origenis\nPhilosophumena. The early corruptions of Christianity of which it contains the record, though\nmany of them, as is evident from their Ophite character, derived from the very dregs of\npaganism, manifest certain persistent forms of philosophical speculation. For the most part\nthey either belong to the dualistic scheme, or recognise three principles, primary or derived,\nbetween two of which the dualistic relation may be traced\u2014Orig. Phil., pp. 135, 139, 150,\n235, 253, 264.\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 325\nof discovery is from the particular to the universal, and it may confidently be\naffirmed that we have not yet advanced sufficiently far on this track to enable us\nto determine what are the ultimate forms into which all the special differences\nof Nature shall merge, and from which they shall receive their explanation.\n2ndly. Were this correspondence between the forms of thought and the\nactual constitution of Nature proved to exist, whatsoever connexion or relation\nit might be supposed to establish between the two systems, it would in no degree\naffect the question of their mutual independence. It would in no sense lead to\nthe consequence that the one system is the mere product of the other. A too\ngreat addiction to metaphysical speculations seems, in some instances, to have\nproduced a tendency toward this species of illusion. Thus, among the many\nattempts which have been made to explain the existence of evil, it has been\nsought to assign to the fact a merely relative character,\u2014to found it upon a\nspecies of logical opposition to the equally relative element of good. It suffices\nto say, that the assumption is purely gratuitous. What evil may be in the eyes of\nInfinite wisdom and purity, we can at the best but dimly conjecture; but to us,\nin all its forms, whether of pain or defect, or moral transgression, or retributory\nwo, it can wear but one aspect,\u2014that of a sad and stern reality, against which,\nupon somewhat more than the highest order of prudential considerations, the\nwhole preventive force of our nature may be exerted. Now what has been said\nupon the particular question just considered, is equally applicable to many other\nof the debated points of philosophy; such, for instance, as the external reality of\nspace and time. We have no warrant for resolving these into mere forms of the\nunderstanding, though they unquestionably determine the present sphere of our\nknowledge. And, to speak more generally, there is no warrant for the extremely\nsubjective tendency of much modern speculation. Whenever, in the view of the\nintellect, different hypotheses are equally consistent with an observed fact, the\ninstinctive testimony of consciousness as to their relative value must be allowed\nto possess authority.\n3rdly. If the study of the laws of thought avails us neither to determine\nthe actual constitution of things, nor to explain the facts involved in that\nconstitution which have perplexed the wise and saddened the thoughtful in\nall ages,\u2014still less does it enable us to rise above the present conditions of\nour being, or lend its sanction to the doctrine which affirms the possibility of\nan intuitive knowledge of the infinite, and the unconditioned,\u2014whether such\nknowledge be sought for in the realm of Nature, or above that realm. We can\nnever be said to comprehend that which is represented to thought as the limit of\nan indefinite process of abstraction. A progression ad infinitum is impossible to\nfinite powers. But though we cannot comprehend the infinite, there may be even\nscientific grounds for believing that human nature is constituted in some relation\nto the infinite. We cannot perfectly express the laws of thought, or establish\nin the most general sense the methods of which they form the basis, without\nat least the implication of elements which ordinary language expresses by the\nterms \u201cUniverse\u201d and \u201cEternity.\u201d As in the pure abstractions of Geometry, so\nin the domain of Logic it is seen, that the empire of Truth is, in a certain sense,\nlarger than that of Imagination. And as there are many special departments\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 326\nof knowledge which can only be completely surveyed from an external point,\nso the theory of the intellectual processes, as applied only to finite objects,\nseems to involve the recognition of a sphere of thought from which all limits\nare withdrawn. If then, on the one hand, we cannot discover in the laws of\nthought and their analogies a sufficient basis of proof for the conclusions of a too\ndaring mysticism; on the other hand we should err in regarding them as wholly\nunsuggestive. As parts of our intellectual nature, it seems not improbable that\nthey should manifest their presence otherwise than by merely prescribing the\nconditions of formal inference. Whatever grounds we have for connecting them\nwith the peculiar tendencies of physical speculation among the Ionian and Italic\nphilosophers, the same grounds exist for associating them with a disposition of\nthought at once more common and more legitimate. To no casual influences, at\nleast, ought we to attribute that meditative spirit which then most delights to\ncommune with the external magnificence of Nature, when most impressed with\nthe consciousness of sempiternal verities,\u2014which reads in the nocturnal heavens\na bright manifestation of order; or feels in some wild scene among the hills, the\nintimations of more than that abstract eternity which had rolled away ere yet\ntheir dark foundations were laid.21\n9. Refraining from the further prosecution of a train of thought which to\nsome may appear to be of too speculative a character, let us briefly review the\npositive results to which we have been led. It has appeared that there exist in our\nnature faculties which enable us to ascend from the particular facts of experience\nto the general propositions which form the basis of Science; as well as faculties\nwhose office it is to deduce from general propositions accepted as true the\nparticular conclusions which they involve. It has been seen, that those faculties\nare subject in their operations to laws capable of precise scientific expression,\nbut invested with an authority which, as contrasted with the authority of the\nlaws of nature, is distinct, sui generis, and underived. Further, there has\nappeared to be a manifest fitness between the intellectual procedure thus made\nknown to us, and the conditions of that system of things by which we are\nsurrounded,\u2014such conditions, I mean, as the existence of species connected\nby general resemblances, of facts associated under general laws; together with\nthat union of permanency with order, which while it gives stability to acquired\nknowledge, lays a foundation for the hope of indefinite progression. Human\nnature, quite independently of its observed or manifested tendencies, is seen to\nbe constituted in a certain relation to Truth; and this relation, considered as a\nsubject of speculative knowledge, is as capable of being studied in its details,\nis, moreover, as worthy of being so studied, as are the several departments\nof physical science, considered in the same aspect. I would especially direct\nattention to that view of the constitution of the intellect which represents it\nas subject to laws determinate in their character, but not operating by the\npower of necessity; which exhibits it as redeemed from the dominion of fate,\nwithout being abandoned to the lawlessness of chance. We cannot embrace\nthis view without accepting at least as probable the intimations which, upon\n21Psalm xc. 2\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 327\nthe principle of analogy, it seems to furnish respecting another and a higher\naspect of our nature,\u2014its subjection in the sphere of duty as well as in that\nof knowledge to fixed laws whose authority does not consist in power,\u2014its\nconstitution with reference to an ideal standard and a final purpose. It has been\nthought, indeed, that scientific pursuits foster a disposition either to overlook\nthe specific differences between the moral and the material world, or to regard\nthe former as in no proper sense a subject for exact knowledge. Doubtless all\nexclusive pursuits tend to produce partial views, and it may be, that a mind long\nand deeply immersed in the contemplation of scenes over which the dominion of\na physical necessity is unquestioned and supreme, may admit with difficulty the\npossibility of another order of things. But it is because of the exclusiveness of\nthis devotion to a particular sphere of knowledge, that the prejudice in question\ntakes possession, if at all, of the mind. The application of scientific methods\nto the study of the intellectual ph\u00e6nomena, conducted in an impartial spirit\nof inquiry, and without overlooking those elements of error and disturbance\nwhich must be accepted as facts, though they cannot be regarded as laws, in\nthe constitution of our nature, seems to furnish the materials of a juster analogy.\n10. If it be asked to what practical end such inquiries as the above point, it\nmay be replied, that there exist various objects, in relation to which the courses\nof men\u2019s actions are mainly determined by their speculative views of human\nnature. Education, considered in its largest sense, is one of those objects. The\nultimate ground of all inquiry into its nature and its methods must be laid in\nsome previous theory of what man is, what are the ends for which his several\nfaculties were designed, what are the motives which have power to influence\nthem to sustained action, and to elicit their most perfect and most stable results.\nIt may be doubted, whether these questions have ever been considered fully,\nand at the same time impartially, in the relations here suggested. The highest\ncultivation of taste by the study of the pure models of antiquity, the largest\nacquaintance with the facts and theories of modern physical science, viewed\nfrom this larger aspect of our nature, can only appear as parts of a perfect\nintellectual discipline. Looking from the same point of view upon the means to\nbe employed, we might be led to inquire, whether that all but exclusive appeal\nwhich is made in the present day to the spirit of emulation or cupidity, does\nnot tend to weaken the influence of those more enduring motives which seem to\nhave been implanted in our nature for the immediate end in view. Upon these,\nand upon many other questions, the just limits of authority, the reconciliation\nof freedom of thought with discipline of feelings, habits, manners, and upon\nthe whole moral aspect of the question,\u2014what unfixedness of opinion, what\ndiversity of practice, do we meet with! Yet, in the sober view of reason, there\nis no object within the compass of human endeavours which is of more weight\nand moment than this, considered, as I have said, in its largest meaning. Now,\nwhatsoever tends to make more exact and definite our view of human nature, in\nany of its real aspects, tends, in the same proportion, to reduce these questions\ninto narrower compass, and restrict the limits of their possible solution. Thus\nmay even speculative inquiries prove fruitful of the most important principles\nof action.\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 328\n11. Perhaps the most obviously legitimate bearing of such speculations\nwould be upon the question of the place of Mathematics in the system of\nhuman knowledge, and the nature and office of mathematical studies, as a\nmeans of intellectual discipline. No one who has attended to the course of\nrecent discussions can think this question an unimportant one. Those who have\nmaintained that the position of Mathematics is in both respects a fundamental\none, have drawn one of their strongest arguments from the actual constitution\nof things. The material frame is subject in all its parts to the relations of\nnumber. All dynamical, chemical, electrical, thermal, actions, seem not only\nto be measurable in themselves, but to be connected with each other, even\nto the extent of mutual convertibility, by numerical relations of a perfectly\ndefinite kind. But the opinion in question seems to me to rest upon a deeper\nbasis than this. The laws of thought, in all its processes of conception and of\nreasoning, in all those operations of which language is the expression or the\ninstrument, are of the same kind as are the laws of the acknowledged processes\nof Mathematics. It is not contended that it is necessary for us to acquaint\nourselves with those laws in order to think coherently, or, in the ordinary sense\nof the terms, to reason well. Men draw inferences without any consciousness of\nthose elements upon which the entire procedure depends. Still less is it desired\nto exalt the reasoning faculty over the faculties of observation, of reflection,\nand of judgment. But upon the very ground that human thought, traced to its\nultimate elements, reveals itself in mathematical forms, we have a presumption\nthat the mathematical sciences occupy, by the constitution of our nature, a\nfundamental place in human knowledge, and that no system of mental culture\ncan be complete or fundamental, which altogether neglects them.\nBut the very same class of considerations shows with equal force the error\nof those who regard the study of Mathematics, and of their applications, as a\nsufficient basis either of knowledge or of discipline. If the constitution of the\nmaterial frame is mathematical, it is not merely so. If the mind, in its capacity\nof formal reasoning, obeys, whether consciously or unconsciously, mathematical\nlaws, it claims through its other capacities of sentiment and action, through its\nperceptions of beauty and of moral fitness, through its deep springs of emotion\nand affection, to hold relation to a different order of things. There is, moreover,\na breadth of intellectual vision, a power of sympathy with truth in all its forms\nand manifestations, which is not measured by the force and subtlety of the\ndialectic faculty. Even the revelation of the material universe in its boundless\nmagnitude, and pervading order, and constancy of law, is not necessarily the\nmost fully apprehended by him who has traced with minutest accuracy the steps\nof the great demonstration. And if we embrace in our survey the interests and\nduties of life, how little do any processes of mere ratiocination enable us to\ncomprehend the weightier questions which they present! As truly, therefore, as\nthe cultivation of the mathematical or deductive faculty is a part of intellectual\ndiscipline, so truly is it only a part. The prejudice which would either banish\nor make supreme any one department of knowledge or faculty of mind, betrays\nnot only error of judgment, but a defect of that intellectual modesty which is\ninseparable from a pure devotion to truth. It assumes the office of criticising\nCHAPTER XXII. CONSTITUTION OF THE INTELLECT 329\na constitution of things which no human appointment has established, or can\nannul. It sets aside the ancient and just conception of truth as one though\nmanifold. Much of this error, as actually existent among us, seems due to\nthe special and isolated character of scientific teaching\u2014which character it,\nin its turn, tends to foster. The study of philosophy, notwithstanding a few\nmarked instances of exception, has failed to keep pace with the advance of the\nseveral departments of knowledge, whose mutual relations it is its province to\ndetermine. It is impossible, however, not to contemplate the particular evil in\nquestion as part of a larger system, and connect it with the too prevalent view of\nknowledge as a merely secular thing, and with the undue predominance, already\nadverted to, of those motives, legitimate within their proper limits, which are\nfounded upon a regard to its secular advantages. In the extreme case it is not\ndifficult to see that the continued operation of such motives, uncontrolled by\nany higher principles of action, uncorrected by the personal influence of superior\nminds, must tend to lower the standard of thought in reference to the objects\nof knowledge, and to render void and ineffectual whatsoever elements of a noble\nfaith may still survive. And ever in proportion as these conditions are realized\nmust the same effects follow. Hence, perhaps, it is that we sometimes find juster\nconceptions of the unity, the vital connexion, and the subordination to a moral\npurpose, of the different parts of Truth, among those who acknowledge nothing\nhigher than the changing aspect of collective humanity, than among those who\nprofess an intellectual allegiance to the Father of Lights. But these are questions\nwhich cannot further be pursued here. To some they will appear foreign to\nthe professed design of this work. But the consideration of them has arisen\nnaturally, either out of the speculations which that design involved, or in the\ncourse of reading and reflection which seemed necessary to its accomplishment.\nthe end.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2019s The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, by George Boole\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

W.I\nPREFACE.\nIn presenting this Work to public notice, I deem it not irrelevant to ob-\nserve, that speculations similar to those which it records have, at different\nperiods, occupied my thoughts. In the spring of the present year my atten-\ntion was directed to the question then moved between Sir W. Hamilton and\nProfessor De Morgan; and I was induced by the interest which it inspired,\nto resume the almost-forgotten thread of former inquiries. It appeared to\nme that, although Logic might be viewed with reference to the idea of\nquantity,\u2217 it had also another and a deeper system of relations. If it was\nlawful to regard it from without, as connecting itself through the medium\nof Number with the intuitions of Space and Time, it was lawful also to\nregard it from within, as based upon facts of another order which have\ntheir abode in the constitution of the Mind. The results of this view, and\nof the inquiries which it suggested, are embodied in the following Treatise.\nIt is not generally permitted to an Author to prescribe the mode in\nwhich his production shall be judged; but there are two conditions which\nI may venture to require of those who shall undertake to estimate the\nmerits of this performance. The first is, that no preconceived notion of\nthe impossibility of its objects shall be permitted to interfere with that\ncandour and impartiality which the investigation of Truth demands; the\nsecond is, that their judgment of the system as a whole shall not be founded\neither upon the examination of only a part of it, or upon the measure of its\nconformity with any received system, considered as a standard of reference\nfrom which appeal is denied. It is in the general theorems which occupy\nthe latter chapters of this work,\u2014results to which there is no existing\ncounterpart,\u2014that the claims of the method, as a Calculus of Deductive\nReasoning, are most fully set forth.\nWhat may be the final estimate of the value of the system, I have\nneither the wish nor the right to anticipate. The estimation of a theory is\n\u2217See p. 43.\npreface. 2\nnot simply determined by its truth. It also depends upon the importance\nof its subject, and the extent of its applications; beyond which something\nmust still be left to the arbitrariness of human Opinion. If the utility of\nthe application of Mathematical forms to the science of Logic were solely a\nquestion of Notation, I should be content to rest the defence of this attempt\nupon a principle which has been stated by an able living writer: \u201cWhenever\nthe nature of the subject permits the reasoning process to be without\ndanger carried on mechanically, the language should be constructed on as\nmechanical principles as possible; while in the contrary case it should be\nso constructed, that there shall be the greatest possible obstacle to a mere\nmechanical use of it.\u201d\u2217 In one respect, the science of Logic differs from\nall others; the perfection of its method is chiefly valuable as an evidence\nof the speculative truth of its principles. To supersede the employment of\ncommon reason, or to subject it to the rigour of technical forms, would\nbe the last desire of one who knows the value of that intellectual toil and\nwarfare which imparts to the mind an athletic vigour, and teaches it to\ncontend with difficulties and to rely upon itself in emergencies.\nLincoln, Oct. 29, 1847.\n\u2217Mill\u2019s System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive, Vol. ii. p. 292.\nMATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF LOGIC.\nINTRODUCTION.\nThey who are acquainted with the present state of the theory of Sym-\nbolical Algebra, are aware, that the validity of the processes of analysis\ndoes not depend upon the interpretation of the symbols which are em-\nployed, but solely upon the laws of their combination. Every system of\ninterpretation which does not affect the truth of the relations supposed, is\nequally admissible, and it is thus that the same process may, under one\nscheme of interpretation, represent the solution of a question on the prop-\nerties of numbers, under another, that of a geometrical problem, and under\na third, that of a problem of dynamics or optics. This principle is indeed\nof fundamental importance; and it may with safety be affirmed, that the\nrecent advances of pure analysis have been much assisted by the influence\nwhich it has exerted in directing the current of investigation.\nBut the full recognition of the consequences of this important doctrine\nhas been, in some measure, retarded by accidental circumstances. It has\nhappened in every known form of analysis, that the elements to be deter-\nmined have been conceived as measurable by comparison with some fixed\nstandard. The predominant idea has been that of magnitude, or more\nstrictly, of numerical ratio. The expression of magnitude, or of operations\nupon magnitude, has been the express object for which the symbols of\nAnalysis have been invented, and for which their laws have been investi-\ngated. Thus the abstractions of the modern Analysis, not less than the\nostensive diagrams of the ancient Geometry, have encouraged the notion,\nthat Mathematics are essentially, as well as actually, the Science of Mag-\nnitude.\nThe consideration of that view which has already been stated, as em-\nbodying the true principle of the Algebra of Symbols, would, however, lead\nus to infer that this conclusion is by no means necessary. If every exist-\nintroduction. 4\ning interpretation is shewn to involve the idea of magnitude, it is only by\ninduction that we can assert that no other interpretation is possible. And\nit may be doubted whether our experience is sufficient to render such an\ninduction legitimate. The history of pure Analysis is, it may be said, too\nrecent to permit us to set limits to the extent of its applications. Should\nwe grant to the inference a high degree of probability, we might still, and\nwith reason, maintain the sufficiency of the definition to which the princi-\nple already stated would lead us. We might justly assign it as the definitive\ncharacter of a true Calculus, that it is a method resting upon the employ-\nment of Symbols, whose laws of combination are known and general, and\nwhose results admit of a consistent interpretation. That to the existing\nforms of Analysis a quantitative interpretation is assigned, is the result of\nthe circumstances by which those forms were determined, and is not to be\nconstrued into a universal condition of Analysis. It is upon the foundation\nof this general principle, that I purpose to establish the Calculus of Logic,\nand that I claim for it a place among the acknowledged forms of Math-\nematical Analysis, regardless that in its object and in its instruments it\nmust at present stand alone.\nThat which renders Logic possible, is the existence in our minds of\ngeneral notions,\u2014our ability to conceive of a class, and to designate its\nindividual members by a common name. The theory of Logic is thus inti-\nmately connected with that of Language. A successful attempt to express\nlogical propositions by symbols, the laws of whose combinations should\nbe founded upon the laws of the mental processes which they represent,\nwould, so far, be a step toward a philosophical language. But this is a view\nwhich we need not here follow into detail.\u2217 Assuming the notion of a class,\n\u2217This view is well expressed in one of Blanco White\u2019s Letters:\u2014\u201cLogic is for the most\npart a collection of technical rules founded on classification. The Syllogism is nothing\nbut a result of the classification of things, which the mind naturally and necessarily\nforms, in forming a language. All abstract terms are classifications; or rather the labels\nof the classes which the mind has settled.\u201d\u2014Memoirs of the Rev. Joseph Blanco White,\nvol. ii. p. 163. See also, for a very lucid introduction, Dr. Latham\u2019s First Outlines of\nLogic applied to Language, Becker\u2019s German Grammar, &c. Extreme Nominalists make\nintroduction. 5\nwe are able, from any conceivable collection of objects, to separate by a\nmental act, those which belong to the given class, and to contemplate them\napart from the rest. Such, or a similar act of election, we may conceive\nto be repeated. The group of individuals left under consideration may be\nstill further limited, by mentally selecting those among them which belong\nto some other recognised class, as well as to the one before contemplated.\nAnd this process may be repeated with other elements of distinction, until\nwe arrive at an individual possessing all the distinctive characters which\nwe have taken into account, and a member, at the same time, of every class\nwhich we have enumerated. It is in fact a method similar to this which we\nemploy whenever, in common language, we accumulate descriptive epithets\nfor the sake of more precise definition.\nNow the several mental operations which in the above case we have\nsupposed to be performed, are subject to peculiar laws. It is possible to\nassign relations among them, whether as respects the repetition of a given\noperation or the succession of different ones, or some other particular,\nwhich are never violated. It is, for example, true that the result of two\nsuccessive acts is unaffected by the order in which they are performed; and\nthere are at least two other laws which will be pointed out in the proper\nplace. These will perhaps to some appear so obvious as to be ranked among\nnecessary truths, and so little important as to be undeserving of special\nnotice. And probably they are noticed for the first time in this Essay. Yet\nit may with confidence be asserted, that if they were other than they are,\nthe entire mechanism of reasoning, nay the very laws and constitution of\nthe human intellect, would be vitally changed. A Logic might indeed exist,\nbut it would no longer be the Logic we possess.\nSuch are the elementary laws upon the existence of which, and upon\ntheir capability of exact symbolical expression, the method of the follow-\ning Essay is founded; and it is presumed that the object which it seeks to\nattain will be thought to have been very fully accomplished. Every log-\nLogic entirely dependent upon language. For the opposite view, see Cudworth\u2019s Eternal\nand Immutable Morality, Book iv. Chap. iii.\nintroduction. 6\nical proposition, whether categorical or hypothetical, will be found to be\ncapable of exact and rigorous expression, and not only will the laws of con-\nversion and of syllogism be thence deducible, but the resolution of the most\ncomplex systems of propositions, the separation of any proposed element,\nand the expression of its value in terms of the remaining elements, with\nevery subsidiary relation involved. Every process will represent deduction,\nevery mathematical consequence will express a logical inference. The gen-\nerality of the method will even permit us to express arbitrary operations\nof the intellect, and thus lead to the demonstration of general theorems in\nlogic analogous, in no slight degree, to the general theorems of ordinary\nmathematics. No inconsiderable part of the pleasure which we derive from\nthe application of analysis to the interpretation of external nature, arises\nfrom the conceptions which it enables us to form of the universality of the\ndominion of law. The general formul\u00e6 to which we are conducted seem\nto give to that element a visible presence, and the multitude of particular\ncases to which they apply, demonstrate the extent of its sway. Even the\nsymmetry of their analytical expression may in no fanciful sense be deemed\nindicative of its harmony and its consistency. Now I do not presume to say\nto what extent the same sources of pleasure are opened in the following\nEssay. The measure of that extent may be left to the estimate of those\nwho shall think the subject worthy of their study. But I may venture to\nassert that such occasions of intellectual gratification are not here wanting.\nThe laws we have to examine are the laws of one of the most important\nof our mental faculties. The mathematics we have to construct are the\nmathematics of the human intellect. Nor are the form and character of the\nmethod, apart from all regard to its interpretation, undeserving of notice.\nThere is even a remarkable exemplification, in its general theorems, of that\nspecies of excellence which consists in freedom from exception. And this\nis observed where, in the corresponding cases of the received mathematics,\nsuch a character is by no means apparent. The few who think that there\nis that in analysis which renders it deserving of attention for its own sake,\nmay find it worth while to study it under a form in which every equation\ncan be solved and every solution interpreted. Nor will it lessen the interest\nintroduction. 7\nof this study to reflect that every peculiarity which they will notice in the\nform of the Calculus represents a corresponding feature in the constitution\nof their own minds.\nIt would be premature to speak of the value which this method may\npossess as an instrument of scientific investigation. I speak here with refer-\nence to the theory of reasoning, and to the principle of a true classification\nof the forms and cases of Logic considered as a Science.\u2217 The aim of these\ninvestigations was in the first instance confined to the expression of the\nreceived logic, and to the forms of the Aristotelian arrangement, but it\nsoon became apparent that restrictions were thus introduced, which were\npurely arbitrary and had no foundation in the nature of things. These were\nnoted as they occurred, and will be discussed in the proper place. When it\nbecame necessary to consider the subject of hypothetical propositions (in\nwhich comparatively less has been done), and still more, when an inter-\npretation was demanded for the general theorems of the Calculus, it was\nfound to be imperative to dismiss all regard for precedent and authority,\nand to interrogate the method itself for an expression of the just limits of\nits application. Still, however, there was no special effort to arrive at novel\nresults. But among those which at the time of their discovery appeared to\nbe such, it may be proper to notice the following.\nA logical proposition is, according to the method of this Essay, express-\nible by an equation the form of which determines the rules of conversion\nand of transformation, to which the given proposition is subject. Thus the\nlaw of what logicians term simple conversion, is determined by the fact,\nthat the corresponding equations are symmetrical, that they are unaffected\nby a mutual change of place, in those symbols which correspond to the con-\nvertible classes. The received laws of conversion were thus determined, and\nafterwards another system, which is thought to be more elementary, and\nmore general. See Chapter, On the Conversion of Propositions.\n\u2217\u201cStrictly a Science\u201d; also \u201can Art.\u201d\u2014Whately\u2019s Elements of Logic. Indeed ought\nwe not to regard all Art as applied Science; unless we are willing, with \u201cthe multitude,\u201d\nto consider Art as \u201cguessing and aiming well\u201d?\u2014Plato, Philebus.\nintroduction. 8\nThe premises of a syllogism being expressed by equations, the elimina-\ntion of a common symbol between them leads to a third equation which\nexpresses the conclusion, this conclusion being always the most general\npossible, whether Aristotelian or not. Among the cases in which no infer-\nence was possible, it was found, that there were two distinct forms of the\nfinal equation. It was a considerable time before the explanation of this\nfact was discovered, but it was at length seen to depend upon the presence\nor absence of a true medium of comparison between the premises. The\ndistinction which is thought to be new is illustrated in the Chapter, On\nSyllogisms.\nThe nonexclusive character of the disjunctive conclusion of a hypothet-\nical syllogism, is very clearly pointed out in the examples of this species of\nargument.\nThe class of logical problems illustrated in the chapter, On the Solution\nof Elective Equations, is conceived to be new: and it is believed that the\nmethod of that chapter affords the means of a perfect analysis of any\nconceivable system of propositions, an end toward which the rules for the\nconversion of a single categorical proposition are but the first step.\nHowever, upon the originality of these or any of these views, I am\nconscious that I possess too slight an acquaintance with the literature of\nlogical science, and especially with its older literature, to permit me to\nspeak with confidence.\nIt may not be inappropriate, before concluding these observations, to\noffer a few remarks upon the general question of the use of symbolical\nlanguage in the mathematics. Objections have lately been very strongly\nurged against this practice, on the ground, that by obviating the necessity\nof thought, and substituting a reference to general formul\u00e6 in the room of\npersonal effort, it tends to weaken the reasoning faculties.\nNow the question of the use of symbols may be considered in two dis-\ntinct points of view. First, it may be considered with reference to the\nprogress of scientific discovery, and secondly, with reference to its bearing\nupon the discipline of the intellect.\nAnd with respect to the first view, it may be observed that as it is\nintroduction. 9\none fruit of an accomplished labour, that it sets us at liberty to engage\nin more arduous toils, so it is a necessary result of an advanced state\nof science, that we are permitted, and even called upon, to proceed to\nhigher problems, than those which we before contemplated. The practical\ninference is obvious. If through the advancing power of scientific methods,\nwe find that the pursuits on which we were once engaged, afford no longer\na sufficiently ample field for intellectual effort, the remedy is, to proceed to\nhigher inquiries, and, in new tracks, to seek for difficulties yet unsubdued.\nAnd such is, indeed, the actual law of scientific progress. We must be\ncontent, either to abandon the hope of further conquest, or to employ such\naids of symbolical language, as are proper to the stage of progress, at which\nwe have arrived. Nor need we fear to commit ourselves to such a course.\nWe have not yet arrived so near to the boundaries of possible knowledge,\nas to suggest the apprehension, that scope will fail for the exercise of the\ninventive faculties.\nIn discussing the second, and scarcely less momentous question of the\ninfluence of the use of symbols upon the discipline of the intellect, an im-\nportant distinction ought to be made. It is of most material consequence,\nwhether those symbols are used with a full understanding of their meaning,\nwith a perfect comprehension of that which renders their use lawful, and\nan ability to expand the abbreviated forms of reasoning which they induce,\ninto their full syllogistic development; or whether they are mere unsugges-\ntive characters, the use of which is suffered to rest upon authority.\nThe answer which must be given to the question proposed, will differ\naccording as the one or the other of these suppositions is admitted. In the\nformer case an intellectual discipline of a high order is provided, an exercise\nnot only of reason, but of the faculty of generalization. In the latter case\nthere is no mental discipline whatever. It were perhaps the best security\nagainst the danger of an unreasoning reliance upon symbols, on the one\nhand, and a neglect of their just claims on the other, that each subject\nof applied mathematics should be treated in the spirit of the methods\nwhich were known at the time when the application was made, but in the\nbest form which those methods have assumed. The order of attainment in\nintroduction. 10\nthe individual mind would thus bear some relation to the actual order of\nscientific discovery, and the more abstract methods of the higher analysis\nwould be offered to such minds only, as were prepared to receive them.\nThe relation in which this Essay stands at once to Logic and to Math-\nematics, may further justify some notice of the question which has lately\nbeen revived, as to the relative value of the two studies in a liberal ed-\nucation. One of the chief objections which have been urged against the\nstudy of Mathematics in general, is but another form of that which has\nbeen already considered with respect to the use of symbols in particular.\nAnd it need not here be further dwelt upon, than to notice, that if it avails\nanything, it applies with an equal force against the study of Logic. The\ncanonical forms of the Aristotelian syllogism are really symbolical; only the\nsymbols are less perfect of their kind than those of mathematics. If they\nare employed to test the validity of an argument, they as truly supersede\nthe exercise of reason, as does a reference to a formula of analysis. Whether\nmen do, in the present day, make this use of the Aristotelian canons, ex-\ncept as a special illustration of the rules of Logic, may be doubted; yet it\ncannot be questioned that when the authority of Aristotle was dominant\nin the schools of Europe, such applications were habitually made. And our\nargument only requires the admission, that the case is possible.\nBut the question before us has been argued upon higher grounds. Re-\ngarding Logic as a branch of Philosophy, and defining Philosophy as the\n\u201cscience of a real existence,\u201d and \u201cthe research of causes,\u201d and assigning\nas its main business the investigation of the \u201cwhy, (t\u00e4 d\u00d0oti),\u201d while Math-\nematics display only the \u201cthat, (t\u00e4 \u00e5t\u00c8),\u201d Sir W. Hamilton has contended,\nnot simply, that the superiority rests with the study of Logic, but that the\nstudy of Mathematics is at once dangerous and useless.\u2217 The pursuits of\nthe mathematician \u201chave not only not trained him to that acute scent, to\nthat delicate, almost instinctive, tact which, in the twilight of probability,\nthe search and discrimination of its finer facts demand; they have gone\nto cloud his vision, to indurate his touch, to all but the blazing light, the\n\u2217Edinburgh Review, vol. lxii. p. 409, and Letter to A. De Morgan, Esq.\nintroduction. 11\niron chain of demonstration, and left him out of the narrow confines of his\nscience, to a passive credulity in any premises, or to an absolute incredulity\nin all.\u201d In support of these and of other charges, both argument and co-\npious authority are adduced.\u2217 I shall not attempt a complete discussion\nof the topics which are suggested by these remarks. My object is not con-\ntroversy, and the observations which follow are offered not in the spirit of\nantagonism, but in the hope of contributing to the formation of just views\nupon an important subject. Of Sir W. Hamilton it is impossible to speak\notherwise than with that respect which is due to genius and learning.\nPhilosophy is then described as the science of a real existence and the\nresearch of causes. And that no doubt may rest upon the meaning of the\nword cause, it is further said, that philosophy \u201cmainly investigates the\nwhy.\u201d These definitions are common among the ancient writers. Thus\nSeneca, one of Sir W. Hamilton\u2019s authorities, Epistle lxxxviii., \u201cThe\nphilosopher seeks and knows the causes of natural things, of which the\nmathematician searches out and computes the numbers and the measures.\u201d\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that in whatever degree the belief has pre-\nvailed, that the business of philosophy is immediately with causes; in the\nsame degree has every science whose object is the investigation of laws, been\nlightly esteemed. Thus the Epistle to which we have referred, bestows, by\ncontrast with Philosophy, a separate condemnation on Music and Gram-\nmar, on Mathematics and Astronomy, although it is that of Mathematics\nonly that Sir W. Hamilton has quoted.\nNow we might take our stand upon the conviction of many thoughtful\nand reflective minds, that in the extent of the meaning above stated, Phi-\nlosophy is impossible. The business of true Science, they conclude, is with\nlaws and phenomena. The nature of Being, the mode of the operation of\nCause, the why, they hold to be beyond the reach of our intelligence. But\n\u2217The arguments are in general better than the authorities. Many writers quoted\nin condemnation of mathematics (Aristo, Seneca, Jerome, Augustine, Cornelius\nAgrippa, &c.) have borne a no less explicit testimony against other sciences, nor least of\nall, against that of logic. The treatise of the last named writer De Vanitate Scientiarum,\nmust surely have been referred to by mistake.\u2014Vide cap. cii.\nintroduction. 12\nwe do not require the vantage-ground of this position; nor is it doubted\nthat whether the aim of Philosophy is attainable or not, the desire which\nimpels us to the attempt is an instinct of our higher nature. Let it be\ngranted that the problem which has baffled the efforts of ages, is not a\nhopeless one; that the \u201cscience of a real existence,\u201d and \u201cthe research of\ncauses,\u201d \u201cthat kernel\u201d for which \u201cPhilosophy is still militant,\u201d do not tran-\nscend the limits of the human intellect. I am then compelled to assert, that\naccording to this view of the nature of Philosophy, Logic forms no part of\nit. On the principle of a true classification, we ought no longer to associate\nLogic and Metaphysics, but Logic and Mathematics.\nShould any one after what has been said, entertain a doubt upon this\npoint, I must refer him to the evidence which will be afforded in the follow-\ning Essay. He will there see Logic resting like Geometry upon axiomatic\ntruths, and its theorems constructed upon that general doctrine of symbols,\nwhich constitutes the foundation of the recognised Analysis. In the Logic\nof Aristotle he will be led to view a collection of the formul\u00e6 of the science,\nexpressed by another, but, (it is thought) less perfect scheme of symbols.\nI feel bound to contend for the absolute exactness of this parallel. It is\nno escape from the conclusion to which it points to assert, that Logic not\nonly constructs a science, but also inquires into the origin and the nature\nof its own principles,\u2014a distinction which is denied to Mathematics. \u201cIt is\nwholly beyond the domain of mathematicians,\u201d it is said, \u201cto inquire into\nthe origin and nature of their principles.\u201d\u2014Review, page 415. But upon\nwhat ground can such a distinction be maintained? What definition of the\nterm Science will be found sufficiently arbitrary to allow such differences?\nThe application of this conclusion to the question before us is clear and\ndecisive. The mental discipline which is afforded by the study of Logic, as\nan exact science, is, in species, the same as that afforded by the study of\nAnalysis.\nIs it then contended that either Logic or Mathematics can supply a\nperfect discipline to the Intellect? The most careful and unprejudiced\nexamination of this question leads me to doubt whether such a position\ncan be maintained. The exclusive claims of either must, I believe, be\nintroduction. 13\nabandoned, nor can any others, partaking of a like exclusive character, be\nadmitted in their room. It is an important observation, which has more\nthan once been made, that it is one thing to arrive at correct premises,\nand another thing to deduce logical conclusions, and that the business of\nlife depends more upon the former than upon the latter. The study of\nthe exact sciences may teach us the one, and it may give us some general\npreparation of knowledge and of practice for the attainment of the other,\nbut it is to the union of thought with action, in the field of Practical Logic,\nthe arena of Human Life, that we are to look for its fuller and more perfect\naccomplishment.\nI desire here to express my conviction, that with the advance of our\nknowledge of all true science, an ever-increasing harmony will be found to\nprevail among its separate branches. The view which leads to the rejection\nof one, ought, if consistent, to lead to the rejection of others. And indeed\nmany of the authorities which have been quoted against the study of Math-\nematics, are even more explicit in their condemnation of Logic. \u201cNatural\nscience,\u201d says the Chian Aristo, \u201cis above us, Logical science does not con-\ncern us.\u201d When such conclusions are founded (as they often are) upon a\ndeep conviction of the preeminent value and importance of the study of\nMorals, we admit the premises, but must demur to the inference. For it\nhas been well said by an ancient writer, that it is the \u201ccharacteristic of the\nliberal sciences, not that they conduct us to Virtue, but that they prepare\nus for Virtue;\u201d and Melancthon\u2019s sentiment, \u201cabeunt studia in mores,\u201d\nhas passed into a proverb. Moreover, there is a common ground upon\nwhich all sincere votaries of truth may meet, exchanging with each other\nthe language of Flamsteed\u2019s appeal to Newton, \u201cThe works of the Eternal\nProvidence will be better understood through your labors and mine.\u201d\nFIRST PRINCIPLES.\nLet us employ the symbol 1, or unity, to represent the Universe, and\nlet us understand it as comprehending every conceivable class of objects\nwhether actually existing or not, it being premised that the same individual\nmay be found in more than one class, inasmuch as it may possess more\nthan one quality in common with other individuals. Let us employ the\nletters X, Y, Z, to represent the individual members of classes, X applying\nto every member of one class, as members of that particular class, and\nY to every member of another class as members of such class, and so on,\naccording to the received language of treatises on Logic.\nFurther let us conceive a class of symbols x, y, z, possessed of the\nfollowing character.\nThe symbol x operating upon any subject comprehending individuals\nor classes, shall be supposed to select from that subject all the Xs which\nit contains. In like manner the symbol y, operating upon any subject,\nshall be supposed to select from it all individuals of the class Y which are\ncomprised in it, and so on.\nWhen no subject is expressed, we shall suppose 1 (the Universe) to be\nthe subject understood, so that we shall have\nx = x (1),\nthe meaning of either term being the selection from the Universe of all\nthe Xs which it contains, and the result of the operation being in common\nlanguage, the class X, i. e. the class of which each member is an X.\nFrom these premises it will follow, that the product xy will represent, in\nsuccession, the selection of the class Y, and the selection from the class Y\nof such individuals of the class X as are contained in it, the result being\nthe class whose members are both Xs and Ys. And in like manner the\nproduct xyz will represent a compound operation of which the successive\nelements are the selection of the class Z, the selection from it of such\nfirst principles. 15\nindividuals of the class Y as are contained in it, and the selection from the\nresult thus obtained of all the individuals of the class X which it contains,\nthe final result being the class common to X, Y, and Z.\nFrom the nature of the operation which the symbols x, y, z, are con-\nceived to represent, we shall designate them as elective symbols. An ex-\npression in which they are involved will be called an elective function, and\nan equation of which the members are elective functions, will be termed\nan elective equation.\nIt will not be necessary that we should here enter into the analysis of\nthat mental operation which we have represented by the elective symbol.\nIt is not an act of Abstraction according to the common acceptation of that\nterm, because we never lose sight of the concrete, but it may probably be\nreferred to an exercise of the faculties of Comparison and Attention. Our\npresent concern is rather with the laws of combination and of succession,\nby which its results are governed, and of these it will suffice to notice the\nfollowing.\n1st. The result of an act of election is independent of the grouping or\nclassification of the subject.\nThus it is indifferent whether from a group of objects considered as\na whole, we select the class X, or whether we divide the group into two\nparts, select the Xs from them separately, and then connect the results in\none aggregate conception.\nWe may express this law mathematically by the equation\nx(u + v) = xu + xv,\nu + v representing the undivided subject, and u and v the component parts\nof it.\n2nd. It is indifferent in what order two successive acts of election are\nperformed.\nWhether from the class of animals we select sheep, and from the sheep\nthose which are horned, or whether from the class of animals we select the\nhorned, and from these such as are sheep, the result is unaffected. In either\ncase we arrive at the class horned sheep.\nfirst principles. 16\nThe symbolical expression of this law is\nxy = yx.\n3rd. The result of a given act of election performed twice, or any number\nof times in succession, is the result of the same act performed once.\nIf from a group of objects we select the Xs, we obtain a class of which\nall the members are Xs. If we repeat the operation on this class no further\nchange will ensue: in selecting the Xs we take the whole. Thus we have\nxx = x,\nor\nx2 = x;\nand supposing the same operation to be n times performed, we have\nxn = x,\nwhich is the mathematical expression of the law above stated.\u2217\nThe laws we have established under the symbolical forms\nx(u + v) = xu + xv, (1)\nxy = yx, (2)\nxn = x, (3)\n\u2217The office of the elective symbol x, is to select individuals comprehended in the\nclass X. Let the class X be supposed to embrace the universe; then, whatever the class Y\nmay be, we have\nxy = y.\nThe office which x performs is now equivalent to the symbol +, in one at least of its\ninterpretations, and the index law (3) gives\n+n = +,\nwhich is the known property of that symbol.\nfirst principles. 17\nare sufficient for the basis of a Calculus. From the first of these, it ap-\npears that elective symbols are distributive, from the second that they are\ncommutative; properties which they possess in common with symbols of\nquantity, and in virtue of which, all the processes of common algebra are\napplicable to the present system. The one and sufficient axiom involved in\nthis application is that equivalent operations performed upon equivalent\nsubjects produce equivalent results.\u2217\nThe third law (3) we shall denominate the index law. It is peculiar to\nelective symbols, and will be found of great importance in enabling us to\nreduce our results to forms meet for interpretation.\nFrom the circumstance that the processes of algebra may be applied\nto the present system, it is not to be inferred that the interpretation of\nan elective equation will be unaffected by such processes. The expression\nof a truth cannot be negatived by a legitimate operation, but it may be\n\u2217It is generally asserted by writers on Logic, that all reasoning ultimately depends\non an application of the dictum of Aristotle, de omni et nullo. \u201cWhatever is predicated\nuniversally of any class of things, may be predicated in like manner of any thing compre-\nhended in that class.\u201d But it is agreed that this dictum is not immediately applicable\nin all cases, and that in a majority of instances, a certain previous process of reduction\nis necessary. What are the elements involved in that process of reduction? Clearly they\nare as much a part of general reasoning as the dictum itself.\nAnother mode of considering the subject resolves all reasoning into an application of\none or other of the following canons, viz.\n1. If two terms agree with one and the same third, they agree with each other.\n2. If one term agrees, and another disagrees, with one and the same third, these two\ndisagree with each other.\nBut the application of these canons depends on mental acts equivalent to those which\nare involved in the before-named process of reduction. We have to select individuals\nfrom classes, to convert propositions, &c., before we can avail ourselves of their guidance.\nAny account of the process of reasoning is insufficient, which does not represent, as well\nthe laws of the operation which the mind performs in that process, as the primary truths\nwhich it recognises and applies.\nIt is presumed that the laws in question are adequately represented by the fundamen-\ntal equations of the present Calculus. The proof of this will be found in its capability\nof expressing propositions, and of exhibiting in the results of its processes, every result\nthat may be arrived at by ordinary reasoning.\nfirst principles. 18\nlimited. The equation y = z implies that the classes Y and Z are equivalent,\nmember for member. Multiply it by a factor x, and we have\nxy = xz,\nwhich expresses that the individuals which are common to the classes\nX and Y are also common to X and Z, and vice vers\u02c6a. This is a per-\nfectly legitimate inference, but the fact which it declares is a less general\none than was asserted in the original proposition.\nOF EXPRESSION AND INTERPRETATION.\nA Proposition is a sentence which either affirms or denies, as, All men are\nmortal, No creature is independent.\nA Proposition has necessarily two terms, as men, mortal ; the former of\nwhich, or the one spoken of, is called the subject; the latter, or that which is\naffirmed or denied of the subject, the predicate. These are connected together\nby the copula is, or is not, or by some other modification of the substantive\nverb.\nThe substantive verb is the only verb recognised in Logic; all others are\nresolvable by means of the verb to be and a participle or adjective, e. g. \u201cThe\nRomans conquered\u201d; the word conquered is both copula and predicate, being\nequivalent to \u201cwere (copula) victorious\u201d (predicate).\nA Proposition must either be affirmative or negative, and must be also either\nuniversal or particular. Thus we reckon in all, four kinds of pure categorical\nPropositions.\n1st. Universal-affirmative, usually represented by A,\nEx. All Xs are Ys.\n2nd. Universal-negative, usually represented by E,\nEx. No Xs are Ys.\n3rd. Particular-affirmative, usually represented by I,\nEx. Some Xs are Ys.\n4th. Particular-negative, usually represented by O,\u2217\nEx. Some Xs are not Ys.\n\u2217The above is taken, with little variation, from the Treatises of Aldrich and Whately.\nof expression and interpretation. 20\n1. To express the class, not-X, that is, the class including all individuals\nthat are not Xs.\nThe class X and the class not-X together make the Universe. But the\nUniverse is 1, and the class X is determined by the symbol x, therefore the\nclass not-X will be determined by the symbol 1 \u2212 x.\nHence the office of the symbol 1 \u2212 x attached to a given subject will\nbe, to select from it all the not-Xs which it contains.\nAnd in like manner, as the product xy expresses the entire class whose\nmembers are both Xs and Ys, the symbol y(1 \u2212 x) will represent the class\nwhose members are Ys but not Xs, and the symbol (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) the entire\nclass whose members are neither Xs nor Ys.\n2. To express the Proposition, All Xs are Ys.\nAs all the Xs which exist are found in the class Y, it is obvious that\nto select out of the Universe all Ys, and from these to select all Xs, is the\nsame as to select at once from the Universe all Xs.\nHence\nxy = x,\nor\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (4)\n3. To express the Proposition, No Xs are Ys.\nTo assert that no Xs are Ys, is the same as to assert that there are\nno terms common to the classes X and Y. Now all individuals common\nto those classes are represented by xy. Hence the Proposition that No Xs\nare Ys, is represented by the equation\nxy = 0. (5)\n4. To express the Proposition, Some Xs are Ys.\nIf some Xs are Ys, there are some terms common to the classes X and Y.\nLet those terms constitute a separate class V, to which there shall corre-\nspond a separate elective symbol v, then\nv = xy. (6)\nof expression and interpretation. 21\nAnd as v includes all terms common to the classes X and Y, we can indif-\nferently interpret it, as Some Xs, or Some Ys.\n5. To express the Proposition, Some Xs are not Ys.\nIn the last equation write 1 \u2212 y for y, and we have\nv = x(1 \u2212 y), (7)\nthe interpretation of v being indifferently Some Xs or Some not-Ys.\nThe above equations involve the complete theory of categorical Propo-\nsitions, and so far as respects the employment of analysis for the deduction\nof logical inferences, nothing more can be desired. But it may be satisfac-\ntory to notice some particular forms deducible from the third and fourth\nequations, and susceptible of similar application.\nIf we multiply the equation (6) by x, we have\nvx = x2y = xy by (3).\nComparing with (6), we find\nv = vx,\nor\nv(1 \u2212 x) = 0. (8)\nAnd multiplying (6) by y, and reducing in a similar manner, we have\nv = vy,\nor\nv(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (9)\nComparing (8) and (9),\nvx = vy = v. (10)\nof expression and interpretation. 22\nAnd further comparing (8) and (9) with (4), we have as the equivalent\nof this system of equations the Propositions\nAll Vs are Xs\nAll Vs are Ys\n}\n.\nThe system (10) might be used to replace (6), or the single equation\nvx = vy, (11)\nmight be used, assigning to vx the interpretation, Some Xs, and to vy the\ninterpretation, Some Ys. But it will be observed that this system does not\nexpress quite so much as the single equation (6), from which it is derived.\nBoth, indeed, express the Proposition, Some Xs are Ys, but the system (10)\ndoes not imply that the class V includes all the terms that are common to\nX and Y.\nIn like manner, from the equation (7) which expresses the Proposition\nSome Xs are not Ys, we may deduce the system\nvx = v(1 \u2212 y) = v, (12)\nin which the interpretation of v(1 \u2212 y) is Some not-Ys. Since in this case\nvy = 0, we must of course be careful not to interpret vy as Some Ys.\nIf we multiply the first equation of the system (12), viz.\nvx = v(1 \u2212 y),\nby y, we have\nvxy = vy(1 \u2212 y);\n\u2234 vxy = 0, (13)\nwhich is a form that will occasionally present itself. It is not necessary to\nrevert to the primitive equation in order to interpret this, for the condition\nof expression and interpretation. 23\nthat vx represents Some Xs, shews us by virtue of (5), that its import will\nbe\nSome Xs are not Ys,\nthe subject comprising all the Xs that are found in the class V.\nUniversally in these cases, difference of form implies a difference of\ninterpretation with respect to the auxiliary symbol v, and each form is\ninterpretable by itself.\nFurther, these differences do not introduce into the Calculus a need-\nless perplexity. It will hereafter be seen that they give a precision and a\ndefiniteness to its conclusions, which could not otherwise be secured.\nFinally, we may remark that all the equations by which particular truths\nare expressed, are deducible from any one general equation, expressing\nany one general Proposition, from which those particular Propositions are\nnecessary deductions. This has been partially shewn already, but it is much\nmore fully exemplified in the following scheme.\nThe general equation\nx = y,\nimplies that the classes X and Y are equivalent, member for member; that\nevery individual belonging to the one, belongs to the other also. Multiply\nthe equation by x, and we have\nx2 = xy;\n\u2234 x = xy,\nwhich implies, by (4), that all Xs are Ys. Multiply the same equation by y,\nand we have in like manner\ny = xy;\nthe import of which is, that all Ys are Xs. Take either of these equations,\nthe latter for instance, and writing it under the form\n(1 \u2212 x)y = 0,\nof expression and interpretation. 24\nwe may regard it as an equation in which y, an unknown quantity, is sought\nto be expressed in terms of x. Now it will be shewn when we come to treat\nof the Solution of Elective Equations (and the result may here be verified\nby substitution) that the most general solution of this equation is\ny = vx,\nwhich implies that All Ys are Xs, and that Some Xs are Ys. Multiply by x,\nand we have\nvy = vx,\nwhich indifferently implies that some Ys are Xs and some Xs are Ys, being\nthe particular form at which we before arrived.\nFor convenience of reference the above and some other results have\nbeen classified in the annexed Table, the first column of which contains\npropositions, the second equations, and the third the conditions of final\ninterpretation. It is to be observed, that the auxiliary equations which are\ngiven in this column are not independent: they are implied either in the\nequations of the second column, or in the condition for the interpretation\nof v. But it has been thought better to write them separately, for greater\nease and convenience. And it is further to be borne in mind, that although\nthree different forms are given for the expression of each of the particular\npropositions, everything is really included in the first form.\nof expression and interpretation. 25\nTABLE.\nThe class X x\nThe class not-X 1 \u2212 x\nAll Xs are Ys\nAll Ys are Xs\n}\nx = y\nAll Xs are Ys x(1 \u2212 y) = 0\nNo Xs are Ys xy = 0\nAll Ys are Xs\nSome Xs are Ys\n}\ny = vx vx = Some Xs\nv(1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nNo Ys are Xs\nSome not-Xs are Ys\n}\ny = v(1 \u2212 x) v(1 \u2212 x) = some not-Xs\nvx = 0.\nSome Xs are Ys\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nv = xy\nor vx = vy\nor vx(1 \u2212 y) = 0\nv = some Xs or some Ys\nvx = some Xs, vy = some Ys\nv(1 \u2212 x) = 0, v(1 \u2212 y) = 0.\nSome Xs are not Ys\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nv = x(1 \u2212 y)\nor vx = v(1 \u2212 y)\nor vxy = 0\nv = some Xs, or some not-Ys\nvx = some Xs, v(1 \u2212 y) = some not-Ys\nv(1 \u2212 x) = 0, vy = 0.\nOF THE CONVERSION OF PROPOSITIONS.\nA Proposition is said to be converted when its terms are transposed; when\nnothing more is done, this is called simple conversion; e. g.\nNo virtuous man is a tyrant, is converted into\nNo tyrant is a virtuous man.\nLogicians also recognise conversion per accidens, or by limitation, e. g.\nAll birds are animals, is converted into\nSome animals are birds.\nAnd conversion by contraposition or negation, as\nEvery poet is a man of genius, converted into\nHe who is not a man of genius is not a poet.\nIn one of these three ways every Proposition may be illatively converted, viz.\nE and I simply, A and O by negation, A and E by limitation.\nThe primary canonical forms already determined for the expression of\nPropositions, are\nAll Xs are Ys, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0, A\nNo Xs are Ys, xy = 0, E\nSome Xs are Ys, v = xy, I\nSome Xs are not Ys, v = x(1 \u2212 y). O\nOn examining these, we perceive that E and I are symmetrical with\nrespect to x and y, so that x being changed into y, and y into x, the\nequations remain unchanged. Hence E and I may be interpreted into\nNo Ys are Xs,\nSome Ys are Xs,\nof the conversion of propositions. 27\nrespectively. Thus we have the known rule of the Logicians, that particular\naffirmative and universal negative Propositions admit of simple conversion.\nThe equations A and O may be written in the forms\n(1 \u2212 y){1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)} = 0,\nv = (1 \u2212 y){1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)}.\nNow these are precisely the forms which we should have obtained if we\nhad in those equations changed x into 1 \u2212 y, and y into 1 \u2212 x, which would\nhave represented the changing in the original Propositions of the Xs into\nnot-Ys, and the Ys into not-Xs, the resulting Propositions being\nAll not-Ys are not-Xs,\nSome not-Ys are not not-Xs. (a)\nOr we may, by simply inverting the order of the factors in the second\nmember of O, and writing it in the form\nv = (1 \u2212 y)x,\ninterpret it by I into\nSome not-Ys are Xs,\nwhich is really another form of (a). Hence follows the rule, that universal\naffirmative and particular negative Propositions admit of negative conver-\nsion, or, as it is also termed, conversion by contraposition.\nThe equations A and E, written in the forms\n(1 \u2212 y)x = 0,\nyx = 0,\ngive on solution the respective forms\nx = vy,\nx = v(1 \u2212 y),\nof the conversion of propositions. 28\nthe correctness of which may be shewn by substituting these values of x\nin the equations to which they belong, and observing that those equations\nare satisfied quite independently of the nature of the symbol v. The first\nsolution may be interpreted into\nSome Ys are Xs,\nand the second into\nSome not-Ys are Xs.\nFrom which it appears that universal-affirmative, and universal-negative\nPropositions are convertible by limitation, or, as it has been termed, per\naccidens.\nThe above are the laws of Conversion recognized by Abp. Whately.\nWriters differ however as to the admissibility of negative conversion. The\nquestion depends on whether we will consent to use such terms as not-\nX, not-Y. Agreeing with those who think that such terms ought to be\nadmitted, even although they change the kind of the Proposition, I am\nconstrained to observe that the present classification of them is faulty and\ndefective. Thus the conversion of No Xs are Ys, into All Ys are not-Xs,\nthough perfectly legitimate, is not recognised in the above scheme. It may\ntherefore be proper to examine the subject somewhat more fully.\nShould we endeavour, from the system of equations we have obtained,\nto deduce the laws not only of the conversion, but also of the general\ntransformation of propositions, we should be led to recognise the following\ndistinct elements, each connected with a distinct mathematical process.\n1st. The negation of a term, i. e. the changing of X into not-X, or not-X\ninto X.\n2nd. The translation of a Proposition from one kind to another, as if\nwe should change\nAll Xs are Ys into Some Xs are Ys, A into I\nwhich would be lawful; or\nAll Xs are Ys into No Xs are Ys, A into E\nof the conversion of propositions. 29\nwhich would be unlawful.\n3rd. The simple conversion of a Proposition.\nThe conditions in obedience to which these processes may lawfully be\nperformed, may be deduced from the equations by which Propositions are\nexpressed.\nWe have\nAll Xs are Ys, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0, A\nNo Xs are Ys, xy = 0. E\nWrite E in the form\nx{1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 y)} = 0,\nand it is interpretable by A into\nAll Xs are not-Ys,\nso that we may change\nNo Xs are Ys into All Xs are not-Ys.\nIn like manner A interpreted by E gives\nNo Xs are not-Ys,\nso that we may change\nAll Xs are Ys into No Xs are not-Ys.\nFrom these cases we have the following Rule: A universal-affirmative\nProposition is convertible into a universal-negative, and, vice vers\u02c6a, by\nnegation of the predicate.\nAgain, we have\nSome Xs are Ys, v = xy,\nSome Xs are not Ys, v = x(1 \u2212 y).\nof the conversion of propositions. 30\nThese equations only differ from those last considered by the presence of\nthe term v. The same reasoning therefore applies, and we have the Rule\u2014\nA particular-affirmative proposition is convertible into a particular-\nnegative, and vice vers\u02c6a, by negation of the predicate.\nAssuming the universal Propositions\nAll Xs are Ys, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nNo Xs are Ys, xy = 0.\nMultiplying by v, we find\nvx(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nvxy = 0,\nwhich are interpretable into\nSome Xs are Ys, I\nSome Xs are not Ys. O\nHence a universal-affirmative is convertible into a particular-affirmative,\nand a universal-negative into a particular-negative without negation of sub-\nject or predicate.\nCombining the above with the already proved rule of simple conversion,\nwe arrive at the following system of independent laws of transformation.\n1st. An affirmative Proposition may be changed into its corresponding\nnegative (A into E, or I into O), and vice vers\u02c6a, by negation of the predicate.\n2nd. A universal Proposition may be changed into its corresponding\nparticular Proposition, (A into I, or E into O).\n3rd. In a particular-affirmative, or universal-negative Proposition, the\nterms may be mutually converted.\nWherein negation of a term is the changing of X into not-X, and vice\nvers\u02c6a, and is not to be understood as affecting the kind of the Proposition.\nof the conversion of propositions. 31\nEvery lawful transformation is reducible to the above rules. Thus we\nhave\nAll Xs are Ys,\nNo Xs are not-Ys by 1st rule,\nNo not-Ys are Xs by 3rd rule,\nAll not-Ys are not-Xs by 1st rule,\nwhich is an example of negative conversion. Again,\nNo Xs are Ys,\nNo Ys are Xs 3rd rule,\nAll Ys are not-Xs 1st rule,\nwhich is the case already deduced.\nOF SYLLOGISMS.\nA Syllogism consists of three Propositions, the last of which, called the con-\nclusion, is a logical consequence of the two former, called the premises; e. g.\nPremises,\n{All Ys are Xs.\nAll Zs are Ys.\nConclusion, All Zs are Xs.\nEvery syllogism has three and only three terms, whereof that which is the\nsubject of the conclusion is called the minor term, the predicate of the conclu-\nsion, the major term, and the remaining term common to both premises, the\nmiddle term. Thus, in the above formula, Z is the minor term, X the major\nterm, Y the middle term.\nThe figure of a syllogism consists in the situation of the middle term with\nrespect to the terms of the conclusion. The varieties of figure are exhibited in\nthe annexed scheme.\n1st Fig. 2nd Fig. 3rd Fig. 4th Fig.\nYX XY YX XY\nZY ZY YZ YZ\nZX ZX ZX ZX\nWhen we designate the three propositions of a syllogism by their usual sym-\nbols (A, E, I, O), and in their actual order, we are said to determine the mood\nof the syllogism. Thus the syllogism given above, by way of illustration, belongs\nto the mood AAA in the first figure.\nThe moods of all syllogisms commonly received as valid, are represented by\nthe vowels in the following mnemonic verses.\nFig. 1.\u2014bArbArA, cElArEnt, dArII, fErIO que prioris.\nFig. 2.\u2014cEsArE, cAmEstrEs, fEstInO, bArOkO, secund\u00e6.\nFig. 3.\u2014Tertia dArAptI, dIsAmIs, dAtIsI, fElAptOn,\nbOkArdO, fErIsO, habet: quarta insuper addit.\nof syllogisms. 33\nFig. 4.\u2014brAmAntIp, cAmEnEs, dImArIs, fEsApO, frEsIsOn.\nThe equation by which we express any Proposition concerning the\nclasses X and Y, is an equation between the symbols x and y, and the equa-\ntion by which we express any Proposition concerning the classes Y and Z,\nis an equation between the symbols y and z. If from two such equations\nwe eliminate y, the result, if it do not vanish, will be an equation between\nx and z, and will be interpretable into a Proposition concerning the classes\nX and Z. And it will then constitute the third member, or Conclusion, of\na Syllogism, of which the two given Propositions are the premises.\nThe result of the elimination of y from the equations\nay + b = 0,\na\u2032y + b\u2032 = 0, (14)\nis the equation\nab\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032b = 0. (15)\nNow the equations of Propositions being of the first order with reference\nto each of the variables involved, all the cases of elimination which we shall\nhave to consider, will be reducible to the above case, the constants a, b,\na\u2032, b\u2032, being replaced by functions of x, z, and the auxiliary symbol v.\nAs to the choice of equations for the expression of our premises, the\nonly restriction is, that the equations must not both be of the form ay = 0,\nfor in such cases elimination would be impossible. When both equations\nare of this form, it is necessary to solve one of them, and it is indifferent\nwhich we choose for this purpose. If that which we select is of the form\nxy = 0, its solution is\ny = v(1 \u2212 x), (16)\nif of the form (1 \u2212 x)y = 0, the solution will be\ny = vx, (17)\nand these are the only cases which can arise. The reason of this exception\nwill appear in the sequel.\nof syllogisms. 34\nFor the sake of uniformity we shall, in the expression of particular\npropositions, confine ourselves to the forms\nvx = vy, Some Xs are Ys,\nvx = v(1 \u2212 y), Some Xs are not Ys.\nThese have a closer analogy with (16) and (17), than the other forms which\nmight be used.\nBetween the forms about to be developed, and the Aristotelian canons,\nsome points of difference will occasionally be observed, of which it may be\nproper to forewarn the reader.\nTo the right understanding of these it is proper to remark, that the\nessential structure of a Syllogism is, in some measure, arbitrary. Supposing\nthe order of the premises to be fixed, and the distinction of the major and\nthe minor term to be thereby determined, it is purely a matter of choice\nwhich of the two shall have precedence in the Conclusion. Logicians have\nsettled this question in favour of the minor term, but it is clear, that this\nis a convention. Had it been agreed that the major term should have the\nfirst place in the conclusion, a logical scheme might have been constructed,\nless convenient in some cases than the existing one, but superior in others.\nWhat it lost in barbara, it would gain in bramantip. Convenience is perhaps\nin favour of the adopted arrangement,\u2217 but it is to be remembered that it\nis merely an arrangement.\nNow the method we shall exhibit, not having reference to one scheme\nof arrangement more than to another, will always give the more general\nconclusion, regard being paid only to its abstract lawfulness, considered\nas a result of pure reasoning. And therefore we shall sometimes have pre-\nsented to us the spectacle of conclusions, which a logician would pronounce\ninformal, but never of such as a reasoning being would account false.\nThe Aristotelian canons, however, beside restricting the order of the\nterms of a conclusion, limit their nature also;\u2014and this limitation is of\n\u2217The contrary view was maintained by Hobbes. The question is very fairly discussed\nin Hallam\u2019s Introduction to the Literature of Europe, vol. iii. p. 309. In the rhetorical\nuse of Syllogism, the advantage appears to rest with the rejected form.\nof syllogisms. 35\nmore consequence than the former. We may, by a change of figure, replace\nthe particular conclusion of bramantip by the general conclusion of barbara;\nbut we cannot thus reduce to rule such inferences, as\nSome not-Xs are not Ys.\nYet there are cases in which such inferences may lawfully be drawn,\nand in unrestricted argument they are of frequent occurrence. Now if an\ninference of this, or of any other kind, is lawful in itself, it will be exhibited\nin the results of our method.\nWe may by restricting the canon of interpretation confine our expressed\nresults within the limits of the scholastic logic; but this would only be\nto restrict ourselves to the use of a part of the conclusions to which our\nanalysis entitles us.\nThe classification we shall adopt will be purely mathematical, and we\nshall afterwards consider the logical arrangement to which it corresponds.\nIt will be sufficient, for reference, to name the premises and the Figure in\nwhich they are found.\nClass 1st.\u2014Forms in which v does not enter.\nThose which admit of an inference are AA, EA, Fig. 1; AE, EA, Fig. 2;\nAA, AE, Fig. 4.\nEx. AA, Fig. 1, and, by mutation of premises (change of order),\nAA, Fig. 4.\nAll Ys are Xs, y(1 \u2212 x) = 0, or (1 \u2212 x)y = 0,\nAll Zs are Ys, z(1 \u2212 y) = 0, or zy \u2212 z = 0.\nEliminating y by (13) we have\nz(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\n\u2234 All Zs are Xs.\nA convenient mode of effecting the elimination, is to write the equation\nof the premises, so that y shall appear only as a factor of one member\nof syllogisms. 36\nin the first equation, and only as a factor of the opposite member in the\nsecond equation, and then to multiply the equations, omitting the y. This\nmethod we shall adopt.\nEx.

Thus, AE (fig. 1) is resolvable by fesapo (fig. 4), or by ferio (fig. 1).\nAristotle and his followers rejected the fourth figure as only a modification of the first,\nbut this being a mere question of form, either scheme may be termed Aristotelian.\nof syllogisms. 37\nThe reason why we cannot interpret vzx = 0 into Some Zs are not-Xs,\nis that by the very terms of the first equation (a) the interpretation of vx\nis fixed, as Some Xs; v is regarded as the representative of Some, only with\nreference to the class X.\nFor the reason of our employing a solution of one of the primitive equa-\ntions, see the remarks on (16) and (17). Had we solved the second equation\ninstead of the first, we should have had\n(1 \u2212 x)y = 0,\nv(1 \u2212 z) = y, (a)\nv(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 x) = 0, (b)\n\u2234 Some not-Zs are Xs.\nHere it is to be observed, that the second equation (a) fixes the meaning\nof v(1 \u2212 z), as Some not-Zs. The full meaning of the result (b) is, that all\nthe not-Zs which are found in the class Y are found in the class X, and it\nis evident that this could not have been expressed in any other way.\nEx. 2.

The equation (a), it is seen, defines vz as Some Zs, but\nit does not define v(1 \u2212 z), so that we might stop at the result of elimina-\ntion (b), and content ourselves with saying, that it is not interpretable into\na relation between the classes X and Z.\nTake as a second example AI, Fig. 2, and, by mutation, IA, Fig. 2.\nAll Xs are Ys, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nSome Zs are Ys, vz = vy,\nx = xy,\nvy = vz,\nvx = vxz,\nv(1 \u2212 z)x = 0,\n0 = 0,\nthe auxiliary equation in this case being v(1 \u2212 z) = 0.\nIndeed in every case in this class, in which no inference is possible, the\nresult of elimination is reducible to the form 0 = 0. Examples therefore\nneed not be multiplied.\nClass 4th.\u2014When v enters into both equations.\nNo inference is possible in any case, but there exists a distinction among\nthe unlawful cases which is peculiar to this class. The two divisions are,\nof syllogisms. 40\n1st. When the result of elimination is reducible by the auxiliary equa-\ntions to the form 0 = 0. The cases are II, OI, Fig. 1; II, OO, Fig. 2; II, IO,\nOI, OO, Fig. 3; II, IO, Fig. 4.\n2nd. When the result of elimination is not reducible by the auxiliary\nequations to the form 0 = 0.\nThe cases are IO, OO, Fig. 1; IO, OI, Fig. 2; OI, OO, Fig. 4.\nLet us take as an example of the former case, II, Fig. 3.\nSome Xs are Ys, vx = vy,\nSome Zs are Ys, v\u2032z = v\u2032y,\nvx = vy,\nv\u2032y = v\u2032z,\nvv\u2032x = vv\u2032z.\nNow the auxiliary equations v(1 \u2212 x) = 0, v\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = 0, give\nvx = v, v\u2032z = v\u2032.\nSubstituting we have\nvv\u2032 = vv\u2032,\n\u2234 0 = 0.\nAs an example of the latter case, let us take IO, Fig. 1.\nSome Ys are Xs, vy = vx,\nSome Zs are not Ys, v\u2032z = v\u2032(1 \u2212 y),\nvy = vx,\nv\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = v\u2032y,\nvv\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = vv\u2032x.\nNow the auxiliary equations being v(1\u2212x) = 0, v\u2032(1\u2212z) = 0, the above\nreduces to vv\u2032 = 0. It is to this form that all similar cases are reducible.\nIts interpretation is, that the classes v and v\u2032 have no common member, as\nis indeed evident.\nThe above classification is purely founded on mathematical distinctions.\nWe shall now inquire what is the logical division to which it corresponds.\nof syllogisms. 41\nThe lawful cases of the first class comprehend all those in which, from\ntwo universal premises, a universal conclusion may be drawn. We see that\nthey include the premises of barbara and celarent in the first figure, of\ncesare and camestres in the second, and of bramantip and camenes in the\nfourth. The premises of bramantip are included, because they admit of an\nuniversal conclusion, although not in the same figure.\nThe lawful cases of the second class are those in which a particular\nconclusion only is deducible from two universal premises.\nThe lawful cases of the third class are those in which a conclusion\nis deducible from two premises, one of which is universal and the other\nparticular.\nThe fourth class has no lawful cases.\nAmong the cases in which no inference of any kind is possible, we find\nsix in the fourth class distinguishable from the others by the circumstance,\nthat the result of elimination does not assume the form 0 = 0. The cases\nare\n{Some Ys are Xs,\nSome Zs are not Ys,\n} {Some Ys are not Xs,\nSome Zs are not Ys,\n} {Some Xs are Ys,\nSome Zs are not Ys,\n}\nand the three others which are obtained by mutation of premises.\nIt might be presumed that some logical peculiarity would be found to\nanswer to the mathematical peculiarity which we have noticed, and in fact\nthere exists a very remarkable one. If we examine each pair of premises\nin the above scheme, we shall find that there is virtually no middle term,\ni. e. no medium of comparison, in any of them. Thus, in the first example,\nthe individuals spoken of in the first premiss are asserted to belong to the\nclass Y, but those spoken of in the second premiss are virtually asserted\nto belong to the class not-Y: nor can we by any lawful transformation or\nconversion alter this state of things. The comparison will still be made\nwith the class Y in one premiss, and with the class not-Y in the other.\nNow in every case beside the above six, there will be found a middle\nterm, either expressed or implied. I select two of the most difficult cases.\nof syllogisms. 42\nIn AO, Fig. 1, viz.\nAll Ys are Xs,\nSome Zs are not Ys,\nwe have, by negative conversion of the first premiss,\nAll not-Xs are not-Ys,\nSome Zs are not Ys,\nand the middle term is now seen to be not-Y.\nAgain, in EO, Fig. 1,\nNo Ys are Xs,\nSome Zs are not Ys,\na proved conversion of the first premiss (see Conversion of Propositions),\ngives\nAll Xs are not-Ys,\nSome Zs are not-Ys,\nand the middle term, the true medium of comparison, is plainly not-Y,\nalthough as the not-Ys in the one premiss may be different from those in\nthe other, no conclusion can be drawn.\nThe mathematical condition in question, therefore,\u2014the irreducibility\nof the final equation to the form 0 = 0,\u2014adequately represents the logical\ncondition of there being no middle term, or common medium of compari-\nson, in the given premises.\nI am not aware that the distinction occasioned by the presence or ab-\nsence of a middle term, in the strict sense here understood, has been noticed\nby logicians before. The distinction, though real and deserving attention,\nis indeed by no means an obvious one, and it would have been unnoticed in\nthe present instance but for the peculiarity of its mathematical expression.\nof syllogisms. 43\nWhat appears to be novel in the above case is the proof of the existence\nof combinations of premises in which there is absolutely no medium of com-\nparison. When such a medium of comparison, or true middle term, does\nexist, the condition that its quantification in both premises together shall\nexceed its quantification as a single whole, has been ably and clearly shewn\nby Professor De Morgan to be necessary to lawful inference (Cambridge\nMemoirs, Vol. viii. Part 3). And this is undoubtedly the true principle of\nthe Syllogism, viewed from the standing-point of Arithmetic.\nI have said that it would be possible to impose conditions of interpre-\ntation which should restrict the results of this calculus to the Aristotelian\nforms. Those conditions would be,\n1st. That we should agree not to interpret the forms v(1 \u2212 x), v(1 \u2212 z).\n2ndly. That we should agree to reject every interpretation in which the\norder of the terms should violate the Aristotelian rule.\nOr, instead of the second condition, it might be agreed that, the con-\nclusion being determined, the order of the premises should, if necessary, be\nchanged, so as to make the syllogism formal.\nFrom the general character of the system it is indeed plain, that it may\nbe made to represent any conceivable scheme of logic, by imposing the\nconditions proper to the case contemplated.\nWe have found it, in a certain class of cases, to be necessary to replace\nthe two equations expressive of universal Propositions, by their solutions;\nand it may be proper to remark, that it would have been allowable in all\ninstances to have done this,\u2217 so that every case of the Syllogism, without\n\u2217It may be satisfactory to illustrate this statement by an example. In barbara, we\nshould have\nAll Ys are Xs,\nAll Zs are Ys,\ny = vx,\nz = v\u2032y,\nz = vv\u2032x,\n\u2234 All Zs are Xs.\nOr, we may multiply the resulting equation by 1 \u2212 x, which gives\nz(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nof syllogisms. 44\nwhence the same conclusion, All Zs are Xs.\nSome additional examples of the application of the system of equations in the text to\nthe demonstration of general theorems, may not be inappropriate.\nLet y be the term to be eliminated, and let x stand indifferently for either of the other\nsymbols, then each of the equations of the premises of any given syllogism may be put\nin the form\nay + bx = 0, (\u03b1)\nif the premiss is affirmative, and in the form\nay + b(1 \u2212 x) = 0, (\u03b2)\nif it is negative, a and b being either constant, or of the form \u00b1v. To prove this in detail,\nlet us examine each kind of proposition, making y successively subject and predicate.\nA, All Ys are Xs, y \u2212 vx = 0, (\u03b3)\nAll Xs are Ys, x \u2212 vy = 0, (\u03b4)\nE, No Ys are Xs, xy = 0,\nNo Xs are Ys, y \u2212 v(1 \u2212 x) = 0, (\u03b5)\nI, Some Xs are Ys,\nSome Ys are Xs, vx \u2212 vy = 0, (\u03b6)\nO, Some Ys are not Xs, vy \u2212 v(1 \u2212 x) = 0, (\u03b7)\nSome Xs are not Ys, vx = v(1 \u2212 y),\n\u2234 vy \u2212 v(1 \u2212 x) = 0. (\u03b8)\nThe affirmative equations (\u03b3), (\u03b4) and (\u03b6), belong to (\u03b1), and the negative equations\n(\u03b5), (\u03b7) and (\u03b8), to (\u03b2). It is seen that the two last negative equations are alike, but\nthere is a difference of interpretation. In the former\nv(1 \u2212 x) = Some not-Xs,\nin the latter,\nv(1 \u2212 x) = 0.\nThe utility of the two general forms of reference, (\u03b1) and (\u03b2), will appear from the\nfollowing application.\n1st. A conclusion drawn from two affirmative propositions is itself affirmative.\nBy (\u03b1) we have for the given propositions,\nay + bx = 0,\na\u2032y + b\u2032z = 0,\nof syllogisms. 45\nexception, might have been treated by equations comprised in the general\nand eliminating\nab\u2032z \u2212 a\u2032bx = 0,\nwhich is of the form (\u03b1). Hence, if there is a conclusion, it is affirmative.\n2nd. A conclusion drawn from an affirmative and a negative proposition is negative.\nBy (\u03b1) and (\u03b2), we have for the given propositions\nay + bx = 0,\na\u2032y + b\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\n\u2234 a\u2032bx \u2212 ab\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\nwhich is of the form (\u03b2). Hence the conclusion, if there is one, is negative.\n3rd. A conclusion drawn from two negative premises will involve a negation, (not-X,\nnot-Z) in both subject and predicate, and will therefore be inadmissible in the Aristotelian\nsystem, though just in itself.\nFor the premises being\nay + b(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\na\u2032y + b\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\nthe conclusion will be\nab\u2032(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 a\u2032b(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nwhich is only interpretable into a proposition that has a negation in each term.\n4th. Taking into account those syllogisms only, in which the conclusion is the most\ngeneral, that can be deduced from the premises,\u2014if, in an Aristotelian syllogism, the\nminor premises be changed in quality (from affirmative to negative or from negative to\naffirmative), whether it be changed in quantity or not, no conclusion will be deducible\nin the same figure.\nAn Aristotelian proposition does not admit a term of the form not-Z in the subject,\u2014\nNow on changing the quantity of the minor proposition of a syllogism, we transfer it\nfrom the general form\nay + bz = 0,\nto the general form\na\u2032y + b\u2032(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\nof syllogisms. 46\nforms\ny = vx, or y \u2212 vx = 0, A\ny = v(1 \u2212 x), or y + vx \u2212 v = 0, E\nvy = vx, vy \u2212 vx = 0, I\nvy = v(1 \u2212 x), vy + vx \u2212 v = 0. O\nPerhaps the system we have actually employed is better, as distinguish-\ning the cases in which v only may be employed, from those in which it must.\nBut for the demonstration of certain general properties of the Syllogism,\nthe above system is, from its simplicity, and from the mutual analogy of\nits forms, very convenient. We shall apply it to the following theorem.\u2217\nsee (\u03b1) and (\u03b2), or vice vers\u02c6a. And therefore, in the equation of the conclusion, there\nwill be a change from z to 1 \u2212 z, or vice vers\u02c6a. But this is equivalent to the change\nof Z into not-Z, or not-Z into Z. Now the subject of the original conclusion must have\ninvolved a Z and not a not-Z, therefore the subject of the new conclusion will involve\na not-Z, and the conclusion will not be admissible in the Aristotelian forms, except by\nconversion, which would render necessary a change of Figure.\nNow the conclusions of this calculus are always the most general that can be drawn,\nand therefore the above demonstration must not be supposed to extend to a syllogism,\nin which a particular conclusion is deduced, when a universal one is possible. This is the\ncase with bramantip only, among the Aristotelian forms, and therefore the transforma-\ntion of bramantip into camenes, and vice vers\u02c6a, is the case of restriction contemplated\nin the preliminary statement of the theorem.\n5th. If for the minor premiss of an Aristotelian syllogism, we substitute its contra-\ndictory, no conclusion is deducible in the same figure.\nIt is here only necessary to examine the case of bramantip, all the others being deter-\nmined by the last proposition.\nOn changing the minor of bramantip to its contradictory, we have AO, Fig. 4, and\nthis admits of no legitimate inference.\nHence the theorem is true without exception. Many other general theorems may in\nlike manner be proved.\n\u2217This elegant theorem was communicated by the Rev. Charles Graves, Fellow and\nProfessor of Mathematics in Trinity College, Dublin, to whom the Author desires further\nto record his grateful acknowledgments for a very judicious examination of the former\nportion of this work, and for some new applications of the method. The following\nof syllogisms. 47\nGiven the three propositions of a Syllogism, prove that there is but\none order in which they can be legitimately arranged, and determine that\norder.\nAll the forms above given for the expression of propositions, are par-\nticular cases of the general form,\na + bx + cy = 0.\nAssume then for the premises of the given syllogism, the equations\na + bx + cy = 0, (18)\na\u2032 + b\u2032z + c\u2032y = 0, (19)\nthen, eliminating y, we shall have for the conclusion\nac\u2032 \u2212 a\u2032c + bc\u2032x \u2212 b\u2032cz = 0. (20)\nNow taking this as one of our premises, and either of the original equa-\ntions, suppose (18), as the other, if by elimination of a common term x,\nexample of Reduction ad impossibile is among the number:\nReducend Mood, All Xs are Ys, 1 \u2212 y = v\u2032(1 \u2212 x),\nbaroko Some Zs are not Ys, vz = v(1 \u2212 y),\nSome Zs are not Xs, vz = vv\u2032(1 \u2212 x),\nReduct Mood, All Xs are Ys, 1 \u2212 y = v\u2032(1 \u2212 x),\nbarbara All Zs are Xs, z(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nAll Zs are Ys, z(1 \u2212 y) = 0.\nThe conclusion of the reduct mood is seen to be the contradictory of the suppressed\nminor premiss. Whence, &c. It may just be remarked that the mathematical test of\ncontradictory propositions is, that on eliminating one elective symbol between their\nequations, the other elective symbol vanishes. The ostensive reduction of baroko and\nbokardo involves no difficulty.\nProfessor Graves suggests the employment of the equation x = vy for the primary\nexpression of the Proposition All Xs are Ys, and remarks, that on multiplying both\nmembers by 1 \u2212 y, we obtain x(1 \u2212 y) = 0, the equation from which we set out in the\ntext, and of which the previous one is a solution.\nof syllogisms. 48\nbetween them, we can obtain a result equivalent to the remaining pre-\nmiss (19), it will appear that there are more than one order in which the\nPropositions may be lawfully written; but if otherwise, one arrangement\nonly is lawful.\nEffecting then the elimination, we have\nbc(a\u2032 + b\u2032z + c\u2032y) = 0, (21)\nwhich is equivalent to (19) multiplied by a factor bc. Now on examining\nthe value of this factor in the equations A, E, I, O, we find it in each case\nto be v or \u2212v. But it is evident, that if an equation expressing a given\nProposition be multiplied by an extraneous factor, derived from another\nequation, its interpretation will either be limited or rendered impossible.\nThus there will either be no result at all, or the result will be a limitation\nof the remaining Proposition.\nIf, however, one of the original equations were\nx = y, or x \u2212 y = 0,\nthe factor bc would be \u22121, and would not limit the interpretation of the\nother premiss. Hence if the first member of a syllogism should be un-\nderstood to represent the double proposition All Xs are Ys, and All Ys\nare Xs, it would be indifferent in what order the remaining Propositions\nwere written.\nA more general form of the above investigation would be, to express\nthe premises by the equations\na + bx + cy + dxy = 0, (22)\na\u2032 + b\u2032z + c\u2032y + d\u2032zy = 0. (23)\nAfter the double elimination of y and x we should find\n(bc \u2212 ad)(a\u2032 + b\u2032z + c\u2032y + d\u2032zy) = 0;\nand it would be seen that the factor bc\u2212ad must in every case either vanish\nor express a limitation of meaning.\nThe determination of the order of the Propositions is sufficiently obvi-\nous.\nOF HYPOTHETICALS.\nA hypothetical Proposition is defined to be two or more categoricals united\nby a copula (or conjunction), and the different kinds of hypothetical Propositions\nare named from their respective conjunctions, viz. conditional (if), disjunctive\n(either, or), &c.\nIn conditionals, that categorical Proposition from which the other results is\ncalled the antecedent, that which results from it the consequent.\nOf the conditional syllogism there are two, and only two formul\u00e6.\n1st. The constructive,\nIf A is B, then C is D,\nBut A is B, therefore C is D.\n2nd. The Destructive,\nIf A is B, then C is D,\nBut C is not D, therefore A is not B.\nA dilemma is a complex conditional syllogism, with several antecedents in\nthe major, and a disjunctive minor.\nIf we examine either of the forms of conditional syllogism above given,\nwe shall see that the validity of the argument does not depend upon any\nconsiderations which have reference to the terms A, B, C, D, considered\nas the representatives of individuals or of classes. We may, in fact, repre-\nsent the Propositions A is B, C is D, by the arbitrary symbols X and Y\nrespectively, and express our syllogisms in such forms as the following:\nIf X is true, then Y is true,\nBut X is true, therefore Y is true.\nThus, what we have to consider is not objects and classes of objects,\nbut the truths of Propositions, namely, of those elementary Propositions\nwhich are embodied in the terms of our hypothetical premises.\nof hypotheticals. 50\nTo the symbols X, Y, Z, representative of Propositions, we may appro-\npriate the elective symbols x, y, z, in the following sense.\nThe hypothetical Universe, 1, shall comprehend all conceivable cases\nand conjunctures of circumstances.\nThe elective symbol x attached to any subject expressive of such cases\nshall select those cases in which the Proposition X is true, and similarly\nfor Y and Z.\nIf we confine ourselves to the contemplation of a given proposition X,\nand hold in abeyance every other consideration, then two cases only are\nconceivable, viz. first that the given Proposition is true, and secondly that it\nis false.\u2217 As these cases together make up the Universe of the Proposition,\nand as the former is determined by the elective symbol x, the latter is\ndetermined by the symbol 1 \u2212 x.\nBut if other considerations are admitted, each of these cases will be\nresolvable into others, individually less extensive, the number of which will\ndepend upon the number of foreign considerations admitted. Thus if we\nassociate the Propositions X and Y, the total number of conceivable cases\n\u2217It was upon the obvious principle that a Proposition is either true or false, that\nthe Stoics, applying it to assertions respecting future events, endeavoured to establish\nthe doctrine of Fate. It has been replied to their argument, that it involves \u201can abuse of\nthe word true, the precise meaning of which is id quod res est. An assertion respecting\nthe future is neither true nor false.\u201d\u2014Copleston on Necessity and Predestination, p. 36.\nWere the Stoic axiom, however, presented under the form, It is either certain that a\ngiven event will take place, or certain that it will not; the above reply would fail to meet\nthe difficulty. The proper answer would be, that no merely verbal definition can settle\nthe question, what is the actual course and constitution of Nature. When we affirm\nthat it is either certain that an event will take place, or certain that it will not take\nplace, we tacitly assume that the order of events is necessary, that the Future is but\nan evolution of the Present; so that the state of things which is, completely determines\nthat which shall be. But this (at least as respects the conduct of moral agents) is the\nvery question at issue. Exhibited under its proper form, the Stoic reasoning does not\ninvolve an abuse of terms, but a petitio principii.\nIt should be added, that enlightened advocates of the doctrine of Necessity in the\npresent day, viewing the end as appointed only in and through the means, justly repu-\ndiate those practical ill consequences which are the reproach of Fatalism.\nof hypotheticals. 51\nwill be found as exhibited in the following scheme.\nCases. Elective expressions.\n1st X true, Y true, xy,\n2nd X true, Y false, x(1 \u2212 y),\n3rd X false, Y true, (1 \u2212 x)y,\n4th X false, Y false, (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y). (24)\nIf we add the elective expressions for the two first of the above cases the\nsum is x, which is the elective symbol appropriate to the more general case\nof X being true independently of any consideration of Y; and if we add the\nelective expressions in the two last cases together, the result is 1 \u2212 x, which\nis the elective expression appropriate to the more general case of X being\nfalse.\nThus the extent of the hypothetical Universe does not at all depend\nupon the number of circumstances which are taken into account. And it\nis to be noted that however few or many those circumstances may be, the\nsum of the elective expressions representing every conceivable case will be\nunity. Thus let us consider the three Propositions, X, It rains, Y, It hails,\nZ, It freezes. The possible cases are the following:\nCases. Elective expressions.\n1st It rains, hails, and freezes, xyz,\n2nd It rains and hails, but does not freeze, xy(1 \u2212 z),\n3rd It rains and freezes, but does not hail, xz(1 \u2212 y),\n4th It freezes and hails, but does not rain, yz(1 \u2212 x),\n5th It rains, but neither hails nor freezes, x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z),\n6th It hails, but neither rains nor freezes, y(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z),\n7th It freezes, but neither hails nor rains, z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y),\n8th It neither rains, hails, nor freezes, (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z),\n1 = sum.\nof hypotheticals. 52\nExpression of Hypothetical Propositions.\nTo express that a given Proposition X is true.\nThe symbol 1\u2212x selects those cases in which the Proposition X is false.\nBut if the Proposition is true, there are no such cases in its hypothetical\nUniverse, therefore\n1 \u2212 x = 0,\nor\nx = 1. (25)\nTo express that a given Proposition X is false.\nThe elective symbol x selects all those cases in which the Proposition\nis true, and therefore if the Proposition is false,\nx = 0. (26)\nAnd in every case, having determined the elective expression appro-\npriate to a given Proposition, we assert the truth of that Proposition by\nequating the elective expression to unity, and its falsehood by equating the\nsame expression to 0.\nTo express that two Propositions, X and Y, are simultaneously true.\nThe elective symbol appropriate to this case is xy, therefore the equa-\ntion sought is\nxy = 1. (27)\nTo express that two Propositions, X and Y, are simultaneously false.\nThe condition will obviously be\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 1,\nor\nx + y \u2212 xy = 0. (28)\nof hypotheticals. 53\nTo express that either the Proposition X is true, or the Proposition Y\nis true.\nTo assert that either one or the other of two Propositions is true, is\nto assert that it is not true, that they are both false. Now the elective\nexpression appropriate to their both being false is (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y), therefore\nthe equation required is\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nor\nx + y \u2212 xy = 1. (29)\nAnd, by indirect considerations of this kind, may every disjunctive\nProposition, however numerous its members, be expressed. But the fol-\nlowing general Rule will usually be preferable.\nRule. Consider what are those distinct and mutually exclusive cases\nof which it is implied in the statement of the given Proposition, that some\none of them is true, and equate the sum of their elective expressions to\nunity. This will give the equation of the given Proposition.\nFor the sum of the elective expressions for all distinct conceivable cases\nwill be unity. Now all these cases being mutually exclusive, and it being\nasserted in the given Proposition that some one case out of a given set of\nthem is true, it follows that all which are not included in that set are false,\nand that their elective expressions are severally equal to 0. Hence the sum\nof the elective expressions for the remaining cases, viz. those included in\nthe given set, will be unity. Some one of those cases will therefore be true,\nand as they are mutually exclusive, it is impossible that more than one\nshould be true. Whence the Rule in question.\nAnd in the application of this Rule it is to be observed, that if the\ncases contemplated in the given disjunctive Proposition are not mutually\nexclusive, they must be resolved into an equivalent series of cases which\nare mutually exclusive.\nof hypotheticals. 54\nThus, if we take the Proposition of the preceding example, viz. Either\nX is true, or Y is true, and assume that the two members of this Proposition\nare not exclusive, insomuch that in the enumeration of possible cases, we\nmust reckon that of the Propositions X and Y being both true, then the\nmutually exclusive cases which fill up the Universe of the Proposition, with\ntheir elective expressions, are\n1st, X true and Y false, x(1 \u2212 y),\n2nd, Y true and X false, y(1 \u2212 x),\n3rd, X true and Y true, xy,\nand the sum of these elective expressions equated to unity gives\nx + y \u2212 xy = 1, (30)\nas before. But if we suppose the members of the disjunctive Proposition\nto be exclusive, then the only cases to be considered are\n1st, X true, Y false, x(1 \u2212 y),\n2nd, Y true, X false, y(1 \u2212 x),\nand the sum of these elective expressions equated to 0, gives\nx \u2212 2xy + y = 1. (31)\nThe subjoined examples will further illustrate this method.\nTo express the Proposition, Either X is not true, or Y is not true, the\nmembers being exclusive.\nThe mutually exclusive cases are\n1st, X not true, Y true, y(1 \u2212 x),\n2nd, Y not true, X true, x(1 \u2212 y),\nand the sum of these equated to unity gives\nx \u2212 2xy + y = 1, (32)\nof hypotheticals. 55\nwhich is the same as (31), and in fact the Propositions which they represent\nare equivalent.\nTo express the Proposition, Either X is not true, or Y is not true, the\nmembers not being exclusive.\nTo the cases contemplated in the last Example, we must add the fol-\nlowing, viz.\nX not true, Y not true, (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y).\nThe sum of the elective expressions gives\nx(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 1,\nor\nxy = 0. (33)\nTo express the disjunctive Proposition, Either X is true, or Y is true,\nor Z is true, the members being exclusive.\nHere the mutually exclusive cases are\n1st, X true, Y false, Z false, x(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z),\n2nd, Y true, Z false, X false, y(1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 x),\n3rd, Z true, X false, Y false, z(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y),\nand the sum of the elective expressions equated to 1, gives, upon reduction,\nx + y + z \u2212 2(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz = 1. (34)\nThe expression of the same Proposition, when the members are in no\nsense exclusive, will be\n(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)(1 \u2212 z) = 0. (35)\nof hypotheticals. 56\nAnd it is easy to see that our method will apply to the expression of any\nsimilar Proposition, whose members are subject to any specified amount\nand character of exclusion.\nTo express the conditional Proposition, If X is true, Y is true.\nHere it is implied that all the cases of X being true, are cases of Y being\ntrue. The former cases being determined by the elective symbol x, and the\nlatter by y, we have, in virtue of (4),\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0. (36)\nTo express the conditional Proposition, If X be true, Y is not true.\nThe equation is obviously\nxy = 0; (37)\nthis is equivalent to (33), and in fact the disjunctive Proposition, Either\nX is not true, or Y is not true, and the conditional Proposition, If X is\ntrue, Y is not true, are equivalent.\nTo express that If X is not true, Y is not true.\nIn (36) write 1 \u2212 x for x, and 1 \u2212 y for y, we have\n(1 \u2212 x)y = 0.\nThe results which we have obtained admit of verification in many dif-\nferent ways. Let it suffice to take for more particular examination the\nequation\nx \u2212 2xy + y = 1, (38)\nwhich expresses the conditional Proposition, Either X is true, or Y is true,\nthe members being in this case exclusive.\nFirst, let the Proposition X be true, then x = 1, and substituting, we\nhave\n1 \u2212 2y + y = 1, \u2234 \u2212y = 0, or y = 0,\nwhich implies that Y is not true.\nof hypotheticals. 57\nSecondly, let X be not true, then x = 0, and the equation gives\ny = 1, (39)\nwhich implies that Y is true. In like manner we may proceed with the\nassumptions that Y is true, or that Y is false.\nAgain, in virtue of the property x2 = x, y2 = y, we may write the\nequation in the form\nx2 \u2212 2xy + y2 = 1,\nand extracting the square root, we have\nx \u2212 y = \u00b11, (40)\nand this represents the actual case; for, as when X is true or false, Y is\nrespectively false or true, we have\nx = 1 or 0,\ny = 0 or 1,\n\u2234 x \u2212 y = 1 or \u2212 1.\nThere will be no difficulty in the analysis of other cases.\nExamples of Hypothetical Syllogism.\nThe treatment of every form of hypothetical Syllogism will consist in\nforming the equations of the premises, and eliminating the symbol or sym-\nbols which are found in more than one of them. The result will express the\nconclusion.\nof hypotheticals. 58\n1st. Disjunctive Syllogism.\nEither X is true, or Y is true (exclusive), x + y \u2212 2xy = 1,\nBut X is true, x = 1,\nTherefore Y is not true, \u2234 y = 0.\nEither X is true, or Y is true (not exclusive), x + y \u2212 xy = 1,\nBut X is not true, x = 0,\nTherefore Y is true, \u2234 y = 1.\n2nd. Constructive Conditional Syllogism.\nIf X is true, Y is true, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nBut X is true, x = 1,\nTherefore Y is true, \u2234 1 \u2212 y = 0 or y = 1.\n3rd. Destructive Conditional Syllogism.\nIf X is true, Y is true, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nBut Y is not true, y = 0,\nTherefore X is not true, \u2234 x = 0.\n4th. Simple Constructive Dilemma, the minor premiss exclusive.\nIf X is true, Y is true, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0, (41)\nIf Z is true, Y is true, z(1 \u2212 y) = 0, (42)\nBut Either X is true, or Z is true, x + z \u2212 2xz = 1. (43)\nFrom the equations (41), (42), (43), we have to eliminate x and z. In\nwhatever way we effect this, the result is\ny = 1;\nwhence it appears that the Proposition Y is true.\nof hypotheticals. 59\n5th. Complex Constructive Dilemma, the minor premiss not exclusive.\nIf X is true, Y is true, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nIf W is true, Z is true, w(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\nEither X is true, or W is true, x + w \u2212 xw = 1.\nFrom these equations, eliminating x, we have\ny + z \u2212 yz = 1,\nwhich expresses the Conclusion, Either Y is true, or Z is true, the members\nbeing nonexclusive.\n6th. Complex Destructive Dilemma, the minor premiss exclusive.\nIf X is true, Y is true, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nIf W is true, Z is true, w(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\nEither Y is not true, or Z is not true, y + z \u2212 2yz = 1.\nFrom these equations we must eliminate y and z. The result is\nxw = 0,\nwhich expresses the Conclusion, Either X is not true, or Y is not true, the\nmembers not being exclusive.\n7th. Complex Destructive Dilemma, the minor premiss not exclusive.\nIf X is true, Y is true, x(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nIf W is true, Z is true, w(1 \u2212 z) = 0,\nEither Y is not true, or Z is not true, yz = 0.\nOn elimination of y and z, we have\nxw = 0,\nwhich indicates the same Conclusion as the previous example.\nof hypotheticals. 60\nIt appears from these and similar cases, that whether the members of\nthe minor premiss of a Dilemma are exclusive or not, the members of the\n(disjunctive) Conclusion are never exclusive. This fact has perhaps escaped\nthe notice of logicians.\nThe above are the principal forms of hypothetical Syllogism which lo-\ngicians have recognised. It would be easy, however, to extend the list,\nespecially by the blending of the disjunctive and the conditional character\nin the same Proposition, of which the following is an example.\nIf X is true, then either Y is true, or Z is true,\nx(1 \u2212 y \u2212 z + yz) = 0,\nBut Y is not true, y = 0,\nTherefore If X is true, Z is true, \u2234 x(1 \u2212 z) = 0.\nThat which logicians term a Causal Proposition is properly a condi-\ntional Syllogism, the major premiss of which is suppressed.\nThe assertion that the Proposition X is true, because the Proposition Y\nis true, is equivalent to the assertion,\nThe Proposition Y is true,\nTherefore the Proposition X is true;\nand these are the minor premiss and conclusion of the conditional Syllo-\ngism,\nIf Y is true, X is true,\nBut Y is true,\nTherefore X is true.\nAnd thus causal Propositions are seen to be included in the applications\nof our general method.\nNote, that there is a family of disjunctive and conditional Propositions,\nwhich do not, of right, belong to the class considered in this Chapter.\nof hypotheticals. 61\nSuch are those in which the force of the disjunctive or conditional particle\nis expended upon the predicate of the Proposition, as if, speaking of the\ninhabitants of a particular island, we should say, that they are all either\nEuropeans or Asiatics; meaning, that it is true of each individual, that he\nis either a European or an Asiatic. If we appropriate the elective symbol x\nto the inhabitants, y to Europeans, and z to Asiatics, then the equation of\nthe above Proposition is\nx = xy + xz, or x(1 \u2212 y \u2212 z) = 0; (a)\nto which we might add the condition yz = 0, since no Europeans are\nAsiatics. The nature of the symbols x, y, z, indicates that the Proposition\nbelongs to those which we have before designated as Categorical. Very\ndifferent from the above is the Proposition, Either all the inhabitants are\nEuropeans, or they are all Asiatics. Here the disjunctive particle separates\nPropositions. The case is that contemplated in (31) of the present Chapter;\nand the symbols by which it is expressed, although subject to the same laws\nas those of (a), have a totally different interpretation.\u2217\nThe distinction is real and important. Every Proposition which lan-\nguage can express may be represented by elective symbols, and the laws of\ncombination of those symbols are in all cases the same; but in one class of\ninstances the symbols have reference to collections of objects, in the other,\nto the truths of constituent Propositions.\n\u2217Some writers, among whom is Dr. Latham (First Outlines), regard it as the exclu-\nsive office of a conjunction to connect Propositions, not words. In this view I am not\nable to agree. The Proposition, Every animal is either rational or irrational, cannot be\nresolved into, Either every animal is rational, or every animal is irrational. The former\nbelongs to pure categoricals, the latter to hypotheticals. In singular Propositions, such\nconversions would seem to be allowable. This animal is either rational or irrational,\nis equivalent to, Either this animal is rational, or it is irrational. This peculiarity of\nsingular Propositions would almost justify our ranking them, though truly universals,\nin a separate class, as Ramus and his followers did.\nPROPERTIES OF ELECTIVE FUNCTIONS.\nSince elective symbols combine according to the laws of quantity, we\nmay, by Maclaurin\u2019s theorem, expand a given function \u03c6(x), in ascending\npowers of x, known cases of failure excepted. Thus we have\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(0) + \u03c6\u2032(0)x + \u03c6\u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 x2 + &c. (44)\nNow x2 = x, x3 = x, &c., whence\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(0) + x{\u03c6\u2032(0) + \u03c6\u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 + &c.}. (45)\nNow if in (44) we make x = 1, we have\n\u03c6(1) = \u03c6(0) + \u03c6\u2032(0) + \u03c6\u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 + &c.,\nwhence\n\u03c6\u2032(0) + \u03c6\u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 + \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 3 + &c. = \u03c6(1) \u2212 \u03c6(0).\nSubstitute this value for the coefficient of x in the second member\nof (45), and we have\u2217\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(0) + {\u03c6(1) \u2212 \u03c6(0)}x, (46)\n\u2217Although this and the following theorems have only been proved for those forms of\nfunctions which are expansible by Maclaurin\u2019s theorem, they may be regarded as true\nfor all forms whatever; this will appear from the applications. The reason seems to be\nthat, as it is only through the one form of expansion that elective functions become\ninterpretable, no conflicting interpretation is possible.\nThe development of \u03c6(x) may also be determined thus. By the known formula for\nexpansion in factorials,\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(0) + \u2206\u03c6(0)x + \u22062\u03c6(0)\n1 \u00b7 2 x(x \u2212 1) + &c.\nproperties of elective functions. 63\nwhich we shall also employ under the form\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(1)x + \u03c6(0)(1 \u2212 x). (47)\nEvery function of x, in which integer powers of that symbol are alone\ninvolved, is by this theorem reducible to the first order. The quantities\n\u03c6(0), \u03c6(1), we shall call the moduli of the function \u03c6(x). They are of great\nimportance in the theory of elective functions, as will appear from the\nsucceeding Propositions.\nProp. 1. Any two functions \u03c6(x), \u03c8(x), are equivalent, whose corre-\nsponding moduli are equal.\nThis is a plain consequence of the last Proposition. For since\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(0) + {\u03c6(1) \u2212 \u03c6(0)}x,\n\u03c8(x) = \u03c8(0) + {\u03c8(1) \u2212 \u03c8(0)}x,\nit is evident that if \u03c6(0) = \u03c8(0), \u03c6(1) = \u03c8(1), the two expansions will\nbe equivalent, and therefore the functions which they represent will be\nequivalent also.\nNow x being an elective symbol, x(x \u2212 1) = 0, so that all the terms after the second,\nvanish. Also \u2206\u03c6(0) = \u03c6(1) \u2212 \u03c6(0), whence\n\u03c6{x = \u03c6(0)} + {\u03c6(1) \u2212 \u03c6(0)}x.\nThe mathematician may be interested in the remark, that this is not the only case\nin which an expansion stops at the second term. The expansions of the compound\noperative functions \u03c6\n( d\ndx + x\u22121\n)\nand \u03c6\n{\nx +\n( d\ndx\n)\u22121}\nare, respectively,\n\u03c6\n( d\ndx\n)\n+ \u03c6\u2032\n( d\ndx\n)\nx\u22121,\nand\n\u03c6(x) + \u03c6\u2032(x)\n( d\ndx\n)\u22121\n.\nSee Cambridge Mathematical Journal, Vol. iv. p. 219.\nproperties of elective functions. 64\nThe converse of this Proposition is equally true, viz.\nIf two functions are equivalent, their corresponding moduli are equal.\nAmong the most important applications of the above theorem, we may\nnotice the following.\nSuppose it required to determine for what forms of the function \u03c6(x),\nthe following equation is satisfied, viz.\n{\u03c6(x)}n = \u03c6(x).\nHere we at once obtain for the expression of the conditions in question,\n{\u03c6(0)}n = \u03c6(0), {\u03c6(1)}n = \u03c6(1). (48)\nAgain, suppose it required to determine the conditions under which the\nfollowing equation is satisfied, viz.\n\u03c6(x)\u03c8(x) = \u03c7(x).\nThe general theorem at once gives\n\u03c6(0)\u03c8(0) = \u03c7(0), \u03c6(1)\u03c8(1) = \u03c7(1). (49)\nThis result may also be proved by substituting for \u03c6(x), \u03c8(x), \u03c7(x),\ntheir expanded forms, and equating the coefficients of the resulting equa-\ntion properly reduced.\nAll the above theorems may be extended to functions of more than\none symbol. For, as different elective symbols combine with each other\naccording to the same laws as symbols of quantity, we can first expand a\ngiven function with reference to any particular symbol which it contains,\nand then expand the result with reference to any other symbol, and so on\nin succession, the order of the expansions being quite indifferent.\nThus the given function being \u03c6(xy) we have\n\u03c6(xy) = \u03c6(x0) + {\u03c6(x1) \u2212 \u03c6(x0)}y,\nproperties of elective functions. 65\nand expanding the coefficients with reference to x, and reducing\n\u03c6(xy) = \u03c6(00) + {\u03c6(10) \u2212 \u03c6(00)}x + {\u03c6(01) \u2212 \u03c6(00)}y\n+ {\u03c6(11) \u2212 \u03c6(10) \u2212 \u03c6(01) + \u03c6(00)}xy, (50)\nto which we may give the elegant symmetrical form\n\u03c6(xy) = \u03c6(00)(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) + \u03c6(01)y(1 \u2212 x)\n+ \u03c6(10)x(1 \u2212 y) + \u03c6(11)xy, (51)\nwherein we shall, in accordance with the language already employed, des-\nignate \u03c6(00), \u03c6(01), \u03c6(10), \u03c6(11), as the moduli of the function \u03c6(xy).\nBy inspection of the above general form, it will appear that any func-\ntions of two variables are equivalent, whose corresponding moduli are all\nequal.\nThus the conditions upon which depends the satisfaction of the equa-\ntion, {\u03c6(xy)}n = \u03c6(xy)\nare seen to be\n{\u03c6(00)}n = \u03c6(00), {\u03c6(01)}n = \u03c6(01),\n{\u03c6(10)}n = \u03c6(10), {\u03c6(11)}n = \u03c6(11). (52)\nAnd the conditions upon which depends the satisfaction of the equation\n\u03c6(xy)\u03c8(xy) = \u03c7(xy),\nare \u03c6(00)\u03c8(00) = \u03c7(00), \u03c6(01)\u03c8(01) = \u03c7(01),\n\u03c6(10)\u03c8(10) = \u03c7(10), \u03c6(11)\u03c8(11) = \u03c7(11). (53)\nIt is very easy to assign by induction from (47) and (51), the general\nform of an expanded elective function. It is evident that if the number\nof elective symbols is m, the number of the moduli will be 2m, and that\nproperties of elective functions. 66\ntheir separate values will be obtained by interchanging in every possible\nway the values 1 and 0 in the places of the elective symbols of the given\nfunction. The several terms of the expansion of which the moduli serve as\ncoefficients, will then be formed by writing for each 1 that recurs under\nthe functional sign, the elective symbol x, &c., which it represents, and for\neach 0 the corresponding 1 \u2212 x, &c., and regarding these as factors, the\nproduct of which, multiplied by the modulus from which they are obtained,\nconstitutes a term of the expansion.\nThus, if we represent the moduli of any elective function \u03c6(xy . . . ) by\na1, a2, . . . , ar, the function itself, when expanded and arranged with ref-\nerence to the moduli, will assume the form\n\u03c6(xy) = a1t1 + a2t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + artr, (54)\nin which t1t2 . . . tr are functions of x, y, . . . , resolved into factors of the\nforms x, y, . . . 1 \u2212 x, 1 \u2212 y, . . . &c. These functions satisfy individually\nthe index relations\ntn\n1 = t1, tn\n2 = t2, &c., (55)\nand the further relations,\nt1t2 = 0 . . . t1t2 = 0, &c., (56)\nthe product of any two of them vanishing. This will at once be inferred\nfrom inspection of the particular forms (47) and (51). Thus in the latter\nwe have for the values of t1, t2, &c., the forms\nxy, x(1 \u2212 y), (1 \u2212 x)y, (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y);\nand it is evident that these satisfy the index relation, and that their prod-\nucts all vanish. We shall designate t1t2 . . . as the constituent functions\nof \u03c6(xy), and we shall define the peculiarity of the vanishing of the binary\nproducts, by saying that those functions are exclusive. And indeed the\nclasses which they represent are mutually exclusive.\nproperties of elective functions. 67\nThe sum of all the constituents of an expanded function is unity. An\nelegant proof of this Proposition will be obtained by expanding 1 as a\nfunction of any proposed elective symbols. Thus if in (51) we assume\n\u03c6(xy) = 1, we have \u03c6(11) = 1, \u03c6(10) = 1, \u03c6(01) = 1, \u03c6(00) = 1, and\n(51) gives\n1 = xy + x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y + (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y). (57)\nIt is obvious indeed, that however numerous the symbols involved, all\nthe moduli of unity are unity, whence the sum of the constituents is unity.\nWe are now prepared to enter upon the question of the general inter-\npretation of elective equations. For this purpose we shall find the following\nPropositions of the greatest service.\nProp. 2. If the first member of the general equation \u03c6(xy . . . ) = 0, be\nexpanded in a series of terms, each of which is of the form at, a being a\nmodulus of the given function, then for every numerical modulus a which\ndoes not vanish, we shall have the equation\nat = 0,\nand the combined interpretations of these several equations will express\nthe full significance of the original equation.\nFor, representing the equation under the form\na1t1 + a2t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + artr = 0. (58)\nMultiplying by t1 we have, by (56),\na1t1 = 0, (59)\nwhence if a1 is a numerical constant which does not vanish,\nt1 = 0,\nand similarly for all the moduli which do not vanish. And inasmuch as\nfrom these constituent equations we can form the given equation, their\ninterpretations will together express its entire significance.\nproperties of elective functions. 68\nThus if the given equation were\nx \u2212 y = 0, Xs and Ys are identical, (60)\nwe should have \u03c6(11) = 0, \u03c6(10) = 1, \u03c6(01) = \u22121, \u03c6(00) = 0, so that the\nexpansion (51) would assume the form\nx(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x) = 0,\nwhence, by the above theorem,\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0, All Xs are Ys,\ny(1 \u2212 x) = 0, All Ys are Xs,\nresults which are together equivalent to (60).\nIt may happen that the simultaneous satisfaction of equations thus\ndeduced, may require that one or more of the elective symbols should\nvanish. This would only imply the nonexistence of a class: it may even\nhappen that it may lead to a final result of the form\n1 = 0,\nwhich would indicate the nonexistence of the logical Universe. Such cases\nwill only arise when we attempt to unite contradictory Propositions in a\nsingle equation. The manner in which the difficulty seems to be evaded in\nthe result is characteristic.\nIt appears from this Proposition, that the differences in the interpreta-\ntion of elective functions depend solely upon the number and position of\nthe vanishing moduli. No change in the value of a modulus, but one which\ncauses it to vanish, produces any change in the interpretation of the equa-\ntion in which it is found. If among the infinite number of different values\nwhich we are thus permitted to give to the moduli which do not vanish in a\nproposed equation, any one value should be preferred, it is unity, for when\nthe moduli of a function are all either 0 or 1, the function itself satisfies\nthe condition {\u03c6(xy . . . )}n = \u03c6(xy . . . ),\nproperties of elective functions. 69\nand this at once introduces symmetry into our Calculus, and provides us\nwith fixed standards for reference.\nProp. 3. If w = \u03c6(xy . . . ), w, x, y, . . . being elective symbols, and\nif the second member be completely expanded and arranged in a series of\nterms of the form at, we shall be permitted to equate separately to 0 every\nterm in which the modulus a does not satisfy the condition\nan = a,\nand to leave for the value of w the sum of the remaining terms.\nAs the nature of the demonstration of this Proposition is quite un-\naffected by the number of the terms in the second member, we will for\nsimplicity confine ourselves to the supposition of there being four, and\nsuppose that the moduli of the two first only, satisfy the index law.\nWe have then\nw = a1t1 + a2t2 + a3t3 + a4t4, (61)\nwith the relations\nan\n1 = a1, an\n2 = a2,\nin addition to the two sets of relations connecting t1, t2, t3, t4, in accordance\nwith (55) and (56).\nSquaring (61), we have\nw = a1t1 + a2t2 + a2\n3t3 + a2\n4t4,\nand subtracting (61) from this,\n(a2\n3 \u2212 a3)t3 + (a2\n4 \u2212 a4)t4 = 0;\nand it being an hypothesis, that the coefficients of these terms do not\nvanish, we have, by Prop. 2,\nt3 = 0, t4 = 0, (62)\nwhence (61) becomes\nw = a1t1 + a2t2.\nproperties of elective functions. 70\nThe utility of this Proposition will hereafter appear.\nProp. 4. The functions t1t2 . . . tr being mutually exclusive, we shall\nalways have\n\u03c8(a1t1 + a2t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + artr) = \u03c8(a1)t1 + \u03c8(a2)t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c8(ar)tr, (63)\nwhatever may be the values of a1a2 . . . ar or the form of \u03c8.\nLet the function a1t1 + a2t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + artr be represented by \u03c6(xy . . . ), then\nthe moduli a1a2 . . . ar will be given by the expressions\n\u03c6(11 . . . ), \u03c6(10 . . . ), (. . . ) \u03c6(00 . . . ).\nAlso\n\u03c8(a1t1 + a2t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + artr) = \u03c8{\u03c6(xy . . . )}\n= \u03c8{\u03c6(11 . . . )}xy \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c8{\u03c6(10 . . . )}x(1 \u2212 y) . . .\n+ \u03c8{\u03c6(00 . . . )}(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) . . .\n= \u03c8(a1)xy \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c8(a2)x(1 \u2212 y) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c8(ar)(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) . . .\n= \u03c8(a1)t1 + \u03c8(a2)t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c8(ar)tr. (64)\nIt would not be difficult to extend the list of interesting properties,\nof which the above are examples. But those which we have noticed are\nsufficient for our present requirements. The following Proposition may\nserve as an illustration of their utility.\nProp. 5. Whatever process of reasoning we apply to a single given\nProposition, the result will either be the same Proposition or a limitation\nof it.\nLet us represent the equation of the given Proposition under its most\ngeneral form,\na1t1 + a2t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + artr = 0, (65)\nresolvable into as many equations of the form t = 0 as there are moduli\nwhich do not vanish.\nproperties of elective functions. 71\nNow the most general transformation of this equation is\n\u03c8(a1t1 + a2t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + artr) = \u03c8(0), (66)\nprovided that we attribute to \u03c8 a perfectly arbitrary character, allowing it\neven to involve new elective symbols, having any proposed relation to the\noriginal ones.\nThe development of (66) gives, by the last Proposition,\n\u03c8(a1)t1 + \u03c8(a2)t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + \u03c8(ar)tr = \u03c8(0).\nTo reduce this to the general form of reference, it is only necessary to\nobserve that since\nt1 + t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + tr = 1,\nwe may write for \u03c8(0),\n\u03c8(0)(t1 + t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + tr),\nwhence, on substitution and transposition,\n{\u03c8(a1) \u2212 \u03c8(0)}t1 + {\u03c8(a2) \u2212 \u03c8(0)}t2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + {\u03c8(ar) \u2212 \u03c8(0)}tr = 0.\nFrom which it appears, that if a be any modulus of the original equation,\nthe corresponding modulus of the transformed equation will be\n\u03c8(a) \u2212 \u03c8(0).\nIf a = 0, then \u03c8(a) \u2212 \u03c8(0) = \u03c8(0) \u2212 \u03c8(0) = 0, whence there are no\nnew terms in the transformed equation, and therefore there are no new\nPropositions given by equating its constituent members to 0.\nAgain, since \u03c8(a)\u2212\u03c8(0) may vanish without a vanishing, terms may be\nwanting in the transformed equation which existed in the primitive. Thus\nsome of the constituent truths of the original Proposition may entirely\ndisappear from the interpretation of the final result.\nproperties of elective functions. 72\nLastly, if \u03c8(a) \u2212 \u03c8(0) do not vanish, it must either be a numerical\nconstant, or it must involve new elective symbols. In the former case, the\nterm in which it is found will give\nt = 0,\nwhich is one of the constituents of the original equation: in the latter case\nwe shall have {\u03c8(a) \u2212 \u03c8(0)}t = 0,\nin which t has a limiting factor. The interpretation of this equation, there-\nfore, is a limitation of the interpretation of (65).\nThe purport of the last investigation will be more apparent to the math-\nematician than to the logician. As from any mathematical equation an\ninfinite number of others may be deduced, it seemed to be necessary to\nshew that when the original equation expresses a logical Proposition, ev-\nery member of the derived series, even when obtained by expansion under\na functional sign, admits of exact and consistent interpretation.\nOF THE SOLUTION OF ELECTIVE EQUATIONS.\nIn whatever way an elective symbol, considered as unknown, may be\ninvolved in a proposed equation, it is possible to assign its complete value\nin terms of the remaining elective symbols considered as known. It is\nto be observed of such equations, that from the very nature of elective\nsymbols, they are necessarily linear, and that their solutions have a very\nclose analogy with those of linear differential equations, arbitrary elective\nsymbols in the one, occupying the place of arbitrary constants in the other.\nThe method of solution we shall in the first place illustrate by particular\nexamples, and, afterwards, apply to the investigation of general theorems.\nGiven (1 \u2212 x)y = 0, (All Ys are Xs), to determine y in terms of x.\nAs y is a function of x, we may assume y = vx + v\u2032(1 \u2212 x), (such being\nthe expression of an arbitrary function of x), the moduli v and v\u2032 remaining\nto be determined. We have then\n(1 \u2212 x){vx + v\u2032(1 \u2212 x)} = 0,\nor, on actual multiplication,\nv\u2032(1 \u2212 x) = 0;\nthat this may be generally true, without imposing any restriction upon x,\nwe must assume v\u2032 = 0, and there being no condition to limit v, we have\ny = vx. (67)\nThis is the complete solution of the equation. The condition that y is\nan elective symbol requires that v should be an elective symbol also (since\nit must satisfy the index law), its interpretation in other respects being\narbitrary.\nSimilarly the solution of the equation, xy = 0, is\ny = v(1 \u2212 x). (68)\nof the solution of elective equations. 74\nGiven (1 \u2212 x)zy = 0, (All Ys which are Zs are Xs), to determine y.\nAs y is a function of x and z, we may assume\ny = v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z) + v\u2032(1 \u2212 x)z + v\u2032\u2032x(1 \u2212 z) + v\u2032\u2032\u2032zx.\nAnd substituting, we get\nv\u2032(1 \u2212 x)z = 0,\nwhence v\u2032 = 0. The complete solution is therefore\ny = v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z) + v\u2032\u2032x(1 \u2212 z) + v\u2032\u2032\u2032xz, (69)\nv\u2032, v\u2032\u2032, v\u2032\u2032\u2032, being arbitrary elective symbols, and the rigorous interpretation\nof this result is, that Every Y is either a not-X and not-Z, or an X and\nnot-Z, or an X and Z.\nIt is deserving of note that the above equation may, in consequence\nof its linear form, be solved by adding the two particular solutions with\nreference to x and z; and replacing the arbitrary constants which each\ninvolves by an arbitrary function of the other symbol, the result is\ny = x\u03c6(z) + (1 \u2212 z)\u03c8(x). (70)\nTo shew that this solution is equivalent to the other, it is only necessary\nto substitute for the arbitrary functions \u03c6(z), \u03c8(x), their equivalents\nwz + w\u2032(1 \u2212 z) and w\u2032\u2032x + w\u2032\u2032\u2032(1 \u2212 x),\nwe get\ny = wxz + (w + w\u2032\u2032)x(1 \u2212 z) + w\u2032\u2032\u2032(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z).\nIn consequence of the perfectly arbitrary character of w\u2032 and w\u2032\u2032, we\nmay replace their sum by a single symbol w, whence\ny = wxz + w\u2032x(1 \u2212 z) + w\u2032\u2032\u2032(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 z),\nwhich agrees with (69).\nof the solution of elective equations. 75\nThe solution of the equation wx(1 \u2212 y)z = 0, expressed by arbitrary\nfunctions, is\nz = (1 \u2212 w)\u03c6(xy) + (1 \u2212 x)\u03c8(wy) + y\u03c7(wx). (71)\nThese instances may serve to shew the analogy which exists between\nthe solutions of elective equations and those of the corresponding order\nof linear differential equations. Thus the expression of the integral of a\npartial differential equation, either by arbitrary functions or by a series\nwith arbitrary coefficients, is in strict analogy with the case presented in\nthe two last examples. To pursue this comparison further would minister to\ncuriosity rather than to utility. We shall prefer to contemplate the problem\nof the solution of elective equations under its most general aspect, which\nis the object of the succeeding investigations.\nTo solve the general equation \u03c6(xy) = 0, with reference to y.\nIf we expand the given equation with reference to x and y, we have\n\u03c6(00)(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) + \u03c6(01)(1 \u2212 x)y + \u03c6(10)x(1 \u2212 y) + \u03c6(11)xy = 0, (72)\nthe coefficients \u03c6(00) &c. being numerical constants.\nNow the general expression of y, as a function of x, is\ny = vx + v\u2032(1 \u2212 x),\nv and v\u2032 being unknown symbols to be determined. Substituting this value\nin (72), we obtain a result which may be written in the following form,\n[\u03c6(10) + {\u03c6(11) \u2212 \u03c6(10)}v]x + [\u03c6(00) + {\u03c6(00) \u2212 \u03c6(00)}v\u2032](1 \u2212 x) = 0;\nand in order that this equation may be satisfied without any way restricting\nthe generality of x, we must have\n\u03c6(10) + {\u03c6(11) \u2212 \u03c6(10)}v = 0,\n\u03c6(00) + {\u03c6(01) \u2212 \u03c6(00)}v\u2032 = 0,\nof the solution of elective equations. 76\nfrom which we deduce\nv = \u03c6(10)\n\u03c6(10) \u2212 \u03c6(11) , v\u2032 = \u03c6(00)\n\u03c6(01) \u2212 \u03c6(00) ,\nwherefore\ny = \u03c6(10)\n\u03c6(10) \u2212 \u03c6(11) x + \u03c6(00)\n\u03c6(00) \u2212 \u03c6(01) (1 \u2212 x). (73)\nHad we expanded the original equation with respect to y only, we should\nhave had\n\u03c6(x0) + {\u03c6(x1) \u2212 \u03c6(x0)}y = 0;\nbut it might have startled those who are unaccustomed to the processes of\nSymbolical Algebra, had we from this equation deduced\ny = \u03c6(x0)\n\u03c6(x0) \u2212 \u03c6(x1) ,\nbecause of the apparently meaningless character of the second member.\nSuch a result would however have been perfectly lawful, and the expansion\nof the second member would have given us the solution above obtained. I\nshall in the following example employ this method, and shall only remark\nthat those to whom it may appear doubtful, may verify its conclusions by\nthe previous method.\nTo solve the general equation \u03c6(xyz) = 0, or in other words to deter-\nmine the value of z as a function of x and y.\nExpanding the given equation with reference to z, we have\n\u03c6(xy0) + {\u03c6(xy1) \u2212 \u03c6(xy0)}z = 0;\n\u2234 z = \u03c6(xy0)\n\u03c6(xy0) \u2212 \u03c6(xy1) , (74)\nand expanding the second member as a function of x and y by aid of the\nof the solution of elective equations. 77\ngeneral theorem, we have\nz = \u03c6(110)\n\u03c6(110) \u2212 \u03c6(111) xy + \u03c6(100)\n\u03c6(100) \u2212 \u03c6(101) x(1 \u2212 y)\n+ \u03c6(010)\n\u03c6(010) \u2212 \u03c6(011) (1 \u2212 x)y + \u03c6(000)\n\u03c6(000) \u2212 \u03c6(001) (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y), (75)\nand this is the complete solution required. By the same method we may\nresolve an equation involving any proposed number of elective symbols.\nIn the interpretation of any general solution of this nature, the following\ncases may present themselves.\nThe values of the moduli \u03c6(00), \u03c6(01), &c. being constant, one or more\nof the coefficients of the solution may assume the form 0\n0 or 1\n0 . In the former\ncase, the indefinite symbol 0\n0 must be replaced by an arbitrary elective\nsymbol v. In the latter case, the term, which is multiplied by a factor 1\n0\n(or by any numerical constant except 1), must be separately equated to 0,\nand will indicate the existence of a subsidiary Proposition. This is evident\nfrom (62).\nEx. Given x(1 \u2212 y) = 0, All Xs are Ys, to determine y as a function\nof x.\nLet \u03c6(xy) = x(1 \u2212 y), then \u03c6(10) = 1, \u03c6(11) = 0, \u03c6(01) = 0, \u03c6(00) = 0;\nwhence, by (73),\ny = 1\n1 \u2212 0 x + 0\n0 \u2212 0 (1 \u2212 x)\n= x + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)\n= x + v(1 \u2212 x), (76)\nv being an arbitrary elective symbol. The interpretation of this result is\nthat the class Y consists of the entire class X with an indefinite remainder\nof not-Xs. This remainder is indefinite in the highest sense, i. e. it may\nvary from 0 up to the entire class of not-Xs.\nEx. Given x(1 \u2212 z) + z = y, (the class Y consists of the entire class Z,\nwith such not-Zs as are Xs), to find Z.\nof the solution of elective equations. 78\nHere \u03c6(xyz) = x(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 y + z, whence we have the following set of\nvalues for the moduli,\n\u03c6(110) = 0, \u03c6(111) = 0, \u03c6(100) = 1, \u03c6(101) = 1,\n\u03c6(010) = \u22121, \u03c6(011) = 0, \u03c6(000) = 0, \u03c6(001) = 1,\nand substituting these in the general formula (75), we have\nz = 0\n0 xy + 1\n0 x(1 \u2212 y) + (1 \u2212 x)y, (77)\nthe infinite coefficient of the second term indicates the equation\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0, All Xs are Ys;\nand the indeterminate coefficient of the first term being replaced by v, an\narbitrary elective symbol, we have\nz = (1 \u2212 x)y + vxy,\nthe interpretation of which is, that the class Z consists of all the Ys which\nare not Xs, and an indefinite remainder of Ys which are Xs. Of course this\nindefinite remainder may vanish. The two results we have obtained are\nlogical inferences (not very obvious ones) from the original Propositions,\nand they give us all the information which it contains respecting the class Z,\nand its constituent elements.\nEx. Given x = y(1 \u2212 z) + z(1 \u2212 y). The class X consists of all Ys which\nare not-Zs, and all Zs which are not-Ys: required the class Z.\nWe have\n\u03c6(xyz) = x \u2212 y(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 z(1 \u2212 y),\n\u03c6(110) = 0, \u03c6(111) = 1, \u03c6(100) = 1, \u03c6(101) = 0,\n\u03c6(010) = \u22121, \u03c6(011) = 0, \u03c6(000) = 0, \u03c6(001) = \u22121;\nwhence, by substituting in (75),\nz = x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x), (78)\nof the solution of elective equations. 79\nthe interpretation of which is, the class Z consists of all Xs which are\nnot Ys, and of all Ys which are not Xs; an inference strictly logical.\nEx. Given y{1 \u2212 z(1 \u2212 x)} = 0, All Ys are Zs and not-Xs.\nProceeding as before to form the moduli, we have, on substitution in\nthe general formul\u00e6,\nz = 1\n0 xy + 0\n0 x(1 \u2212 y) + y(1 \u2212 x) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y),\nor\nz = y(1 \u2212 x) + vx(1 \u2212 y) + v\u2032(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)\n= y(1 \u2212 x) + (1 \u2212 y)\u03c6(x), (79)\nwith the relation\nxy = 0;\nfrom these it appears that No Ys are Xs, and that the class Z consists of\nall Ys which are not Xs, and of an indefinite remainder of not-Ys.\nThis method, in combination with Lagrange\u2019s method of indeterminate\nmultipliers, may be very elegantly applied to the treatment of simultaneous\nequations. Our limits only permit us to offer a single example, but the\nsubject is well deserving of further investigation.\nGiven the equations x(1 \u2212 z) = 0, z(1 \u2212 y) = 0, All Xs are Zs, All Zs\nare Ys, to determine the complete value of z with any subsidiary relations\nconnecting x and y.\nAdding the second equation multiplied by an indeterminate constant \u03bb,\nto the first, we have\nx(1 \u2212 z) + \u03bbz(1 \u2212 y) = 0,\nwhence determining the moduli, and substituting in (75),\nz = xy + 1\n1 \u2212 \u03bb x(1 \u2212 y) + 0\n0 (1 \u2212 x)y, (80)\nfrom which we derive\nz = xy + v(1 \u2212 x)y,\nof the solution of elective equations. 80\nwith the subsidiary relation\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0;\nthe former of these expresses that the class Z consists of all Xs that are Ys,\nwith an indefinite remainder of not-Xs that are Ys; the latter, that All Xs\nare Ys, being in fact the conclusion of the syllogism of which the two given\nPropositions are the premises.\nBy assigning an appropriate meaning to our symbols, all the equations\nwe have discussed would admit of interpretation in hypothetical, but it\nmay suffice to have considered them as examples of categoricals.\nThat peculiarity of elective symbols, in virtue of which every elective\nequation is reducible to a system of equations t1 = 0, t2 = 0, &c., so con-\nstituted, that all the binary products t1t2, t1t3, &c., vanish, represents a\ngeneral doctrine in Logic with reference to the ultimate analysis of Propo-\nsitions, of which it may be desirable to offer some illustration.\nAny of these constituents t1, t2, &c. consists only of factors of the forms\nx, y, . . . 1\u2212w, 1\u2212z, &c. In categoricals it therefore represents a compound\nclass, i. e. a class defined by the presence of certain qualities, and by the\nabsence of certain other qualities.\nEach constituent equation t1 = 0, &c. expresses a denial of the existence\nof some class so defined, and the different classes are mutually exclusive.\nThus all categorical Propositions are resolvable into a denial of the ex-\nistence of certain compound classes, no member of one such class being a\nmember of another.\nThe Proposition, All Xs are Ys, expressed by the equation x(1\u2212y) = 0,\nis resolved into a denial of the existence of a class whose members are Xs\nand not-Ys.\nThe Proposition Some Xs are Ys, expressed by v = xy, is resolvable as\nfollows. On expansion,\nv \u2212 xy = vx(1 \u2212 y) + vy(1 \u2212 x) + v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) \u2212 xy(1 \u2212 v);\n\u2234 vx(1 \u2212 y) = 0, vy(1 \u2212 x) = 0, v(1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y) = 0, (1 \u2212 v)xy = 0.\nof the solution of elective equations. 81\nThe three first imply that there is no class whose members belong to a\ncertain unknown Some, and are 1st, Xs and not Ys; 2nd, Ys and not Xs;\n3rd, not-Xs and not-Ys. The fourth implies that there is no class whose\nmembers are Xs and Ys without belonging to this unknown Some.\nFrom the same analysis it appears that all hypothetical Propositions\nmay be resolved into denials of the coexistence of the truth or falsity of\ncertain assertions.\nThus the Proposition, If X is true, Y is true, is resolvable by its equation\nx(1 \u2212 y) = 0, into a denial that the truth of X and the falsity of Y coexist.\nAnd the Proposition Either X is true, or Y is true, members exclusive,\nis resolvable into a denial, first, that X and Y are both true; secondly, that\nX and Y are both false.\nBut it may be asked, is not something more than a system of negations\nnecessary to the constitution of an affirmative Proposition? is not a posi-\ntive element required? Undoubtedly there is need of one; and this positive\nelement is supplied in categoricals by the assumption (which may be re-\ngarded as a prerequisite of reasoning in such cases) that there is a Universe\nof conceptions, and that each individual it contains either belongs to a pro-\nposed class or does not belong to it; in hypotheticals, by the assumption\n(equally prerequisite) that there is a Universe of conceivable cases, and\nthat any given Proposition is either true or false. Indeed the question of\nthe existence of conceptions (e\u00ca \u00easti) is preliminary to any statement of\ntheir qualities or relations (t\u00d0 \u00easti).\u2014Aristotle, Anal. Post. lib. ii. cap. 2.\nIt would appear from the above, that Propositions may be regarded as\nresting at once upon a positive and upon a negative foundation. Nor is such\na view either foreign to the spirit of Deductive Reasoning or inappropriate\nto its Method; the latter ever proceeding by limitations, while the former\ncontemplates the particular as derived from the general.\nof the solution of elective equations. 82\nDemonstration of the Method of Indeterminate Multipliers, as applied to\nSimultaneous Elective Equations.\nTo avoid needless complexity, it will be sufficient to consider the case of\nthree equations involving three elective symbols, those equations being the\nmost general of the kind. It will be seen that the case is marked by every\nfeature affecting the character of the demonstration, which would present\nitself in the discussion of the more general problem in which the number\nof equations and the number of variables are both unlimited.\nLet the given equations be\n\u03c6(xyz) = 0, \u03c8(xyz) = 0, \u03c7(xyz) = 0. (1)\nMultiplying the second and third of these by the arbitrary constants\nh and k, and adding to the first, we have\n\u03c6(xyz) + h\u03c8(xyz) + k\u03c7(xyz) = 0; (2)\nand we are to shew, that in solving this equation with reference to any\nvariable z by the general theorem (75), we shall obtain not only the general\nvalue of z independent of h and k, but also any subsidiary relations which\nmay exist between x and y independently of z.\nIf we represent the general equation (2) under the form F (xyz) = 0, its\nsolution may by (75) be written in the form\nz = xy\n1 \u2212 F (111)\nF (110)\n+ x(1 \u2212 y)\n1 \u2212 F (101)\nF (100)\n+ y(1 \u2212 x)\n1 \u2212 F (011)\nF (010)\n+ (1 \u2212 x)(1 \u2212 y)\n1 \u2212 F (001)\nF (000)\n;\nand we have seen, that any one of these four terms is to be equated to 0,\nwhose modulus, which we may represent by M , does not satisfy the con-\ndition M n = M , or, which is here the same thing, whose modulus has any\nother value than 0 or 1.\nof the solution of elective equations. 83\nConsider the modulus (suppose M1) of the first term, viz. 1\n1 \u2212 F (111)\nF (110)\n,\nand giving to the symbol F its full meaning, we have\nM1 = 1\n1 \u2212 \u03c6(111) + h\u03c8(111) + k\u03c7(111)\n\u03c6(110) + h\u03c8(110) + k\u03c7(110)\n.\nIt is evident that the condition M n\n1 = M1 cannot be satisfied unless\nthe right-hand member be independent of h and k; and in order that this\nmay be the case, we must have the function \u03c6(111) + h\u03c8(111) + k\u03c7(111)\n\u03c6(110) + h\u03c8(110) + k\u03c7(110)\nindependent of h and k.\nAssume then\n\u03c6(111) + h\u03c8(111) + k\u03c7(111)\n\u03c6(110) + h\u03c8(110) + k\u03c7(110) = c,\nc being independent of h and k; we have, on clearing of fractions and\nequating coefficients,\n\u03c6(111) = c\u03c6(110), \u03c8(111) = c\u03c8(110), \u03c7(111) = c\u03c7(110);\nwhence, eliminating c,\n\u03c6(111)\n\u03c6(110) = \u03c8(111)\n\u03c8(110) = \u03c7(111)\n\u03c7(110),\nbeing equivalent to the triple system\n\u03c6(111)\u03c8(110) \u2212 \u03c6(110)\u03c8(111) = 0,\n\u03c8(111)\u03c7(110) \u2212 \u03c8(110)\u03c7(111) = 0,\n\u03c7(111)\u03c6(110) \u2212 \u03c7(110)\u03c6(111) = 0;\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8fe (3)\nof the solution of elective equations. 84\nand it appears that if any one of these equations is not satisfied, the mod-\nulus M1 will not satisfy the condition M n\n1 = M1, whence the first term of\nthe value of z must be equated to 0, and we shall have\nxy = 0,\na relation between x and y independent of z.\nNow if we expand in terms of z each pair of the primitive equations (1),\nwe shall have\n\u03c6(xy0) + {\u03c6(xy1) \u2212 \u03c6(xy0)}z = 0,\n\u03c8(xy0) + {\u03c8(xy1) \u2212 \u03c8(xy0)}z = 0,\n\u03c7(xy0) + {\u03c7(xy1) \u2212 \u03c7(xy0)}z = 0,\nand successively eliminating z between each pair of these equations, we\nhave\n\u03c6(xy1)\u03c8(xy0) \u2212 \u03c6(xy0)\u03c8(xy1) = 0,\n\u03c8(xy1)\u03c7(xy0) \u2212 \u03c8(xy0)\u03c7(xy1) = 0,\n\u03c7(xy1)\u03c6(xy0) \u2212 \u03c7(xy0)\u03c6(xy1) = 0,\nwhich express all the relations between x and y that are formed by the\nelimination of z. Expanding these, and writing in full the first term, we\nhave\n{\u03c6(111)\u03c8(110) \u2212 \u03c6(110)\u03c8(111)}xy + &c. = 0,\n{\u03c8(111)\u03c7(110) \u2212 \u03c8(110)\u03c7(111)}xy + &c. = 0,\n{\u03c7(111)\u03c6(110) \u2212 \u03c7(110)\u03c6(111)}xy + &c. = 0;\nand it appears from Prop. 2. that if the coefficient of xy in any of these\nequations does not vanish, we shall have the equation\nxy = 0;\nof the solution of elective equations. 85\nbut the coefficients in question are the same as the first members of the\nsystem (3), and the two sets of conditions exactly agree. Thus, as respects\nthe first term of the expansion, the method of indeterminate coefficients\nleads to the same result as ordinary elimination; and it is obvious that\nfrom their similarity of form, the same reasoning will apply to all the other\nterms.\nSuppose, in the second place, that the conditions (3) are satisfied so\nthat M1 is independent of h and k. It will then indifferently assume the\nequivalent forms\nM1 = 1\n1 \u2212 \u03c6(111)\n\u03c6(110)\n= 1\n1 \u2212 \u03c8(111)\n\u03c8(110)\n= 1\n1 \u2212 \u03c7(111)\n\u03c7(110)\n.\nThese are the exact forms of the first modulus in the expanded values\nof z, deduced from the solution of the three primitive equations singly. If\nthis common value of M1 is 1 or 0\n0 = v, the term will be retained in z;\nif any other constant value (except 0), we have a relation xy = 0, not\ngiven by elimination, but deducible from the primitive equations singly,\nand similarly for all the other terms. Thus in every case the expression\nof the subsidiary relations is a necessary accompaniment of the process of\nsolution.\nIt is evident, upon consideration, that a similar proof will apply to the\ndiscussion of a system indefinite as to the number both of its symbols and\nof its equations.\nPOSTSCRIPT.\nSome additional explanations and references which have occurred to\nme during the printing of this work are subjoined.\nThe remarks on the connexion between Logic and Language, p. 4, are\nscarcely sufficiently explicit. Both the one and the other I hold to depend\nvery materially upon our ability to form general notions by the faculty of\nabstraction. Language is an instrument of Logic, but not an indispensable\ninstrument.\nTo the remarks on Cause, p. 11, I desire to add the following: Con-\nsidering Cause as an invariable antecedent in Nature, (which is Brown\u2019s\nview), whether associated or not with the idea of Power, as suggested by\nSir John Herschel, the knowledge of its existence is a knowledge which is\nproperly expressed by the word that (t\u00e4 \u00e5t\u00c8), not by why (t\u00e4 di\u00e5t\u00c8). It\nis very remarkable that the two greatest authorities in Logic, modern and\nancient, agreeing in the latter interpretation, differ most widely in its ap-\nplication to Mathematics. Sir W. Hamilton says that Mathematics exhibit\nonly the that (t\u00e4 \u00e5t\u00c8): Aristotle says, The why belongs to mathematicians,\nfor they have the demonstrations of Causes. Anal. Post. lib. i., cap. xiv.\nIt must be added that Aristotle\u2019s view is consistent with the sense (albeit\nan erroneous one) which in various parts of his writings he virtually assigns\nto the word Cause, viz. an antecedent in Logic, a sense according to which\nthe premises might be said to be the cause of the conclusion. This view\nappears to me to give even to his physical inquiries much of their peculiar\ncharacter.\nUpon reconsideration, I think that the view on p. 42, as to the presence\nor absence of a medium of comparison, would readily follow from Professor\nDe Morgan\u2019s doctrine, and I therefore relinquish all claim to a discovery.\nThe mode in which it appears in this treatise is, however, remarkable.\nI have seen reason to change the opinion expressed in pp. 43, 46. The\nsystem of equations there given for the expression of Propositions in Syllo-\npostscript. 87\ngism is always preferable to the one before employed\u2014first, in generality\u2014\nsecondly, in facility of interpretation.\nIn virtue of the principle, that a Proposition is either true or false, every\nelective symbol employed in the expression of hypotheticals admits only of\nthe values 0 and 1, which are the only quantitative forms of an elective\nsymbol. It is in fact possible, setting out from the theory of Probabili-\nties (which is purely quantitative), to arrive at a system of methods and\nprocesses for the treatment of hypotheticals exactly similar to those which\nhave been given. The two systems of elective symbols and of quantity os-\nculate, if I may use the expression, in the points 0 and 1. It seems to me\nto be implied by this, that unconditional truth (categoricals) and probable\ntruth meet together in the constitution of contingent truth (hypotheticals).\nThe general doctrine of elective symbols and all the more characteristic ap-\nplications are quite independent of any quantitative origin.\nTHE END.\n",

To-day popular usage is restoring to the term its original broad interpretation, and it is in this popular but rather unorthodox sense that \u201cMechanics\u201d has been chosen as the title of this book; for although certain elementary principles of mechanics are described and explained, the major portion of the book deals with machines and their evolution to their present stage of perfection.\n\nMachines are man\u2019s creation, and yet in a sense the man of to-day is a machine product; for modern civilization owes its material and in large measure its esthetic development to machinery. The story of machinery, from primitive man\u2019s first attempts to augment his physical powers with mechanical aids down to the present era of gigantic, steel-muscled machinery and marvelously intricate mechanisms, is the story of human progress. It is this story that we have endeavored to tell in the following pages, but the subject is too large to be covered in a single volume or even a dozen volumes. Under the circumstances we have been obliged to confine ourselves to a mere outline, selecting certain avenues of progress more marked than others and presenting brief sketch maps of them. We have aimed[4] in this way to give a bird\u2019s-eye view of the whole story of human progress in things material.\n\nThe book has not been written for the mechanical engineer, but for the layman who would learn of the mechanical contrivances that contribute to his material welfare; hence technical terms have been avoided, as far as possible, and where unavoidable have been explained and defined.\n\nA.

But a gorilla will throw stones at his enemy; and he knows how to brandish a club and use it with telling force. Some of the apes are known to use sticks to knock down fruit which is out of the reach of their hands, and they will crack nuts with a stone. Clearly these animals are tool users. A very intelligent orang-utan in the Bronx Zo\u00f6logical Garden, New York, after trying for days to wrench off a bracket from the wall of his cage eventually used the horizontal bar of his trapeze as a lever and with it pried the offending bracket from its fastenings. Here was real invention and the discovery of the principle of leverage. The great black arara cockatoo of New Guinea uses his beak as a saw to weaken the shells of hard nuts, and to keep his bill from slipping off the smooth[10] shell he is ingenious enough to wrap a leaf around the nut to hold it steady.\n\nEven in the insect world we find creatures resourceful enough to make use of tools. Prof. Franz Doflein of the University of Breslau tells of an interesting study of certain ants, known as the Oecophylla smaragdina, who build their nests in bushes by fastening leaves together with fine threads. But the ants that build the nests cannot spin these threads, because they possess no spinning glands. They must depend upon their larv\u00e6 for this product. When a rent was made in one of these nests, a band of the tiny creatures ranged themselves side by side along the torn edge of the leaf and reached across the gap until they could catch hold of the opposite edge with their mandibles. Then they drew back step by step, with perfect teamwork, until the two edges were brought together. In the meantime, other ants had rushed to the nursery and each one had picked up a larva, not with the idea of bearing it off to safety, but in order that the babies might spin the thread which the adult ants were unable to do. The larv\u00e6 were carried to the breach in the nest and moved back and forth across the rent. They were pressed first against one side of the tear and then the other and all the while were squeezed tightly, evidently with the purpose of making them spin. Gradually a fine silky web was woven across the torn leaf and eventually the rent was completely patched.\n\nUnquestionably these little ants are tool-using animals, because they make their larv\u00e6 serve as spinning spindles and also as weavers\u2019 shuttles. However, this can hardly be cited as a point in common with even the lowest type of man, for the ants merely use the tools they find at their disposal.[11] They certainly cannot be credited with having produced or even improved the tool which they use, whereas even in the most primitive of men we find that the tools used are not only carefully selected for the work to be performed, but are actually, shaped, be it ever so crudely, to suit the job.\n\nClearly we must shift the boundary between man and beast, distinguishing the former as the creature who artificially improves his tools. But even here it is not absolutely certain that the boundary will stand. Wilhelm Boelsche, a well-known German writer on natural history, calls attention to the \u201cblacksmith woodpecker\u201d which will thrust hard pine nuts into cracks in the trunk of a tree, so that they are held as if in a vise, enabling the bird to operate upon the seed more easily. Furthermore, this woodpecker will actually make a hole in the tree to receive the nut if there is not a hole or crack handy, so that evidently this animal does produce or artificially improve the tool that it uses.\n\nThere are a few such examples in nature, just enough to cast a bit of uncertainty on the boundary we have set. But although the actual line of demarcation may not be clear, there is no question but that the lowest type of humanity now existent, or of which we have any record, is or was a tool maker. Chipped stones evidently fashioned by man for some useful purpose are found even in the remains of the Middle Tertiary Epoch. The spirit of inquiry, of experiment, of invention, and the ambition to dominate over other members of the animal kingdom or over the obstacles imposed by nature, are to be found more or less active among all peoples, no matter how lowly a position they may occupy in the scale of civilization.\n\n[12]\n\nWAR AS A STIMULUS OF INVENTION\nThe most primitive implements were probably developed for the purpose of war. From the very earliest times, down to the present day, war has been a most potent stimulus of invention. The first tools ever used were probably intended to enable the user to cope with dangerous enemies. They marked the first stage in the conquest of brain over mere brawn. The primitive weapons were used not only in fighting other men, but in fighting off dangerous animals, and then in hunting animals for food. No doubt the first implement ever used was a club, which gave a real advantage over the unarmed, scratching, tearing, and biting enemy. This was a lever which increased the reach of the fighter, and also increased the power of his blow. The heavier the club, the more dangerous the weapon, particularly when most of the weight was centered at the outer end of the stick. But he was a real genius who first fastened a rock to the end of his club.\n\nTHE ART OF BREAKING STONES\nThen arose the art of breaking stones\u2014breaking them skillfully, so as to form a jagged cutting edge. When man began to fashion tools of stone he left imperishable records of his craftsmanship which enable us to trace his progress in invention. The first finished tool we find was the fist hatchet\u2014a stone roughly chipped to form a cutting edge and of convenient shape for the grasp of the hand. This primitive tool very slowly, through a period covering thousands of years, developed into all manner of cutting implements, some with handles of wood and bone. The ax head was followed by the spearhead[13] and this finally by the arrowhead, showing that man had at last found a mechanical substitute for his muscles to hurl projectiles farther and with greater accuracy than he could throw them by hand.\n\nWe marvel at the resourcefulness and skill of the primitive savage in working so difficult a material as stone. It would baffle a modern mechanic to be required to shape a piece of flint into an arrowhead with no other tool than a piece of bone. He is so accustomed to using tools which are harder than the material they are intended to shape that he cannot conceive of making any impression upon a piece of flint with a piece of bone, to say nothing of a stick of hard wood, and yet such tools were used away back in the Stone Age. At first stones were roughly shaped by hammering them together. Then the artisans became more skilled. They discovered that certain stones could be chipped more regularly and evenly, and the art of flaking off chips of flint sprang up. Some specimens that belonged to ages long preceding that of recorded history are beautifully done. The spearheads are symmetrically shaped like a long narrow leaf, and the stone is evenly furrowed on both sides with a keen edge all around.\n\nNot only did primitive artisans shape the stone implements with hammer blows, but they learned how to shape stone by pressure as well, using a tool that was relatively soft. It is not a very difficult matter to shape even so hard a substance as glass merely by pressure. If a piece of glass is laid on a table with its edge slightly overhanging that of the table, it is possible to chip off the overhanging edge by pressing a nail or even a hard stick of wood against this edge. A small flake of glass is thus removed, and, by continuing the process, arrowheads of any[14] shape may be formed. The tool is placed not against the upper surface of the glass, but against the edge of the glass, so that only the lower surface of it is split or flaked off. Then the glass is turned over and a chip is taken off the opposite face.\n\nIn the Middle Stone Age we find the primitive craftsman equipped with a very complete assortment of stone tools. He had hammers, chisels, scrapers, drills, and polishing tools. He knew how to make useful household implements, such as spoons and ladles, out of bone. He polished his work and ornamented the implements with carvings of animals. Ivory pins and needles show that he had begun to make himself clothing from the skins of animals and that he sewed them together with thongs or tendons.\n\nIn the Late Stone Age he had learned how to make vessels of fire-baked clay. His axes were ground to a sharp edge, and he bored holes in the ax head to receive the ax handle. The Swiss lake dwellers built houses of wood and fitted them with all sorts of wooden furniture carved with stone tools. Among the remains of these interesting settlements may be found balls of clay which, from the fact that one of them was discovered with a spool of flax still attached to it, were evidently used as spinning \u201cwhorls\u201d used for spinning flax into thread. Clothing of skins was giving way to or being supplemented with clothing of woven fabric.\n\nDISCOVERY OF THE LEVER AND THE WEDGE\nPrior to the Stone Age the club was undoubtedly used, in time of peace\u2014if there ever was a time of peace in those days\u2014to batter down trees, to beat through entanglements and to dislodge great stones.[15] Here the first idea of leverage was evidently employed. The club with a rock tied to it, particularly if the rock was shaped with a sharp edge, made a better implement for hewing trees. It is quite probable that soon after this stage of development had been reached, some one discovered the use of the wedge, particularly in splitting timber. Of course, no one realized in those early days why it was that he could pry up a greater weight with a lever than he could lift directly by hand, or why he could split open a log by driving wedges into it. The art of mechanics was in existence long ages before science of mechanics began to be studied. But it was not until men began to look into the why of things that rapid progress was made.\n\nWe can go on endlessly with our speculations on the evolution of tools and machinery up to the time when historians began to record the mechanical achievements of man. Unfortunately even after historians began to write they were so filled with admiration for the destructive work of man that they had no time to record his constructive work. The warrior who spread havoc and terror received all the glory, and his deeds were written on parchment, inscribed in clay and carved in stone; but the humble artisan was not worthy of mention. Even when the science of mechanics came to be studied, it was shrouded in a veil of mystery, and it was beneath the dignity of the man of science to impart his knowledge to the artisan. There was a lack of cooperation between science and industry that has persisted to a certain extent even up to the present time. Some of the most ingenious inventions of the ancients were employed by a corrupt and crafty priesthood to produce apparently miraculous effects[16] and hoodwink the general public; and so, in looking back to the early days of mechanics, we are obliged to draw upon our imagination to trace its evolution, supplementing this by a study of the tools of primitive people of more recent time. Practically every form of hand tool we now use must have been known to the ancient artisan.\n\nINVENTION OF THE WHEEL\nWe are not going to attempt to write a history of the evolution of machinery, but there is one invention whose origin is lost in the remote prehistoric ages which deserves more than passing attention. It is a pity that we have no clue as to who invented the wheel or how this most important element that enters into the construction of nearly all machinery was evolved. The invention called for a remarkable degree of originality. There is nothing like a wheel in nature. Levers we have in our own physical frame. But a wheel is something that is distinctly a human creation. Whoever invented it must have been a real genius, a James Watt or a Thomas Edison of his day. Certainly we owe more to the invention of the wheel than we do even to so revolutionary a machine as the steam engine, or the flying machine. How it was ever first conceived is a mystery. Maybe this primeval genius got his idea from seeing a stone rolling downhill, or he may have seen a tumbling weed rolling along the ground before the wind. It may be that the forerunner of the wheel was a roller shaped out of a log, for certainly primitive civilization must have advanced enough to have known how to hew timber before it would have been capable of fashioning a wheel. Some observant man might have noticed that he could drag a heavy[17] timber over a rolling log much more easily than he could along the bare ground, and gradually the roller evolved into a wheel.\n\nWe can speculate upon the evolution of vehicles and transportation, once the wheel was invented. Of course, the first method of transporting loads was to carry them in the arms. Possibly loads were placed on skids and dragged along by one end. Away back in early times, it was discovered that two persons could carry more than twice as much as one, if the load were placed on a couple of poles. There was no friction to contend with, and not only was the load cut in two, because each man bore half of it, but the position of the load was such that it could be borne more easily. After the wheel was discovered, some one must have conceived of the idea of dispensing with an assistant by placing a wheel between the poles of the stretcher, thus making a crude wheelbarrow. It is more likely that two wheels were first used, making a cart of the stretcher, because the crude workmen of those days could hardly have produced anything but a very wobbly wheelbarrow. At any rate, the wheel, or pair of wheels, robbed one man of his job. Only one bearer was required where before two had been used. Labor costs were immediately reduced 50 per cent.\n\nDISPLACING MEN WITH MACHINES\nIn the very earliest days of invention machines began to displace men. Had there been unions in those days, no doubt there would have been strenuous opposition to the introduction of this substitute for an honest worker. But among the ancients, even more than at the present time, invention meant greater production rather than less work, because[18] the laborer of that time was not a hired man but a slave. There was no object in cutting down labor when it cost practically nothing. The only stimulus to invention was greater production.\n\nThe invention of the wheel meant the dawn of transportation, which is the backbone of civilization, and from it resulted no end of other inventions. It made it possible for communities to come into closer touch with each other. It meant circulation\u2014an interchange of knowledge and of products. Food was transported from one locality to another, enabling certain communities to dispense with agricultural work and specialize in certain lines of manufacture; for they could barter their products for food raised by other communities. There are some tribes to-day which are most backward because they are separated from other tribes by rivers, while other tribes similarly placed owe their progress to the fact that they have developed sufficient skill to build crude bridges and thus gain access to the outside world.\n\nRAISING WATER\nIn Egypt the wheel had a wonderful effect on agriculture. In that dry land water is, and always has been, most precious. No wonder the Nile was venerated! It meant life\u2014life to crops, and hence life to man. How to raise water from this stream of life in time of drought was the great problem of the Egyptian. As slave labor was cheap, it was customary to haul up the precious water, a bucket at a time, and pour it over the fields. Then some one discovered that this process could be simplified by using a shadoof or swape; in other words, a long pole fulcrumed near one end, with a heavy rock for a counterbalance lashed to the shorter arm, and a bucket[19] tied by a long rope to the longer arm of the lever. This primitive machine is still to be found in some rural districts. With this contrivance, a heavier load could be lifted than by hand, because, when raising the bucket, the weight of the rock would assist in lifting the water. After the swape came all manner of ingenious devices for lifting the water. There were seesaw arrangements which would scoop up some of the water at each oscillation of the seesaw, and in one ingenious contrivance there was a succession of seesaws by which the water was raised to a considerable height, whence it poured down into ditches that irrigated the fields.\n\nThen some one invented a water wheel or a great wheel, fitted with buckets, which was turned by human or ox power, and which poured a steady stream of water into the irrigating ditches.\n\nBut the greatest invention was that of the engineer who actually made the river turn the wheel. It was probably on the Nile that the noria, as this machine was called, was first put into service.\n\nThe wheel was provided with paddles, so that the current made it revolve, and the water spilled out of the buckets into a trough as they were turned over by the wheel. We can imagine the triumph of the ancient inventor who developed that machine. True, the river might arise in its wrath now and then and wreck the machine, but in wrecking the wheel it had to flood the land, which, after all, was exactly what was aimed at. The anger of the river was short-lived; it soon quieted down and went on placidly turning the wheel which robbed it of the precious water. It was a great event in the history of engineering. The Nile had been harnessed. One of the great powers of nature had been set to work.\n\n[20]\n\nCHAPTER II\nTHE ANATOMY OF A MACHINE\n\nEVERY animal is a complex machine, provided with its own motive power and a brain for directing the operation of its own mechanical elements. Not satisfied with the mechanism that nature has put into the human machine, man has reached for other elements and devised mechanisms of his own in order to supplement the human machine and increase its efficiency. At first, as we have seen, these elements were hand tools of the crudest sort; but they were gradually improved and then they were combined into what we term machines. In developing these machines, he naturally took his own system as a pattern and was guided to a large extent by an examination of his own physical structure. We see this very clearly in the names of the different parts of machinery, which are taken from the names of similar parts in the human frame. Almost every member of the body is used in mechanical terminology. For instance, we have the \u201chead\u201d and the \u201cfoot,\u201d the \u201carms\u201d and the \u201clegs,\u201d the \u201cfingers\u201d and the \u201cankles,\u201d \u201celbows,\u201d \u201cshoulders,\u201d \u201ctrunk,\u201d \u201chips,\u201d and various parts of the face, such as the \u201ceyes,\u201d \u201cears,\u201d \u201cnose,\u201d \u201cmouth,\u201d \u201cteeth,\u201d \u201clips,\u201d and even the \u201cgums,\u201d to indicate parts of machinery which have some remote resemblance to these features.\n\nBefore we can understand machinery we must have some general knowledge of the elements of[21] which it is composed. Probably most of the readers of this book already possess a fair knowledge of machine elements and mechanical movements and they can well afford to skip this chapter. However, for the benefit of the uninitiated, we must put a machine on the operating table, dissect it, and explain its anatomical structure. We cannot attempt a very detailed study, but will confine ourselves to the most important elements.\n\nEvery machine is made up of movable parts and fixed parts, the latter serving to guide or constrain the motion of the former; for no combination of elements will constitute a machine unless the parts are constrained to move in certain predetermined directions.\n\nTHE LEVER\nAmong the moving elements the first to be considered is the lever, which really forms a broad classification comprising many elements that will hardly be recognized as levers at first blush. Levers in some form are to be found in practically every machine. A wheel, a gear, and a pulley are really levers in disguise, as will be explained presently.\n\nOf course everyone knows that a simple lever consists of a rigid bar that swings on a fulcrum. The fulcrum may be a knife edge, a shaft passing through the bar or any element on which the bar can be swung or oscillated. The purpose of the lever is to give a certain advantage in the application of a force to a load. This may be a change of speed and distance of travel, and hence of power, or merely a change of direction.\n\n[22]\n\n\nFIG. 1.\u2014THREE ORDERS OF SIMPLE LEVERS\n\nThere are three types or orders of levers produced by varying the relative positions of the points where the fulcrum, the force or effort, and the weight or load are applied. These are shown in Figure 1. In the lever of the first order the fulcrum is placed between the effort and the weight; in the lever of the second order the weight is applied between the fulcrum and the effort; and in the lever of the third order the effort is applied between the fulcrum and the weight. In each case that part of the lever which extends from the fulcrum to the point where the effort is applied is called the effort arm, and that which extends from the fulcrum to the point where the weight is supported is the weight arm. The weight that can be lifted with a given effort depends upon the ratio of the effort arm to the weight arm. If the two arms are of equal length, the effort is equal to the weight, but twice the weight can be lifted with the same effort if the effort arm is twice as long as the weight arm. You can lift a ton with[23] an effort of only 100 pounds if your effort arm is twenty times as long as your weight arm but the end of your effort arm would have to move twenty inches to raise the ton weight one inch. We are assuming in all these cases that the lever itself has no weight and that there is no friction at the fulcrum.\n\nOf course levers are not used merely for the purpose of lifting weight, but to overcome any resistance or merely to apply pressure upon an object. In almost every household we may find examples of the three orders of levers. A pair of shears, for instance, is composed of two levers of the first order, swinging on a common fulcrum. The effort is applied at the handles, and the weight or load is the material that is cut by the blades or, speaking more technically, the handles are the effort arms and the blades are the weight arms. A material that is too tough to be cut at the tip ends of the blades may be easily cut if we move it in near the fulcrum or pin that hinges the blades together; for by doing this we shorten the weight arms, because the weight arm is measured not to the end of the blade, but to the point where it is cutting into the material. To cut very tough material, such as heavy tin or sheet steel, we use long-handled short-bladed shears. The cutting pressure depends upon the ratio of the effort arm to the weight arm. If the effort arms are twice as long as the weight arms, the cutting pressure is twice as great as that applied at the handles.\n\nA nutcracker consists of a pair of levers of the second order. The fulcrum is at one end and the effort or pressure is applied at the opposite end of the levers or handles, while the equivalent of the weight (in this case the nut) is placed between the effort and the fulcrum. Again the effort arm is[24] measured from the fulcrum or hinge pin of the tool to the point where the hand pressure is applied, and the weight arm is measured from the fulcrum to the nut. The effort arm may be four or five times as long as the weight arm, so that the pressure exerted on the nut is four or five times as great as that exerted by the hand on the ends of the handles.\n\n\nFIG. 2.\u2014AN ANGULAR OR BELL-CRANK LEVER\n\nIn the case of a pair of sugar tongs we have another tool something like the nutcracker in construction, but here the weight, i.e., the lump of sugar, is seized by the ends of the tongs while the hand pressure is applied somewhere between the fulcrum and the weight. Hence we have here a lever or pair of levers of the third order. The effort arm of a pair of tongs is always shorter than the weight arm and the pressure on the sugar lump is always less than that exerted on the tongs by the hand. Evidently the most powerful tool of the three is the nutcracker, because the effort arms extend over the full length of the tool and are always longer than the weight arms.\n\nA lever need not consist of a straight bar; the effort arm may form an angle with the weight arm, forming what is known as an angular or bell-crank[25] lever (Figure 2). When a common claw hammer is used to pull out a nail, the claws that slip under the head of the nail form the weight arm and the hammer handle the effort arm. A horizontal pull on the handle produces a vertical lift on the nail.\n\nSometimes two or more levers are interconnected, as in Figure 3, the effort arm of one being linked to the weight arm of the other. This serves to increase the lifting force at the weight and at the same time keep the mechanism within compact limits. Such compounding can go on indefinitely and is subject to all sorts of variations.\n\n\nFIG. 3.\u2014COMPOUND LEVERAGE\n\nOne thing we must not forget, and it is a matter that is commonly overlooked by perpetual motion cranks, namely, that while a pound of pressure on the effort arm may be made to lift two, four, or a hundred times as many pounds on the weight arm by varying the relative length of these arms, it has to move two, four, or a hundred times as far as the weight arm, so that the work done on one side of the fulcrum is always exactly equal to that done on the other side.\n\n[26]\n\nCONTINUOUS REVOLVING LEVERAGE\n\nFIG. 4.\u2014PRIMITIVE GEAR WHEELS\u2014TWO COACTING GROUPS OF LEVERS\n\nIf we take a number of levers radiating from a common fulcrum like the spokes of a carriage wheel, we have a primitive gear wheel. Two such groups of levers may be mounted on parallel shafts so that when one is turned its spokes will successively engage the spokes of the other group and make the latter turn (see Figure 4). Each spoke is first an effort arm on one side of the wheel and then a weight arm as it turns around to the other side of the wheel, and as the effort arms and weight arms are of the same length there is no multiplication of power. A pound on one side of the wheel cannot lift more than a pound on the other. The driven wheel receives the same power as the driving wheel except for such loss as may be due to friction at the bearings or where the spokes contact. The only advantage of such a pair of gears is that the direction of rotation of the driven wheel is the reverse of that of the driving wheel. If the spokes of one wheel are longer than those of the other, we have at once a variation in the rate of rotation proportional to the relative diameters of the two wheels. In Figure 5, for instance,[27] the diameter of the driving wheel A is twice the diameter of the driven gear B, and so, for each revolution of A, B must make two revolutions, i.e., the driver must make two revolutions for each revolution of the driven wheel. In other words, the speed of revolution is doubled. However, if we make B the driver the speed of the driven wheel A will be half of that of wheel B.\n\n\nFIG. 5.\u2014COACTING LEVERS OF UNEQUAL LENGTH\n\nIn primitive machines spoke gears were seldom mounted on parallel shafts because of the difficulty of keeping the spokes in alignment. Instead, one shaft was mounted at right angles to the other so that one set of spokes would cross the other (Figure 6), thus producing the equivalent of a bevel gear. This was of advantage in changing the plane of rotation. A later development was the barrel or lantern gear, which permitted transfer of power without changing the plane of rotation. A cylindrical bundle of rods constituted one of the wheels (as shown in Figure 7). Instead of being crudely formed of spokes, the other wheel sometimes consisted of a[28] disk with pins radiating from its rim. Such gears in far more refined form are still used in modern clocks and watches. A still further development for transmitting motion to a plane at right angles to that of the driving shaft is shown in Figure 8. Here we have a crown gear in which the pins instead of radiating from the periphery of the disk project from the side face of the gear.\n\n\nFIG. 6.\u2014PRIMITIVE EQUIVALENT OF THE BEVEL GEAR\n\n\nFIG. 7.\u2014PRIMITIVE LANTERN GEAR\n\nTurning back to our first spoked wheels, it is very evident that we may put a rim over the spokes or even fill in between the spokes and convert the wheels into solid disks that are in frictional engagement with each other without getting away from the fact that we are dealing with levers. Each wheel, then, consists of a continuous revolving lever. Friction gears are used quite commonly in machinery when it is desirable to have the wheels slip if subjected to excessive strain.\n\n[29]\n\nTOOTHED GEARS\nBy forming teeth on one gear to mesh between similar teeth on the other, we convert the friction gears into a pair of spur gears (Figure 9). We need not go into the intricacies of the form of gear teeth. They are designed to be in continuous rolling contact while they are in mesh. The novice is apt to call all spur gears \u201ccogwheels\u201d and gear-teeth \u201ccogs.\u201d Mechanics, however, recognize a difference between cog wheels and spur wheels. In the former, the teeth, or cogs, are not cast upon or cut out of the wheel body, but are separate pieces fitted to the wheel. Such wheels are found in old water mills. They consist of wooden wheels with iron or steel teeth mortised in the wooden rim of the wheel. In general it is safer to speak of spur gears because there are few cogwheels now in use.\n\n\nFIG. 8.\u2014CROWN AND LANTERN GEAR\n\nWhen a small gear engages a large one, the former is commonly known as a pinion.\n\n[30]\n\n\nFIG. 9.\u2014SPUR AND PINION GEAR\n\n\nFIG. 10.\u2014BEVEL FRICTION GEARS\n\nIf two friction wheels are to turn at right angles one to the other, they must have conical bearing surfaces, as in Figure 10. The angle between the shafts of the two gears and the relative size of the gears may be changed as desired, provided each cone surface has its apex at the intersection of the two shafts or axes. It is easy to understand how such conical friction gears may be converted into toothed bevel gears (Figure 11), by forming teeth on the conical[31] surfaces, and it will be evident that the teeth must taper toward the apex of the two cones. Two bevel gears of equal diameter, and with shafts set at right angles one to the other, are known as miter gears.\n\n\nFIG. 11.\u2014TOOTHED BEVEL GEARS\n\nSo far we have not shown any combination of gearing that will multiply power. In Figure 5, the driver A is twice the diameter of the driven wheel B, and the latter makes two revolutions for one of A, but the speed at the periphery of the two wheels is the same. A pull of one pound at the point a produces a pressure of one pound at b, and this in turn produces a lift of one pound at c because the levers in each wheel are perfectly balanced, that is, each lever has equal effort and weight arms. The way to obtain an increase of power and of peripheral speed is to fasten two wheels of unequal diameters together on the same center and apply the effort to one of the wheels (as in Figure 12) and the weight to the other wheel. This gives us what is technically known as a wheel and axle. The dotted lines show that we have here a lever of the first order which can be used to multiply power in the same way that a bar lever does. If one wheel is twice the diameter[32] of the other then a pound of effort will lift two pounds of weight.\n\n\nFIG. 12.\u2014WHEEL AND AXLE OR REVOLVING LEVER OF FIRST ORDER\n\n\nFIG. 13.\u2014REVOLVING LEVERS OF THE 2D AND 3D ORDER\n\nFigure 13 shows how the effort and weight can be shifted about in such fashion as to give us a lever of the second and one of the third order. The power may be enormously increased and the speed of the final wheel greatly reduced by setting up a train of gears in which the effort is received by the larger one of each couple and is delivered by the smaller one. In Figure 14 the smaller wheels are half the diameter of the larger ones. A pound of pressure at A will amount to 2 at B, 4 at C, 8 at D, 16 at E, and 32 at F. On the other hand, point A will have to move through 32 inches to make the point F move an inch.\n\n\nRAISING WATER WITH A CHAIN OF POTS\n\nA primitive pump still used in Egypt\n\n\nA HORSE-OPERATED CHAIN-PUMP USED IN GREECE\n\n\nMULTIPLE SPINDLE DRILL IN MOTOR CAR FACTORY\n\n[33]\n\n\nFIG. 14.\u2014A TRAIN OF SPUR GEARS\n\n\nFIG. 15.\u2014PULLEYS OF THE 1ST, 2D, AND 3D ORDERS\n\n[34]\n\nFIG. 16.\u2014TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT OF BLOCK AND TACKLE\n\nA pulley is merely a modification of the wheel. Figure 15 shows how it may be arranged to correspond to the three orders of simple levers. If the pulley axis is fixed, as in the first order, the effort and weight arms are equal and hence balanced. In the second order the wheel is bodily movable, hence one pound will raise two pounds of weight because the power arm is twice as long as the weight arm, while in the third order it takes two pounds of lift to raise one pound of weight. There is no end of possible combinations of pulleys which will multiply power in the same way that bar levers do when compounded. A common arrangement of block and tackle is given in Figure 16. There is a four-sheave pulley block above and a three-sheave block below, but in order to trace the rope clearly the pulley wheels or sheaves are represented as of different diameters. The arrangement consists of a series of levers of the first order in the upper pulley block coupled to a series of levers of the second order in the lower block. To find the weight that a given[35] power will lift, multiply the effort by the number of strands of rope that are supporting the weight. In this case there are seven such strands, not counting the strand E, to which the effort or pull is applied. This means that a pull of a hundred pounds at E will lift 700 pounds at W. Of course a pull of seven feet at E will raise the weight only one foot.\n\n\nFIG. 17.\u2014INCLINED PLANE WITH EFFORT PARALLEL TO THE INCLINED FACE\n\nTHE INCLINED PLANE AND ITS FAMILY\nThe inclined plane constitutes a second broad classification of machine elements. The wedge, the screw, the cam, and the eccentric, all belong to the family of the inclined plane.\n\n[36]\n\n\nFIG. 18.\u2014INCLINED PLANE WITH EFFORT PARALLEL TO THE BASE\n\nA simple form of inclined plane is pictured in Figure 17, which shows a weight W being rolled up an incline. The effort required to carry it to the top of the incline depends, of course, upon the steepness of the incline. The drawing shows a rise of 3 feet on a slope 5 feet long, and the weight of the wheel is, say 20 pounds. To find the effort required, the weight is multiplied by the rise (20 \u00d7 3 = 60) and divided by the length of the slope (60/5 = 12) and we find that it takes only 12 pounds to roll the 20-pound wheel to the top of the incline. This holds true when the pull is parallel to the inclined face. If the pull is parallel to the base of the incline, as in Figure 18, we must divide by the length of the base instead of the length of the incline (60/4 = 15) and we find that it takes 15 pounds of effort to pull the weight up the incline. If the pull is exerted at an angle both to the base and the inclined face, we have a problem that is slightly more complicated and we need not go into it here because it involves a bit of trigonometry. In all cases, however, it may be noted that the amount of rope that is taken in, in hauling the weight up the incline, bears a definite relation to the amount of effort required to raise the weight. In Figure 17, 5 feet of rope must be pulled in, in order to raise the weight 3 feet, so that \u2157 of 20 or 12 pounds is all that is required to pull up the weight, while in Figure 18, 4 feet of rope is hauled in for a lift of 3 feet, so that \u00be of 20 or 15 pounds is required to pull up the weight. In this[37] respect the inclined plane is exactly like the lever or the pulley, for the effort multiplied by the distance through which it is exerted is always exactly equal to the weight multiplied by the distance through which it moves. Thus in Figure 17, the effort 12 pounds multiplied by the distance 5 = the weight 20 pounds times the distance 3, and in Figure 18, effort 15 x distance 4 = weight 20 x distance 3. Of course, we are ignoring the weight of the rope and the friction which, in actual practice, are important factors to be reckoned with.\n\n\nFIG. 19.\u2014ENDLESS SCREW OR WORM GEAR\n\nSo far we have considered a fixed inclined plane, but when the inclined plane is moved between the weight and a fixed base it is known as a wedge, and in this case, too, the effort required to move the wedge multiplied by the distance the wedge moves is equal to the weight multiplied by the distance it is lifted.\n\nThe commonest form of inclined plane is the screw which is merely an inclined plane bent around a[38] cylinder. A screw engaging a toothed wheel, as in Figure 19, gives a combination known as an \u201cendless screw,\u201d or, more commonly, as a worm gear. The screw or worm is always the driver, and as it must make a complete turn to move the gear through a space of one tooth, the power of this combination is very great. It is practically impossible to turn the worm by using the gear wheel as a driver because the friction developed at the point where the worm and gear contact is very great. For this reason worm gearing is used in the steering gear of automobiles. The shaft of the steering wheel is fitted with a worm which meshes with a worm gear on the parts connected with the wheels. It is very easy to turn the wheels by operating the steering wheel, but if the wheels strike a rut or a stone they are not deflected from their course, because the worm makes it impossible for them to turn the steering wheel.\n\n\nFIG. 20.\u2014HELICAL OR SPIRAL GEARS\n\nThe spiral gear shown in Figure 20 is a cross between a worm gear and spur gear. The teeth are[39] spirals set at an angle of 45 degrees to the axis of the wheel. In this case either gear can be used to drive the other, and the advantage of such a pair is that power is transmitted from one shaft to another in a different plane and at right angles to the first.\n\n\nFIG. 21.\u2014DRUM CAM\n\n\nFIG. 22.\u2014PROFILE OR DISK CAM\n\nCams are usually irregular revolving inclined planes. Figure 21, shows a cylinder or drum cam. A groove is cut in the cylindrical wall of the cam and an arm or lever is provided with a roller which[40] rolls in the groove. When the cam is revolved the lever is constrained to follow all the twists and turns of the groove. A different form of cam is shown in Figure 22. It is formed with an irregular periphery against which the roller is pressed by a spring. As the cam wheel revolves, the roller and the arm to which it is attached must move in and out over all the hills and valleys of the periphery. The cam is one of the most useful elements in modern machinery, for it provides a very simple means of producing the most complicated and irregular motions.\n\n\nFIG. 23.\u2014ECCENTRIC BY WHICH ROTARY MOTION IS CONVERTED INTO RECTILINEAR MOTION\n\nWe cannot attempt to describe all the different types of cams, but reference should be made to the eccentric, which is a form of cam commonly used to operate the valves of a steam engine. The cam in this case is a perfectly circular disk, but the shaft that turns it does not lie at the center of the disk, consequently an object bearing against the periphery must move toward and away from the center as the disk revolves. Instead of using a spring-pressed roller to bear against one side of the disk, the whole disk is encircled with a ring of steel known as an[41] eccentric strap. This strap is bolted to a valve rod and as the eccentric revolves the strap makes the valve rod move back and forth. (See Figure 23.)\n\nA description of all the various combinations of gearing, link motions, ratchets, escapements, clutches, and miscellaneous movements would easily fill the rest of this book, and we must therefore content ourselves with this very brief survey of a few of the more important elements employed in the construction of modern machinery.\n\n[42]\n\nCHAPTER III\nMACHINES FOR MAKING MACHINES\n\nWHILE we may glory in the wonderful mechanical progress of to-day, we must not overlook the marvelous skill of the ancient artisan nor forget that it is to his inventive genius that we are indebted for practically every hand tool we possess. Only a few special tools owe their origin to the modern inventor. All the rest date back beyond the twilight of history. We have merely improved upon these tools by slight changes of design or the employment of better materials in their construction.\n\nAs users of these tools we cannot begin to compare with the skilled workman of ancient days. Our progress is shown not in the development of skill, but in the loss of it. We have taken the tool out of the human hand and put it into an inanimate machine. It is only very recently that the tool was delivered to the machine and that act marked the dawn of the present remarkable mechanical era.\n\nMachines for making machines date back to the time of the early Egyptians. They had their pole lathes and bow drills, but these machines only partially relieved the workman of his labors, and the quality of the work still depended upon a degree of skill that was acquired only through years of patient apprenticeship.\n\nThe pole lathe, by the way, consisted merely of a pair of centers between which the work was[43] mounted, a pole attached to the ceiling and a strap or rope passed around the work and fastened at one end to a pole and at the other to a pedal resting against the floor. (See Figure 24.) When the pedal was depressed, the strap was pulled down and the work was revolved. On releasing the pedal, the spring of the pole pulled the strap up and reversed the rotation of the work. Thus by alternately depressing and releasing the pedal, the work was intermittently revolved against a chisel which was rested on a block and guided by the workman. Small work could be turned out on such a lathe with considerable precision, but when it came to large parts, particularly parts of steel, the workman was easily tired by the effort of operating the pedal and was apt to be irregular in the guiding of the tool.\n\n\nFIG. 24.\u2014PRIMITIVE POLE LATHE\n\nUp to the middle of the eighteenth century practically no advance had been made over the ancient[44] lathe of the Egyptians, and when, 150 years ago, the steam engine was invented the task of building the engine seemed almost insuperable.\n\nJames Watt was a maker of mathematical instruments, a man of great skill and precision as a craftsman, but he dealt with parts of small dimensions. When he conceived of his steam engine, he mentally pictured the various parts as turned out with all the accuracy and finish that was possible in the diminutive members of a scientific instrument. To him it seemed perfectly feasible to turn a cylinder which would be practically perfect in contour, and to fit it with a piston around which no steam could leak. With the lathe then in existence such a fit was easily possible on small work. But when he undertook to have the cylinder of his engine bored, he discovered that there was no machine that could begin to do the work properly. In fact, when Smeaton, who was a prominent engineer of that time, investigated Watt\u2019s steam engine, he declared that it was such a complicated piece of work that neither tools nor workmen existed that could build it. In Watt\u2019s first engine, the cylinder was only six inches in diameter and two feet long, and a special type of boring machine was devised to bore the forged cylinders. But the boring was so irregular that when the piston was inserted and the steam was turned on, nothing would stop the flow of steam that leaked around the piston. In vain did James Watt use cork, oiled rags, tow, paper, and even old hats to stop the leakage. However, the boring machine was improved and later a cylinder, eighteen inches in diameter, was bored with such accuracy that the large diameter exceeded the small diameter in the worst place by only \u215c of an inch. This Watt considered a very good bit[45] of turning. To-day cylinders of that size that vary from true by half the thickness of the paper that this is printed on would be thrown out as defective.\n\nIt was in 1769 that Watt invented the steam engine, but that great event did not mark the dawn of the present era of machinery. For a quarter of a century thereafter there was little progress in the development of machine tools. A boring machine was built that did fair work. There were a few sawmills in which wind power was employed to drive the saw. But lathes were still driven by foot power and the cutting tool was still held and guided by hand.\n\nMAUDSLEY\u2019S \u201cGO-CART\u201d\nThe real father of the present era was a very clever British mechanical engineer, Henry Maudsley, who undertook to eliminate the uncertainties of the human hand by clamping the cutting tool of the lathe in a rest and arranging the rest to slide along the length of the lathe or transversely toward or away from the center. These two motions made it possible to accomplish all that the workman could accomplish by hand and at the same time the tool was held so firmly that accuracy and precision of turning was assured. Furthermore, he provided this slide rest with a nut that engaged a screw driven through suitable gearing by the lathe spindle. Then, as the work revolved, the slide rest was compelled to move along the bed of the lathe at a uniform rate. By varying the gearing, the speed of the slide rest and the tool it carried could be varied at will, thus making it possible to cut screw threads of any pitch desired with a degree of accuracy unattainable by hand.\n\n[46]\n\nRemarkable as was this improvement, it met with the usual opposition that every real advance in machinery received in those days. People referred to the slide rest as Maudsley\u2019s \u201cgo-cart,\u201d but it proved such an important element of the lathe and so very valuable that before long it was universally adopted. From that time on the skill of the workman began to lose its importance. The man began to give way to the machine. Precision was possible in large as well as small work. The human element was also dispensed with in the driving of the lathe. The foot pedal was superseded by the steam engine, and the machine came to be known as the engine lathe.\n\nThere are many ways of working metals now in common use. Metals may be cast in a molten state, or they may be pressed and molded into shape in a cold state, or they may be hammered either cold or hot, but in nearly all cases in which metal is removed in order to form a piece of work, the chisel is used as a cutting instrument. This is perfectly apparent in lathes and planers, but not quite so apparent in sawing, drilling, filing, and grinding. A drill is merely a spiral chisel which revolves upon its own center. A saw is a gang of tiny chisels, and a file consists of still smaller chisels which are broader than those of the saw. In grinding we have rough surfaces in which particles of emery or carborundum act as tiny chisels. The shears, the punch, and the cutting torch are practically the only exceptions to the rule that metals are always cut by chisels, and even the shears may be conceived as consisting of a pair of broad coacting chisels, while it takes little imagination to see a form of chisel in the punch. The cutting torch is, of course, in no sense a chisel.\n\n[47]\n\nIn the cutting of metals the work may move against a fixed tool or the tool may move against a fixed piece of work. In a lathe, it is the work that revolves or rotates against the tool. In the drill and the milling machine the tool revolves against the work.\n\nIn the planer, the tool is fixed and the work slides against it. The shaper reverses the operation; the work is fixed and the tool moves in a rectilinear direction.\n\nUp to the nineteenth century practically the only machines for cutting metals were the lathe and a crude form of boring machine. The machinists of that day had not reached the stage where they were able to produce anything but round work on a machine. The planer had not been born. It was for this reason that Watt had a great deal of difficulty in getting rectilinear motion for the piston of his engine. He had to invent a complicated system of links and levers in order to obtain a practically parallel motion to guide his piston in and out of the cylinder. When the planer was invented and it was possible to produce straight surfaces with a considerable degree of accuracy, all of Watt\u2019s ingenious parallel motions, went into the discard and the cross-head and guides took their place.\n\nIt was not until long after the planer had been invented that Eli Whitney, the American genius of cotton-gin fame, conceived the milling machine. He reversed the operation of the lathe by placing the cutting tool on the revolving spindle and sliding the work against it. Milling cutters consist of wheels formed with a number of cutting edges or chisels which are arranged either on the periphery of the wheel or on the face of the wheel.\n\n[48]\n\nFollowing the milling machine, came the grinder, in which a revolving wheel of an abrasive material served to wear away the surface of a piece of work, and with this form of machine steels of great hardness could be finished with accuracy and a high polish.\n\nTHE INTERCHANGEABLE SYSTEM\nThe most notable advance in machine work came early in the nineteenth century, when what was known as the \u201cAmerican System\u201d of manufacture, or the interchangeable system, was introduced. As long as mechanics were obliged to perform their operations largely by hand, it was impossible to attain great accuracy. Each workman put his own individuality into the work. As a consequence, no two pieces were of exactly the same size or shape. This was true even with the early power-driven machine tools. The parts might be very close to the same size, but careful measurements showed that they varied by a minute fraction of an inch. Hence, when a machine was assembled the unyielding metal parts had to be filed and trimmed and hammered to fit them together. If any accident occurred to a machine, the damaged part could not be replaced by another taken from stock. The entire machine had to go back to the shop where an experienced mechanic would make a new part to replace the damaged one. In those days a machine was not manufactured but was built as an individual mechanism, just as a house or a boat is built to-day.\n\nWith the advent of accurate machine tools came the idea of standardizing the parts so that hundreds and thousands of pieces could be made of exactly the same dimensions, and in assembling a machine the parts could be picked at random from the stock[49] and put together without the use of special tools and without requiring any special fitting. This was of special importance in the tools of warfare, because armies need quantity production, i. e., rifles, cannon, etc. More machines of the same kind were required for an army than for any other organization or line of work. At the close of the Napoleonic War the British Government had 200,000 parts of muskets either partly finished or waiting repairs. Their muskets were made after the old system. Each one was built separately with its parts individually fitted together, so that whenever any part was injured, the musket had to be laid aside and sent back to the workshop for repairs.\n\nLong before that time, the idea of making standard guns had been hit upon in France. Thomas Jefferson, while Minister to France, in 1785, wrote of the French system which was then being developed by a mechanic named Le Blanc. He was building a musket in which the parts were of standard pattern, and which could be assembled by taking pieces haphazard as they came to hand and putting them together without special fitting. Thomas Jefferson called the attention of the American Government to this system and showed that it was possible to produce muskets cheaper by that method of manufacture. However, our Government at that time failed to avail itself of the opportunity of utilizing this system of manufacture.\n\nLater on, the idea was taken up in this country by Eli Whitney and by Simeon North. When Whitney attempted to introduce the system, he was laughed at by French and English ordnance officials, and even our own Government officials were skeptical, particularly when they found that it required[50] so much preparation in the way of machinery and designing of parts before a single musket was completed. It seemed like a waste of money to invest in so much preparation. But Whitney was soon able to silence all his critics by taking to Washington ten pieces of each part of a musket and then selecting at hazard from each pile of pieces the requisite parts and putting together ten muskets. It was not long before the foreign governments saw the importance of this method of manufacture. Great Britain later adopted it in the making of her own rifles and called the process the \u201cAmerican System.\u201d\n\nBut it was not only in the field of rifles that interchangeable manufacture made itself felt. The New England clock industry provides an interesting illustration. At first the clocks were made of wood, but early in the nineteenth century, a clock maker, Chauncey Jerome by name, designed a brass clock in which the parts were made on the interchangeable system. Instead of building each clock as a separate piece of work, clocks were turned out by the thousands, and at an extremely low price. Soon he had flooded this country with his clocks and began to look around for other markets. Machinery had been used by other clock makers in producing wooden clocks, and movements which had cost $50 each in 1840 had been reduced to $5. But Chauncey Jerome\u2019s clock was made of brass and by means of the interchangeable system of manufacture he could produce it for less than 50 cents. The clock was such a success in this country that Jerome decided to try it abroad. Consequently he made arrangements with an agent in England and shipped over a large consignment. The British Government[51] was astonished at the low price of the clock and was convinced that it had been undervalued. At that time, they had a simple and ingenious method of punishing a consigner who undervalued the goods he wished to introduce into the country. This consisted in promptly appropriating the property at the price given in the invoice. In due course of time, much to Jerome\u2019s astonishment, he received a letter from the British Government stating that his clocks had been confiscated, and with the letter came a check paying for them at the invoice price. Jerome was not in the least dejected by the rebuke; on the contrary, he was rather elated, for, as far as he could figure it out, he had a spot-cash buyer for his goods and no selling expenses. He did not mind at all letting the British Government have the clocks at the invoice price. So he decided to try again with a larger shipment. To his great delight this shipment met the same fate as the first, and in due course another good British check arrived. Thus encouraged, Jerome sent over a third and still larger shipment, but by that time Johnny Bull began to suspect that the Yankee clock maker was getting the best of the bargain and, finally convinced that clocks really could be produced with profit at the low invoice price, he permitted them to enter his country. With this striking example, the fame of the Yankee system of manufacture spread over the world.\n\nIn order to have two parts alike, they must be placed under a machine in exactly the same way. In other words, they must be set in \u201cjigs\u201d or frames which are fitted into the machine in such a way that the tools will approach the work from exactly the same angle or penetrate the work to exactly the[52] same depth in ten, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a million pieces, as the case may be. Making jigs and dies consumes a great deal of time in preparation work, but once the preparation stage has been passed, articles are produced with wonderful rapidity and very little waste of time. Formerly it was necessary to determine the location of each hole in a casting separately and spend precious time in adjusting the work to the proper position under the tool. If the hole was to be threaded, it had to pass through several separate operations.\n\nTHE TURRET LATHE\nAfter the slide rest invented by Maudsley, the next great improvement on the lathe was a turret head or a sort of turntable which carried a number of tools. The tools are arranged to come automatically into play one after the other. One tool, for instance, may cut a groove in the work, another finish the face of the work, another bore a hole in the piece and another tap the hole. In many cases, several of these operations are performed simultaneously. The head of the lathe is provided with a hollow spindle so that the work is automatically fed to the tools through this spindle, and as soon as one piece is finished, it is automatically cut off and the jaws of the clutch which holds the work, or stock as it is called, open automatically so that a new length may slide forward and be operated upon by the tools. The machine requires no attention once the tools have been set up to the proper angle, except that it must be kept supplied with bars of stock as they are consumed, and with a copious flow of lubricant on the tools. One operator can therefore take charge of a number of automatic[53] lathes. All he does is to feed them; they do the rest.\n\nThe modern drill has also gone through a great many developments in order to speed up the work that it performs. When a casting is to have forty or fifty holes drilled and tapped in it, instead of following the old method of drilling each hole separately, a lot of separate drilling spindles are used, each fitted with a drill, and these are brought simultaneously into play. As many as fifty or sixty holes may be drilled at a single operation, and after the holes have been drilled, the drilling spindles move to one side to make way for the taps, which thread such of the holes as are to receive screws. By first setting the spindles in the proper position and then using jigs to locate the work properly under them, the assurance is had that every one of the scores of holes drilled will be accurately spaced apart and the spacing in every casting will be identical.\n\nThe multiple tool system is also used in milling machines in which a number of milling cutters either of the face or the end type come into play simultaneously upon a piece of work set in a suitable jig, and cut the piece with absolute precision, so that all castings will have faces accurately spaced apart and cut to exactly the same level.\n\nIt is by such methods as these that we are able to produce such large quantities of machinery at remarkably low cost. One of the most notable examples of such work was the development of the Liberty engine during the World War. This engine did not differ in principle from others built in Europe or in this country, but its design was carefully adapted to permit of interchangeable manufacture. No careful finish was used except where[54] indispensable. Special jigs, tools, and fixtures were prepared. Ingenious wrinkles of American manufacture were introduced. All this consumed time, and great was the irritation of the general public. Under ordinary conditions, it would have taken years to have developed the Liberty engine to the manufacturing stage, but under the urgent stress of war, the whole work of design and preparation for manufacture was crowded into a few short months, and then Liberty engines began to be manufactured on a stupendous scale.\n\nCUTTING WITH RED-HOT TOOLS\nOne of the most remarkable advances in machine tools was due to the studies of Fred W. Taylor. He entered a large steel plant in 1880 and was immediately struck with the enormous waste of effort on the part of the men in the plant. There was at that time considerable dissatisfaction among the workmen, and when Taylor endeavored to speed up work he was faced by the incontrovertible argument that he had no idea how much work a certain machine ought to turn out. There was nothing for him to do but either back down or study machine tools and discover their maximum capacity. This led him to investigate the matter of cutting speeds. For years he spent all of his spare time studying this subject, timing machines and experimenting with different types of cutting tools. He estimated that in the twenty-six years of his investigation he converted 800,000 pounds of steel into chips. What he wished to discover was the best depth of cut, the best speed of cutting, and the best speed at which the tool should be fed into the work. He soon discovered that, contrary to prevailing opinion, the[55] round-nosed tool was better than the diamond-pointed tool, that the coarse slow-cutting speed was better than a fine cut at high speed. He discovered that the best method of lubricating the tools was to keep them bathed in a heavy stream of water, supersaturated with carbonate of soda, so as to prevent the metal from rusting. The best tool steel of that day was known as a self-hardening steel. Manufacturers of the cutting steels had warned Taylor that he must not use water on these tools. Taylor, however, was not satisfied to take the word of others, but proceeded to investigate the matter himself, and discovered that he could safely increase the cutting speed of his tools 33 per cent by the use of a heavy stream of water for lubricating purposes. This led Taylor and his associate, Maunsel White, to investigate the different kinds of tool steels, and eventually they evolved a chrome tungsten tool which could do from two to four times the work of other tools. Later vanadium was added to the alloy, further improving the tool.\n\nAt the Exposition in Paris, in 1900, foreign manufacturers were astonished to find enormous lathes operating at high speed with the cutting tools taking such heavy cuts and feeding so fast that the nose of the tool was actually heated to a dull red heat, and yet it kept its cutting edge perfectly. This was a revelation to tool makers abroad, and it led immediately to the adoption of American high-speed cutting tools.\n\nThe development of the automobile, which began to take on serious proportions at about that time, is responsible above all other machines for improvements in American machine tools, and for the extension of the American system of interchangeable[56] manufacture. When automobiles came to be made on the interchangeable system and in enormous quantities so that the cost was reduced to within the limits of the average man\u2019s pocketbook, they began to make mechanics of men who before that had never used a tool; and this new and widespread interest in machinery stimulated the production of better and more efficient tools. Hence the progress of machine tools in the past few years has been simply phenomenal.\n\n[57]\n\nCHAPTER IV\nCOUNTING SECONDS\n\nYOU CAN measure civilization by its timepieces. The higher the civilization of a community the more it appreciates the value of time and the more minutely does it measure the passage of time. The savage divides his day into but two periods: the period of light and that of darkness; the early Romans divided their day into eight watches, four watches of daylight and four of night, but the higher and more complex civilization became, the smaller became the subdivisions of time. People began to feel the need of carrying the time with them, and about 1500 A. D. watches came into use, but it was not until 1665 that watches began to be equipped with minute hands, and it was almost exactly a century later that they were equipped with a second hand. To-day time means so much to us that we will fight our way into a subway express, instead of riding more comfortably in a local train, merely for the sake of saving five minutes. The tiny second hands of our watches divide the day into eighty-six thousand four hundred parts, and in some operations we measure time intervals down to the thousandth part of a second. Only among the most highly civilized nations are timepieces carried by the common people.\n\nIt used to be that time was made for slaves, but now time has made slaves of us. Shift the hands of[58] the clock and the whole nation is forced to change its habits.\n\nTime-measuring mechanism is given early prominence in this book because clocks were among the earliest machines invented, and they furnish an example of the wonderful ingenuity of inventors before the dawn of the modern era of machinery. Naturally this chapter must be largely historical.\n\nThe first thought of measuring time came from the ancient astronomers and astrologers, who, in watching the motions of heavenly bodies, the sun by day and the moon by day and night, found it necessary to keep a record of these motions and sought about for some mechanical means of doing so. The studies of the old astrologers were closely associated with religion, and as a consequence the most advanced intellects were centered upon astronomical matters and incidentally upon horology. Fortunately the design and construction of mechanisms for measuring time were not considered beneath the dignity of the scientists of those early days. Mathematicians felt free to record their investigations in this branch of mechanics, and as a consequence of the early cooperation of science and mechanics in this field much real progress was made, and the development of timepieces was more rapid than that of any other machine.\n\nTELLING TIME WITH A LEAKY BUCKET\nThe ancient Egyptians early felt the need of a better clock than the sundial, because it operated only on cloudless days and was absolutely worthless to tell off the hours of darkness. Realizing that time is a measure of motion, they sought for some slowly moving body whose motion could be[59] used to measure time, and naturally they turned to water. The earliest form of clock consisted merely of a leaking bucket. Either the bucket was filled with water which was allowed to escape through a very tiny orifice, or else the heavily loaded bucket was placed in water and the water was allowed to leak into the bucket until it sank. The period it took for a bucket to run dry or for a bucket to fill and sink indicated a lapse of an hour or some other standard of time.\n\nThe idea of subdividing this period was a later development. As the water leaked out of a bucket, the water level descended, but unfortunately not at a uniform rate. The weight of water in a full bucket made the drops come faster than when the bucket was nearly empty. Consequently the time graduations on the side of the bucket had to be set farther apart at the top of the bucket than at the bottom. Various ingenious schemes were devised for maintaining a uniform discharge. In one type of water clock or clepsydra a conical bucket was used so that there would be a constant relation between the head of water and the volume in the bucket and the time graduations could be spaced uniformly.\n\nTHE REMARKABLE WATER CLOCK OF CTESIBIUS\nThe most remarkable clepsydr\u00e6 were those invented by an old Alexandrian mathematician, Ctesibius, who lived about 250 years before Christ. Ctesibius introduced the siphon principle into his clocks, and also employed gear wheels and even a cord and pulley. Furthermore, he was the first man to employ jeweled bearings in a timepiece. The use of jewels in timepieces was reinvented in 1704 A. D.[60] However, Ctesibius used his jewels in a very different way from that in which they are used now, as will be described below.\n\n[61]\n\n\nFIG. 25.\u2014THE JEWELED WATER CLOCK BUILT BY CTESIBIUS ABOUT 250 B. C.\n\nFigure 25 illustrates the most interesting clock he built and it was arranged to run year in and year out. The clock had a cylindrical face mounted on a hollow pedestal in which the mechanism was concealed. The column was divided off into twenty-four hours and a pointer that rose vertically marked off the lapse of time. But here he was faced with a serious complication. Hours in those days varied with the time of the year. A day from sunrise to sunset consisted of twelve hours. In summer, when the days were long, the hours were long, and in the short days of winter the hours were correspondingly shortened. To be sure, the variations in the length of the day are not so great in Egypt as they are in our latitude, because it is nearer to the equator; nevertheless there is a difference which the precise old mathematician had to take into account. In order to provide for variations in the hours, Ctesibius ran the lines spirally around the column and arranged his cylindrical clockface to turn slightly each day, so that in the winter months the clock hand or pointer moved over that part of the face where the daylight hour lines were closer together and the hours of night were farther apart, while in summer, the reverse would obtain. At the bottom of the column were two little cherubs. The cherub on the left was a sad little fellow who was constantly weeping. Tears trickled from his eyes and dropped into a basin. The tears passed into the hollow pedestal of the clock and gradually filled a cylinder formed in the base of the clock. A piston in this cylinder supported the other cherub. As the water gradually filled the cylinder this cherub was slowly raised and a wand he held in his hand pointed off the hours on the clockface. When the twenty-fourth hour was reached, a siphon came into play, which suddenly emptied the cylinder,[62] permitting the pointer to drop. The siphon discharged its water into a small water wheel, which, by means of the system of gears, turned the column slightly to bring the hour lines in proper positions for measuring the time intervals of the next day. The column made one complete turn in 365 days. The jeweled bearings, referred to above, were placed in the eyes of the weeping boy, so that the holes that pierced them would not be enlarged by the constant wear of the water and thereby increase the rate of flow.\n\nTIMING ANCIENT ORATORS\nWe have dwelt at considerable length upon this old clock of the pre-Christian era to show the ingenuity of inventors of that day, and also the careful study that was made of time by ancient mathematicians and astronomers. Of course water clocks were used before the time of Ctesibius. In fact, we read of them in the comedies of Aristophanes, written 400 B. C. Water clocks were used to limit the long speeches of orators at court, and in one place we find Demosthenes accusing a man of \u201ctalking in my water,\u201d while at another time, when he was interrupted, he called to the officer to stop the water, showing that he valued every moment of time allotted to him for his speech.\n\nIn 807 Charlemagne was presented with a clock by the King of Persia. This consisted of an elaborate mechanism in which were all manner of wheels, and the clock would actually strike the hours. The driving power, however, was water.\n\nBut there were serious disadvantages in the use of water for the measurement of time. No great accuracy was ever obtainable with it, owing to the[63] fact that its volume varied considerably with the temperature, and also with the dryness or moisture in the surrounding atmosphere. The idea of using a weight instead of water is claimed to have originated as far back as 990 A. D. The next important advance in the motive power of clocks was in 1500, when Peter Hele of Nuremberg invented the mainspring.\n\nThat was long before the pendulum made its appearance. The clock mechanism was slowed down and kept under control by what was known as a balance lever. (See Figure 26.) This was a horizontal lever mounted to oscillate in a horizontal plane. The lever was fitted with sliding weights, so that it could be carefully adjusted. The last wheel of the train of gears was provided with escapement teeth, somewhat similar to those used on our clocks and watches, but which would alternately move the lever this way and that. The inertia of the lever with the heavy weights on it was sufficient to prevent the mechanism from racing, and by this means, the motion was governed and slowed down, so that it measured time with a fair degree of accuracy.\n\nDISCOVERY OF THE PENDULUM\n[64]\n\n\nFIG. 26.\u2014THE BALANCE LEVER, PREDECESSOR OF THE PENDULUM\n\nThe pendulum had an interesting origin. Galileo, while a student in Pisa in 1581, was attending a service in the cathedral one day when his attention was drawn to the swinging of a large hanging lamp. One of the attendants had drawn the lamp toward him, so that he could reach it more readily to light it. When he let go the lamp began to swing slowly back and forth, and the observant young student noticed that although the oscillations gradually slowed down the period of oscillation was constant. He had no watch with which to measure the length of the period, but being a medical student he knew that he had a fair timepiece in his own heartbeats, and so by counting his pulse he proved that it took the lamp just as long to complete each oscillation when it swept through a long arc as when it died down to but a few inches. He made note of this peculiar action and began experimenting with pendulums of different lengths. Then it occurred to him that if he could time the pendulum with his pulse he could time his pulse with a pendulum. So he devised a pendulum whose length could be adjusted until its oscillation would coincide with the throb of a patient\u2019s pulse, and then the length of the pendulum would give him the rate of the pulse beat. The invention was seized upon by the medical profession of that day, and the pulsilogia, as it was called, became an indispensable instrument for physicians.\n\n\nBUCKET OF A GIANT DREDGE WITH ITS JAWS SPREAD WIDE OPEN\n\n\nGOLD DREDGER EATING ITS WAY THROUGH RIVER SANDS\n\n\nA SUCTION DREDGE EXCAVATING A CHANNEL AND BUILDING NEW LAND\n\n[65]\n\nThe idea of using the pendulum to control the action of the clock also occurred to Galileo, and in later years, after he had lost his sight, he passed the idea down to his son, Vincent. However, it is generally conceded that the credit for introducing the pendulum and doing away with the balance lever belongs to Christian Huygens, the Dutch mathematician, whose first pendulum clock dates back to 1659.\n\nAbout the same time Dr. Robert Hooke invented the balance spring which made it unnecessary to use the pendulum in portable timepieces. Prior to that watches were fitted with balance levers and they gave a great deal of trouble, because the time varied with the position in which they were carried. But the balance wheel overcame all these difficulties and made it possible for a person to carry an accurate timepiece in his vest pocket, although the early watches were very bulky mechanisms.\n\nTHE FIRST SHIP\u2019S CHRONOMETER\nThe importance of having accurate timepieces aboard ship was felt as far back as the time of Columbus. When ships began to go out beyond the sight of land, it was highly important that they be equipped with some means of locating their position at sea. By noting the elevation of the sun at noon with a sextant it was possible to determine the latitude of the ship, but there was no means of determining its longitude, except by dead reckoning, that is, using a log to measure the speed of a ship, and[66] estimating its position by calculating the number of miles it had traveled since leaving port. If ships could be provided with an accurate timepiece which would keep the same time as that of some fixed observatory, it would be possible definitely to locate the position of the ship east or west by noting how fast or slow the sun was at noon on the particular day on which the observation was taken. This use of the chronometer is common in these days, but up to 150 years ago there was no timepiece sufficiently accurate to permit a navigator to tell with any certainty just where he was.\n\nIt was John Harrison, the son of a Yorkshire carpenter, who was the first to build a chronometer worthy of the name. A prize of 10,000 pounds was offered by the British Parliament for anyone who could invent and sell a chronometer which would enable a ship to take a voyage from England to any of the West Indian islands and back and keep track of the longitude within one degree. If this could be defined within two-thirds of a degree, the prize would be 15,000 pounds. Harrison made a bid for this prize, and after years of effort and patient labor, he succeeded in being granted a trial. His son, William, was sent on a ship to Jamaica with the now celebrated chronometer, which was mounted on a large cushion. The instrument was constantly attended by the young man, its position being adjusted from time to time to suit the \u201clie\u201d of the ship. When the ship was eighteen days out, the vessel was estimated by dead reckoning to be 13\u00b0 50\u2032 west of Portsmouth, but the chronometer indicated the position as 15\u00b0 19\u2032. The timepiece was immediately condemned as worthless, but William Harrison had not lost faith in the instrument, and insisted that if[67] the ship continued on the same course, a certain island, if properly marked on the chart, would be seen the following day. True to the prediction, the next morning at seven o\u2019clock the island appeared. By means of his chronometer William Harrison was able to predict the appearance of the other islands, and at the end of the voyage, which occupied sixty-one days, the chronometer was only nine seconds slow. When he returned to Portsmouth, after an absence of five months, the error of the chronometer was only one minute and five seconds, giving an error in distance of only eighteen miles, whereas thirty miles was the margin of error allowed by the prize conditions. Such accuracy seemed so incredible that the chronometer had to be tested on a second voyage, during which it was kept under lock and key and when William Harrison had to wind the instrument he was obliged to do so in the presence of two witnesses, lest he move the hand of the chronometer surreptitiously. At the end of the second voyage there was no further doubt that Harrison was fully entitled to the prize. Chronometers soon came to be used extensively, until now they are one of the most perfect of machines made by man, and operate with an accuracy that is almost incredible. Usually a ship is provided with several chronometers, so that one may be used as a check upon another. They are mounted in ball sockets and gimbal joints, so that they are not affected by the roll of the ship, but always lie in a horizontal position.\n\nMARVELOUS PRECISION OF MODERN WATCHES\nWhile we may well marvel at the precision of the chronometer, it is equally marvelous, if not more so, that we may equip ourselves for a few dollars with[68] a timepiece which is so wonderfully accurate as to vary little more than a second per day. If one took the pains to regulate his watch carefully, any of the better makes could be adjusted to such accuracy.\n\nThere is nothing very mysterious about the mechanism of a watch. It consists merely of a train of gears which slow down the motions of the mainspring to a convenient speed; and these gears moreover keep the proper relation between the hour and minute and second hands. But when we reflect that a small watch possesses a tiny second hand which travels something like ten miles in a year, and that if carefully regulated it will not vary from that of another watch in the whole journey by more than six or eight inches at the most, we certainly have a reason to marvel. There are 86,400 seconds in a day, and a watch is usually arranged to make five beats per second or 432,000 per day. The interval between beats must be adjusted with such minuteness that one beat must not differ from another by 1/86000 part of a second, else the watch will register more than a second fast or slow at the end of a day. And yet watches capable of such precision are being turned out daily by the thousands. Of course, such perfection would be absolutely impossible without the use of extremely accurate machine tools. It would have been impossible as long as we had to depend upon a watchmaker to make a watch by hand.\n\nTHE PACEMAKER OF A WATCH\nIf we look at the works of a clock the most conspicuous feature is the rapidly oscillating balance wheel which, by the way, is the most important part of the watch, for it governs the release of the power stored up in the spring.\n\n[69]\n\nIt controls the escapement which brings the whole mechanism of the clock to a standstill five times each second\u2014in fact it is the pacemaker of the watch, for it gives the watch a step-by-step movement and fixes the rate at which the steps are taken.\n\n\nFIG. 27.\u2014ESCAPEMENT OF A WATCH\n\nThe last wheel of the watch train is what is known as an escape wheel. It is formed with teeth of an odd shape, such as shown at A in Figure 27. These teeth are engaged by a pair of pallets B and C, carried by a three-armed lever D. The pallets are usually bits of sapphire or similar hard stone to prevent wear. The third of the lever is slotted at its extremity to engage a sapphire pin E, carried by a disk F, which is mounted on the staff of the balance wheel. The escape wheel A revolves in the direction of the arrow, being impelled by the mainspring acting through the train of gears. One of the teeth of this wheel engages the pallet B, causing the lever D to swing on its axis and push the[70] sapphire pin E toward the left, thereby giving the disk F an impulse in the same direction. Here a delicate coil spring, known as the hairspring, comes into play. Without the hairspring the parts would stand still, the escape wheel being blocked by the pallet B. The hairspring is attached at one end to the shaft or staff of the disk F and the other to the frame of the watch. It tries to hold the disk F in a fixed position, but is disturbed by the action of the escape wheel and is constantly oscillating the disk in its effort to bring it back to its normal position. When the disk swings over to the left the pallet B is clear of the teeth of the escape wheel. This releases the escape wheel and it springs forward in the direction of the arrow, but before it can move through an interval of one tooth it is arrested by the second pallet C, which has been projected into its path by the swing of the lever D. The lever swings back until the pallet C clears the escape wheel and the pallet B engages the next tooth. And so the action continues, the lever swinging back and forth and at each complete oscillation releasing one tooth of the escape wheel.\n\nThe hairspring takes up the shock of this intermittent motion and a balance wheel carried by the staff to which F is fastened steadies the oscillatory motion of the lever D. A watch is full of microscopic parts. In a small timepiece there are machine-made screws so small that without the aid of a magnifying glass one cannot see the screw threads cut upon them. But the most marvelous part of the whole watch is the delicate hairspring and the means of adjusting its tension and compensating for its expansion and contraction with changes of temperature.\n\n[71]\n\nINANIMATE MATTER IN CONTINUAL MOTION\nWhen working with minute intervals of time many factors must be considered which are not even thought of in machines of grosser proportions. It never occurs to the man in the street that not only the animate world but the inanimate as well is in ceaseless and variable motion. If our eyes were capable of taking in minute microscopic details, we should see that everything is expanding or contracting, swelling or shriveling, twisting and warping in response to the atmospheric changes. Our steel bridges and skyscrapers are in constant motion; solid concrete dams must be provided with expansion joints; the Washington Monument goes through a diurnal gyration in response to the sun\u2019s rays. Of course all this motion is almost immeasurably small. A bar of steel a mile long will expand \u2156 of an inch for every increase of a degree Fahrenheit in temperature. The expansion of a hairspring, which may be nine or ten inches long, is infinitesimally small and yet this must be considered by the watchmaker. We must remember that the escapement mechanism divides the day into 432,000 parts, each of which contains some minute error, for absolute perfection is impossible, and if we add up all these 432,000 errors they must not foot up to more than a second per day. If the hairspring expands ever so slightly its power is weakened, but this loss of power is compensated by an ingenious form of balance wheel. The rim is in two parts, half of it being attached to one spoke of the wheel and the other half to the other, as shown in Figure 28. Each half rim is formed of two strips of metal, an inner strip of steel, and an outer strip of brass[72] fused together. Brass expands and contracts almost twice as much as steel, and hence when there is a rise of temperature the rim sections tend to curl in, bringing their center of gravity nearer the center of the wheel and making less of a load for the weakened hairspring to move, while on the other hand, when the spring is contracted by cold, the rims spread out slightly, giving it a greater load to oscillate. The weight of the balance wheel is thus automatically adjusted against variations in power of the spring.\n\n\nFIG. 28.\u2014THE SELF-CORRECTING BALANCE WHEEL OF A WATCH\n\nAside from this automatic variable adjustment, the balance wheel must have a primary permanent adjustment. The rim of the wheel is loaded by means of small screws. Screws placed near the free ends of the rim sections will have a greater inward or outward play as the rim contracts and expands, and by their locations in different positions on the rims the balance wheel may be adjusted with great accuracy to compensate for temperature variation in the hairspring.\n\n[73]\n\nTHE PENDULUM ESCAPEMENT\n\nFIG. 29.\u2014PENDULUM ESCAPEMENT\n\nIn the case of clocks such delicacy of adjustment is hardly necessary. Pendulum clocks, if they are to run accurately, must have their pendulums automatically adjustable for variations in temperature, because the longer the pendulum the more slowly it oscillates. Many years ago a grid type of pendulum was invented in which various alloys were used, which reacted one against the other and preserved the center of gravity always at the same distance from the center of oscillation. The action of a pendulum movement is similar to that of a balance-wheel movement described above. The pendulum operates a pallet lever similar to that shown in Figure 29. The teeth of an escape wheel, which are commonly somewhat different from those of the watch movement, strike the pallets of the pallet lever, and the escape wheel is intermittently stopped and permitted to proceed. The pressure of the escapement[74] teeth against the pallets is just enough to keep the pendulum swinging and the speed of the clock is regulated by lengthening or shortening the pendulum.\n\nWe have added little to clock or watch movements in recent years. About the only conspicuous modern invention is the torsion pendulum. The pendulum in this case is a heavy horizontal disk suspended by a wire, and the disk rotates first in one direction and then in the other, twisting and untwisting the wire. The advantage of this pendulum is that the oscillations are very slow, and hence it is possible to keep the clock going for a year at a single winding.\n\nThe electric regulation of clocks is another important improvement. A clock need not be a very perfect timepiece, but if provided with an electric regulator its hands are brought up to the correct time every hour in response to an impulse sent from an accurate master clock which in turn has its time corrected daily from the National Observatory in Washington.\n\n[75]\n\nCHAPTER V\nPUTTING RIVERS TO WORK\n\nFLOWING water exerts a strange fascination upon mankind, even to the present day. Tourists travel hundreds of miles to view the glorious spectacle of a riotous tumbling cataract. Is it strange, then, that in the olden times, when the world was peopled with gods and genii and strange spirits, the ancients looked upon ceaselessly flowing rivers as the symbol of life? It was most natural for them to covet the endless power of a river and eventually, despite their superstitions, to try to utilize some of its energy.\n\nIt may be that sailboats antedate the first water wheel, but it seems much more probable that flowing water was the first inanimate power harnessed by man. Windmills were certainly a later development. They possessed the advantage that they could be located anywhere while the water mill had of necessity to be built along the bank of a stream. However, the power of the wind is so unreliable and fluctuates so widely that it was little used, except in flat countries, where there was little if any available water power.\n\nWater power predominated until the steam engine was introduced, when it had to give way to an even more reliable power and one which could be located at any place to which fuel could be transported. Now, however, we are going back to our first power,[76] seeking it out in the most inaccessible mountainous regions, because we have discovered the means of taking the power it yields and transmitting it hundreds of miles, over hills and plains to the point where we can put it to useful service. Hydroelectric power has very aptly been termed \u201cwhite coal.\u201d\n\nThe first prime motor was the current wheel, that is, a wheel fitted with paddles, which was journaled over a stream with the paddles projecting into the water. This was a very inefficient machine; it converted very little of the energy of a stream into useful mechanical power. The idea of damming the stream and letting the waters flow over the dam through a raceway upon a water wheel was a much later development.\n\nWATER WHEELS\nThree types of water wheel which were in universal use before the advent of the steam engine were the undershot wheel, the overshot wheel, and the breast wheel (Figure 30). In the undershot wheel the water stored back of a dam is let out near the bottom of the dam and strikes the under side of the wheel, so that the top of the wheel turns toward the dam. In the overshot wheel, the water flows over the wheel striking the paddles or buckets on top and on the forward side, so that the wheel turns forward. In the breast wheel, the water strikes the paddles half way up the wheel on the rear side and drives the wheel in the same direction as that of the undershot wheel.\n\nWhen we speak of water power we are apt to think of the water as actually furnishing the energy. As a matter of fact, it is not water but gravity that drives the wheel, the water being merely the medium[77] that gravity acts upon. By having the water drop from a great height, its velocity is greatly increased and the power it imparts to the wheel is much higher. In mountainous regions it is easy to obtain a high head of water and thus generate a great deal of power from a relatively small stream. However, the ancient type of wheel with its paddles or buckets has now practically passed out of existence, being superseded by the Pelton wheel for high heads and the turbine for low heads of water.\n\n\nFIG. 30.\u2014UNDERSHOT, OVERSHOT, AND BREAST WHEELS\n\nINVENTION OF THE PELTON WHEEL\n[78]\n\n\nFIG. 31.\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A PAIR OF PELTON WHEEL BUCKETS SHOWING HOW THE WATER JET IS DIVIDED AND FOLLOWS THE CONTOUR OF THE BUCKETS\n\nIn California, a number of years ago, they made use of what was known as the hurdy-gurdy wheel. This consisted of an ordinary wheel with bucket-shaped paddles against which was directed a stream of water at high velocity through a nozzle. There was a carpenter, named L. A. Pelton, who used to make a business of building and repairing such wheels and the flumes that carried the water to them. Although uneducated, he was possessed of considerable native ingenuity and was a very observant man. One day, when he was called in to repair a wheel, he noticed that one of the buckets which had been misplaced received the water from the nozzle without any splashing. The water struck the edge of the bucket with practically no shock, whereas the other buckets produced a great deal of splashing. Pelton had enough knowledge of the principles of mechanics to realize that a splash means a waste of energy, and that here was a bucket which, although out of plumb and apparently defective, was really more efficient than any of the others in the wheel. It occurred to him then that instead of having the jet of water strike the middle of the buckets it ought to strike the edge, so that all its power would be absorbed without any wasteful splashing. He might have displaced the jet laterally so as to accomplish this result, but he realized that that would have produced a considerable side thrust on the wheel, which, of course, would have been objectionable, and so he hit upon the plan of using double buckets and letting the stream of water strike the pair of buckets along their dividing line.[79] (See Figure 31.) This would split the stream in two and let each half strike the slanting face of the bucket, and follow the surface around in the same way that it did on the single misplaced bucket, but the reaction or side thrust on one bucket would be counteracted by that on the other. This idea proved successful and out of it has grown the Pelton wheel which is now universally used in all power plants employing high heads of water.\n\nA 4,000-FOOT HEAD OF WATER\nA notable illustration of such a plant is the great installation at Big Creek, Cal. Big Creek, despite its name, used to be a small stream flowing down the mountains into a canyon. One would hardly suppose that it was capable of yielding much power, but it had its source high up in the Sierras and was fed mainly by melting snows. In the springtime, it swelled to a good-sized torrent. By building three dams near the top of the mountain, a lake was formed in which the water of the melting snow was impounded, so that a steady stream of water could be supplied the year round for power purposes. But even so, the stream hardly amounts to very much if we consider only the quantity of water that passes through it. The particular advantage of this installation is the fact that in a distance of six miles from the dam the creek falls 4,000 feet.\n\nAn inhabitant of the Eastern States who is unused to mountain heights may gain some conception of the meaning of this elevation by gazing up to the pinnacle of the Woolworth Tower, which rises 795 feet above street level, then mentally multiplying its altitude by five. Evidently even a small stream of water dropping from such an elevation would develop[80] an enormous amount of power. In fact, it was considered inexpedient to use the entire fall at a single drop and so it was divided into two stages. The water is carried through a tunnel three-quarters of a mile long and then through a flow pipe along the face of the mountain to a point where it may drop 2,000 feet to the first power plant. After passing through this plant the water is discharged into the creek and is then diverted into a second tunnel four miles long and a series of steel conduits to a point from which it may drop 2,000 feet more to the second power plant. In each power house there are two electric generators, each fitted with a pair of Pelton wheels. These wheels are a little less than eight feet in diameter and each one develops 23,000 horsepower.\n\nThe water is directed into the buckets of the Pelton wheel in a stream six inches in diameter, and it issues from the nozzle with a velocity of 300 feet per second or about 210 miles per hour. A jet of water is almost like a solid bar of wood. In fact, it is impossible to chop through it with an ax. The water would swing the ax out of one\u2019s hand before it got part way through the jet. Traveling at such a high speed the friction is so great that it would tear the skin off one\u2019s hands, if it did not actually tear the hand off the arm, and yet it strikes the buckets of the wheels with no shock at all, for the first part of the bucket it touches is nearly parallel to the jet, and as the water sweeps around the curved face of the bucket it loses practically all of its pressure and velocity and falls into the tail race. The electric power generated by the two plants is stepped up to 150,000 volts and sent out over transmission lines to points of service. The street cars[81] of Los Angeles are connected by a 240-mile electric harness to the hydraulic horses of Big Creek.\n\nPowerful as this stream is, a still higher head is used in Switzerland, at Lake Fully, where there is a drop of over a mile in a distance of 2.8 miles. The water is carried by a short tunnel through the mountain, and then makes a drop of over 5,000 feet to the power plant, where it strikes the Pelton wheels at a velocity of 400 miles per hour, or about seven times the speed of a fast express train.\n\nHARNESSING THE MISSISSIPPI\nIn contrast to such high heads, we have the low-head power plants which are employed where a large volume of water is available. The most notable installation of this type, and the largest in the world, is that at Keokuk, Iowa, where a dam has been thrown across the Mississippi River. For many years it was thought impossible to make any use of the vast volume of water that flows through this great river. But above Keokuk there used to be a rapid extending back about twelve miles. By building a dam across the river just below the rapid it was possible to obtain a working head of about thirty-two feet, and with the enormous volume of water available this provided sufficient energy to make the development worth while. In marked contrast to the installation at Big Creek, it is volume rather than velocity that is employed, and hence turbines rather than Pelton wheels are used. More water goes through a single turbine than is used in the whole of the city of New York with all its elaborate aqueduct system. Enormous turbines are used, fifteen feet in diameter, and when the installation is complete there will be thirty units,[82] each yielding 10,000 horsepower, or a total of 300,000 horsepower. A turbine, it may be explained, differs from the ordinary water wheel in the fact that the water runs through the wheel instead of around it (Figure 32). The water may enter at the center and then flow out at the periphery, or it may enter at the periphery and then be discharged from the center of the wheel, or it may run axially through the wheel. In a Pelton wheel there is a single jet which strikes but one pair of buckets at a time, but in a turbine there are many jets distributed all around the circumference of the wheel. The water is divided into a series of jets by being forced through a stationary set of curved vanes. The blades of the rotor or revolving part of the turbine are oppositely curved. If the rotor were immovable the jets would have to change their direction in passing through the rotor, but as the rotor is free to turn, the jets react against these blades and set the wheel to revolving. The turbine may be designed to run either on a horizontal axis or on a vertical one.\n\n\nFIG. 32.\u2014TURBINE WHEELS; INFLOW TYPE SHOWN ON THE LEFT AND OUTFLOW TYPE ON THE RIGHT\n\nThe turbines used at the Keokuk plant are of the inflow type. The rotor is mounted on a vertical shaft in a scroll-shaped concrete chamber, something like[83] a snail shell. Water pouring into this chamber is thus given a swirling motion in the direction of rotation of the wheel. As it flows into the wheel it passes first through a ring of fixed vanes, which divide it into the jets.\n\nThe highest velocity of a wheel is naturally at the periphery and the advantage of an inflowing turbine such as this is that the water is traveling at its highest velocity when it strikes the periphery of the rotor. As it loses its velocity it flows in toward the slower-moving portions of the rotor. Finally it reaches the center, after giving up practically all its energy, and falls into the tail pool through a draft tube at the center of the rotor.\n\nThe scroll chambers at Keokuk are thirty-nine feet in diameter and the draft tubes are eighteen feet in diameter. Water enters the scroll chambers with a velocity of fourteen feet per second and comes out of the draft tubes into the tail pool with its velocity cut down to but four feet per second. Compare this with the velocity of the water jets at Big Creek!\n\nThe current generated at Keokuk goes to St. Louis and surrounding towns and serves a population of 1,120,000.\n\nNow that we have learned how to transmit electrical power without serious loss over enormous distances, it is only a question of time before all the water power in the world is harnessed and put to the service of man. The power costs nothing after once the plant has been built; the only expense is that of maintaining the machinery and keeping it in repair. It is estimated that there is some 200,000,000 horsepower available in this country, but this includes all flowing water, much of which it[84] would be impracticable, if not almost impossible, to utilize. However, there is about 60,000,000 horsepower commercially available, according to the figures of the U. S. Geological Survey, of which we have developed so far only 6,000,000 horsepower.\n\nThe ancients used flowing streams not so much for power purposes as to lift water to a higher level so that it would flow into their irrigating ditches. Nowadays, electricity, steam, or air is used for elevating water, but we have a very ingenious machine which makes the stream lift a part of itself. This machine is very different in principle from the old Egyptian noria. It depends upon the kinetic energy of water in motion. You cannot push a nail into a piece of wood with a hammer but you can easily drive it in by striking it with the hammer. As the hammer is swung it acquires what we term kinetic energy or energy of motion.\n\nSETTING KITCHEN FAUCETS TO WORK\nIt is not generally realized that water in motion also acquires kinetic energy. Whenever a faucet is turned off very quickly, there is a hammering sound which is due to the fact that the moving water in the water pipe is brought to an abrupt stop. This puts a severe strain on the piping. A great deal of trouble was experienced from this source in the early days of plumbing. At a hospital in Bristol, England, there was a lead pipe leading from a cistern in one of the upper stories to the kitchen. Every time the faucets were turned off abruptly the momentum of the water caused the lead pipe to expand, and every now and then the pipe was burst. In order to relieve the situation, a plumber connected a pipe to the faucet and carried it up the side[85] of the building to the level of the cistern. His idea was that whenever the water was turned off suddenly it would have a vent leading up to the level of the water reservoir. Much to his surprise, the water issued from the pipe in a jet of considerable height. To prevent the escape of the water, he extended the pipe considerably, and still a jet of water would issue from it. Eventually the relief pipe was carried up twice the height of the cistern and even then the water would squirt out occasionally when the faucets in the kitchen were turned off very suddenly. Then the idea was conceived of placing a reservoir on one of the upper floors of the hospital and letting the jet of water fill this reservoir. Every time the faucet was operated in the kitchen a certain amount of water flowed into the new cistern, and in this way it was kept supplied with enough water to furnish that which was required for the upper floors of the hospital.\n\n\nFIG. 33.\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A WATER RAM\n\nIt is on this principle that the hydraulic ram operates. Water from a stream is made to flow down a pipe, and as it gains velocity a check valve suddenly[86] stops the flow which produces enough pressure to force open a valve in an air chamber and let some of the water enter the chamber. As soon as the pressure is relieved the check valve opens and the valve into the chamber closes automatically until a moment later the stream of water has gained sufficient velocity to repeat the performance. Thus an intermittent jet of water is forced into the air chamber and thence through a pipe to a reservoir. The height to which the water will rise depends entirely upon the velocity of the water flowing through the system. The air chamber is necessary to cushion the action of the hydraulic ram and provide a fairly steady pressure upon the water that flows up through the vent pipe. The check valve is entirely automatic. It is held open against the pressure of the water by a spring or a weight, but when the water is in motion is dragged shut, only to spring open again when the pressure is reduced by the escape of the water into the air chamber.\n\n\nFIG. 34.\u2014THE GYRATING WATER METER\n\n[87]\n\nThere is a very ingenious water-driven motor which is employed merely to record the amount of water flowing through it. This is the Thomson water meter which is illustrated in Figure 34. It consists of a circular chamber with inwardly dished or conical top and bottom walls. In the chamber is a flat disk with a ball and socket bearing. At one side there is a vertical diaphragm in the chamber which passes through a slot in the disk. This prevents the disk from revolving, but it is free to oscillate. It has a motion similar to the gyrations of a top when it is beginning to lose speed and die down, except that the disk does not revolve. When the disk is in contact with the bottom wall of the chamber on one side it contacts with the top wall on the other so that the chamber is virtually divided into two compartments by the disk, but by gyrating the disk these compartments are made to revolve. Water enters at one side and discharges at the other side of the vertical diaphragm. Now, if the disk is in the position shown in Figure 34, the water, on entering, bears upon the upper face of the inclined disk and wedges its way between the disk and the upper wall of the chamber, making the disk oscillate on its ball center. As the edge of the disk rises across the face of inlet port the water entering the chamber bears against the under side of the disk, continuing the gyratory motion. The water cut off on the upper side of the disk is carried around to the outlet and discharges, while a fresh supply flows in on the other side of the vertical partition and at the next half turn the water in the lower compartment discharges at the outlet side of the partition, while the compartment is filling on the other side of the partition. A measured amount of water flows through[88] the chamber at each gyratory oscillation of the disk. A train of gearing is driven by the gyrating disk which operates a set of dial pointers and a measure of the amount of water passing through the meter is indicated.\n\nDIGGING WITH WATER JETS\nWe have referred to the enormous velocity of the jets used to drive Pelton wheels. Where high heads of water are obtainable water jets are used very effectively for excavating purposes, particularly in mining plants for washing down gold-bearing gravel banks. If water is not found near such banks expensive canals, flumes, and pipe lines are constructed and even tunnels are bored to bring the water to the point where it can be utilized. Some of the giant nozzles spout streams from 2 to 8 inches in diameter with a pressure of from 50 to 200 pounds per square inch. The powerful streams tear into the gravel banks, washing them away into sluices in which riffle boxes are placed to catch the precious metal. The back pressure of these nozzles is very heavy and the larger ones have to be provided with strong anchorages. Water in motion resists any change of direction and long levers have to be provided to permit the miners to guide the nozzles.\n\nThe hydraulic jet is also used for general excavating wherever water power is available. Sometimes it is employed under water when clearing a channel to level down piles of stones that are too large to be picked up by a suction dredge. Hollow iron piles are driven into a sandy bottom by means of hydraulic jets. No hammer is needed. Water is pumped into the pile and on issuing from the bottom[89] of the pile it carries sand with it, making a hole into which the pile sinks. Wooden piles are driven in the same way by loosely attaching a water pipe to them so that the pipe may be withdrawn when the pile has been driven far enough. The pile is grooved at the lower end so that the pipe outlet may be centered at the bottom of the pile.\n\nCOMPRESSING AIR WITH WATER\n\nFIG. 35.\u2014HOW THE VENA CONTRACTA RAISES WATER\n\nA very ingenious apparatus for compressing air was invented in the earliest years of the iron age to furnish a continuous blast of air for the Catalan forges. This compressor, known as a \u201ctrompe,\u201d can hardly be termed a machine because it contains no moving parts except water, which is the motive power, and the air which it traps and compresses. To understand its operation we must look into a peculiar property of water flowing out of a reservoir into a pipe or nozzle. There is a converging motion that tends to contract the jet of water just after it leaves the pipe. This is known as the vena[90] contracta. It produces a partial vacuum in the pipe. If air ports are opened into the pipe at this point, air will be sucked in to fill the vacuum and will be carried out of the pipe by the friction of the water. In Figure 35 a pipe is shown running from the vena contracta to a water tank below. The rise of water in this pipe indicates the degree of vacuum produced by the jet.\n\n\nFIG. 36.\u2014THE \u201cTROMPE\u201d BY WHICH COMPRESSED AIR WAS FURNISHED FOR CATALAN FORGES\n\nThis principle is used in the hydraulic-air compressor or \u201ctrompe\u201d as it is called. Water flows out of one reservoir through a pipe into another reservoir lower down. (See Figure 36.) Air enters[91] the pipe through ports at the point where the vein of water contracts and is carried down into the second reservoir. This reservoir is sealed so that the air is trapped in it. The water passes out through a pipe which is carried high enough to keep a certain pressure of air in the reservoir and prevent it from blowing out.\n\n\nFIG. 37.\u2014DIAGRAMMATIC SECTION OF A LARGE HYDRAULIC AIR COMPRESSOR IN MICHIGAN\n\nThere is a compressor of this type, constructed on an enormous scale, in the northern part of Michigan. A sketch of the compressor is given in Figure 37. The air reservoir in this case is a huge underground rock-walled chamber nearly 350 feet below the surface, 8 feet wide, 26 feet high, and about 280 feet long. There are three intake pipes, 5 feet in diameter, each filled with an annular funnel-shaped head, which sucks air into the water and carries it down into the chamber. At the bottom of each intake pipe there is a concrete block with a conical top projecting up into the pipe. The column of water flowing[92] down the pipe is spread out into an annular stream by the conical block and the bubbles of air escape into the chamber. The water outlet of the chamber is an inclined shaft which leads up about 270 feet to the surface of the ground where it discharges into the tail race. The water is forced up this inclined shaft by the pressure of the air trapped in the chamber. The mouth of the shaft is, of course, below the level of the water in the chamber so that there is no chance for the air to escape unless the pressure becomes excessively high, when it will force the water level below the mouth of the shaft and blow out. The discharge sometimes forms a geyser 700 feet high. The air will continue to blow until the pressure is reduced enough for the water level to rise and cut off access of the air to the mouth of the shaft. Under normal conditions there is a fall of 343 feet from the water level at the top of the intake pipe to the water level in the chamber, and a vertical rise of 271 feet from the water level in the chamber to the tail-water level. The difference, or 72 feet, represents the working head. With all three intakes operating, a total of 5,000 horsepower is developed. Each intake delivers 11,930 cubic feet of air per minute at a pressure of 128 pounds. Air enters the intake heads through tubes \u215c inch in diameter and there are 1,800 of them to each head. The air is employed to operate machinery and tools in an adjacent mine.\n\nOne advantage of this type of air compressor is that it cools the air while compressing it. This was hardly an advantage in the Catalan forges, but when the air is used to drive machinery it is important that it be precooled. When air is compressed by mechanical means a great deal of heat[93] is generated and the machines must be water jacketed to extract this heat, but in the hydraulic compressor the air bubbles are compressed as they pass down with the water to the reservoir and the water absorbs the heat, delivering cool compressed air at the bottom of the intake pipe.\n\n[94]\n\nCHAPTER VI\nLIQUID LEVERS AND GEARS\n\nMANY an inventor has strayed off into the delusive pursuit of perpetual motion because he did not know that the pressure in a body of water at any given point is equal in all directions, upward, downward, or laterally.\n\nA cubic foot of water weighs 62\u00bd pounds. Take a hollow column with an internal cross-sectional area of one square foot and if it be filled with water to a depth of ten feet there will be a weight of 625 pounds of water in the column and hence a pressure of 625 on the bottom of the tube or 4.34 pounds on every square inch of the bottom. But the water presses on the sides of the tube as well and the amount of this pressure depends upon the depth or \u201chead\u201d of water and not upon the quantity of water. At the bottom of the tube the pressure on the side walls is 625 pounds per square foot or 4.34 pounds per square inch; at a depth of one foot the pressure on the side walls is 62.5 pounds per square foot or .434 pound per square inch; at a depth of two feet it will be .864 pound per square inch, etc. The pressure on each square inch depends not upon the mass of the water but upon its depth. If the column of water had a cross-sectional area of a mile or a thousand miles, the pressure at a depth of one foot would always be .434 pound per square inch. (Of course there are slight variations from this figure due to salt or other substances dissolved in water[95] or to changes in density produced by variations of temperature, but we need not consider such minute differences here.) That is why a dam which is strong enough to hold back the waters of a pond will be just as able to hold back the waters of the whole ocean if it be placed in a sheltered bay where ocean waves cannot tear it to pieces. The ocean, despite its enormous mass, can exert no more pressure per foot of depth than the water in a cistern.\n\nWHY A SHIP FLOATS\nIt is because the pressure of water at a given depth is exerted upward, as well as laterally and downward, that a ship floats. It is the upward pressure of the water that holds up the boat. When an object is placed in a reservoir of water it sinks into zones of increasing pressure until it finally reaches a depth at which the pressure on the bottom of the object balances the weight of the body. If the body is entirely submerged before reaching such a point, it will continue to sink to the bottom of the reservoir because water will flow over the top of the object and keep adding downward pressure to offset the increasing upward pressure. The amount of water in the reservoir makes no difference. A battleship will float just as high in a flooded dry dock as it will in the open ocean. If the dry dock were so narrow as to leave a clearance of but a few inches of water around the ship, the latter would still float even though the ship weighed considerably more than the water in the dock.\n\nThere is a big difference, then, between the weight of water and the pressure it exerts. In Figure 38 we have an L-shaped receptacle with the lower arm of the L terminating in a chamber A. The top wall[96] B of this chamber measures ten square inches. The tube C has a cross sectional area of one square inch. If tube C is filled to a height of twelve inches above wall B we shall have an upward pressure of 0.434 pound on every square inch of wall B, or a total of 4.34 pounds. If by means of a plunger D we add a hundred pounds of pressure to the column of water in tube C, we shall be adding a thousand pounds to the pressure on the wall B. The side walls and bottom of the chamber A will also be subjected to a pressure of 1,000 pounds per inch plus the pressure due to the depth or head of water.\n\n\nFIG. 38.\u2014DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE\n\n\nTHE AIR-LOCK OF A PNEUMATIC CAISSON\n\n\nSUBAQUEOUS TUNNEL, SHOWING THE SHIELD IN THE BACKGROUND\n\n[97]\n\n\nFIG. 39.\u2014PRINCIPLE OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS\n\nHere, then, we have a convenient means of multiplying force or effort and it is a means that is used very largely in certain classes of machinery. Figure 39 is a diagrammatic representation of a hydraulic press. It consists of a cylinder A in which is fitted a ram B. An L-shaped tube C connects with the cylinder and is fitted with a plunger D. The cylinder and tube are filled with water and then when the plunger is depressed the ram B has to rise, If the area of the plunger is one square inch and that of the ram thirty square inches, a 100 pounds pressure on the plunger will exert 3,000 pounds of lift on the ram.\n\nHYDRAULIC LEVERAGE\nHowever, we must remember that in mechanics, as in all walks of life, we cannot get \u201csomething for nothing.\u201d If we multiply the pressure or force, we must pay for it in some way, otherwise we should be getting more work out of the press than we put in it, which is what the perpetual motion crank is ever trying to do. As the cross-sectional area of the plunger D is only 1/30th of that of the ram, the plunger must descend thirty inches to raise the ram one inch. We need not consider the difference in the head of water because it would not amount to[98] more than a few ounces at most, nor need we consider frictional losses. The case is parallel to that of the lever. In fact, we may consider the hydraulic press as a fluid lever with the water in tube C as the effort arm and that in cylinder A as the weight arm. The two arms are here so proportioned that the power arm must move thirty times as far as the weight arm. The work put into the press is exactly balanced by that we get out of it. An effort of 100 pounds exerted through a distance of thirty inches is exactly balanced by the moving of 3,000 pounds through a distance of one inch.\n\nIt is a decided disadvantage to have to move the plunger so far and in actual commercial practice hand-operated hydraulic presses are not worked in that way. A pump is used to force water into the cylinder so that a great many short strokes may be taken in place of one long one, and the pump handle provides an added leverage, enabling a man with little effort to exert an enormous lift. The water enters the ram cylinder through a valve, and the pressure is maintained on the ram until relieved by the opening of an outlet port.\n\nMAUDSLEY\u2019S LEATHER COLLAR\nAll this seems very simple and one would suppose that the inventor of the hydraulic press must have been exceptionally free from the troubles and trials that beset most inventors. However, there is a vast difference between a laboratory apparatus and a commercial machine. When, towards the close of the eighteenth century, Joseph Bramah, the eminent British tool builder, invented the hydraulic press, he experienced all sorts of difficulty in holding the water in the ram cylinder. Of course, the ram has[99] to slide freely into and out of the cylinder, but how could he prevent the water from leaking out past the ram? He resorted to all the plumbing expedients of the day. He used a stuffing box and gland, but when this was packed tight enough to hold the water in, it gripped the ram so tightly that the latter would not move down into the cylinder on the return stroke. Bramah had in his employ a very clever young mechanic named Henry Maudsley, who later became famous as an inventor and designer of machine tools. We read of him in Chapter III. Maudsley attacked the baffling problem of the hydraulic press and provided a solution that survives to this day. In place of the stuffing box which is a means of jamming a mass of cotton waste about the collar, he provided a cupped leather collar. When the pressure was applied it expanded the collar and made it bear tightly against the ram, but on relieving the hydraulic pressure the pressure of the cup leather was also reduced automatically.\n\nThere are many machines analogous to the hydraulic press in principle. They do not use water in every case for the fluid lever. Where the fluid is used over and over again oil is frequently employed. The compactness of this form of lever makes it most useful wherever an operation calls for the overcoming of a very heavy load or resistance through a relatively short distance. For instance, there are machines for bending pipe, for curving railroad rails, for punching holes in metal, for pulling wheels off their shafts, for jacking up heavy weights, for baling cotton, paper, and other materials, all of which operate on the same principle as the hydraulic press. Water pressure is supplied sometimes by a hand pump, sometimes by a[100] power-driven pump, and sometimes it is taken from a reservoir in which compressed air imparts the requisite pressure to the water.\n\nBLASTING WITH WATER\nA novel use of water pressure has been developed in England. In certain mines it is dangerous to use dynamite for blasting purposes owing to the presence of explosive gases, and successful experiments have been made with hydraulic cartridges. This consists of a cylinder of steel fitted with a series of little plungers arranged in a row in the cylindrical wall of the cartridge. As in powder blasting, a series of holes are drilled in the face of the rock and the cartridges with the plungers retracted are fitted into the holes. Then the cartridges are connected to a high-pressure water supply. The water forces the plungers out, exerting enough pressure to burst the rock. Not only is this system perfectly safe, but it is economical, because the gallery does not have to be cleared of workmen before every blast. There is more certainty in the use of water cartridges, and the danger, common where dynamite is used, of having the rock drill or pick strike and explode a stick of dynamite which failed to go off with the rest of the charge in a previous blast is avoided.\n\nHydraulic pressure is also used in jacks for lifting heavy weights. The principle of the hydraulic jack is the same as that of the hydraulic press.\n\nRAISING A BRIDGE SPAN WITH WATER\nAn interesting illustration of the use of these liquid levers was afforded in the construction of the Quebec Bridge. This huge bridge, it will be recalled,[101] consists of two cantilevers which stretch out from opposite shores of the St. Lawrence River and support between them a center span 640 feet long and weighing 5,400 tons. The span was built on barges, towed down to position between the cantilever arms and then lifted up 150 feet to the floor level of the bridge. Eight 1,000-ton hydraulic lifting jacks were used, two at each corner of the span. They were ideally suited to this kind of work. The bridge span had to be lifted with utmost care and the motion had to be simultaneous on all four corners. If one corner were raised faster than another the span would be twisted and subjected to serious strains. In the first attempt the fastening gave way at one corner and the span crumpled up and plunged down into the river. But a year later at the second attempt the span was hoisted successfully to position. The jacks had a lift of two feet, and, counting the time required to secure the huge plate chains by which the span was suspended, move the jacks down and give them a fresh hold, it took fourteen minutes to complete each two-foot lift. The work was done only during the daylight hours and on the third day the span was finally brought into position and made fast to the cantilever arms by means of twelve-inch pins driven home at each corner.\n\nHydraulic power is used very largely in the operation of cranes. As the plunger or ram has a very limited range of motion some means of multiplying distance of travel is required. One simple scheme is to use a set of pulley wheels or sheaves attached to the cylinder and another set to the ram and pass the hoisting chain around them. If we refer back to Figure 16, on page 34, we shall see that seven feet of rope must be pulled in at E in order to raise the[102] lower pulley block one foot. It is very evident that the process can be reversed. Power might be applied to spread the two-pulley blocks apart when a movement of one foot would produce a travel of seven feet at E. That is what is done on the hydraulic crane. The ram is lifted, spreading the pulley blocks apart and thus multiplying the motion of the lifting cable to any extent, depending upon the number of sheaves, so that a travel of but a few feet will result in lifting a load forty or fifty feet.\n\nHYDRAULIC ELEVATORS\nThe same principle is used in hydraulic elevators. The hydraulic cylinder lies horizontally on the basement floor and by means of pulley gearing a short motion of the plunger is sufficient to raise the car several stories.\n\nIn a more modern type of elevator the plunger acts directly on the car. The plunger is long enough to reach to the top story of the building which means that it must sink far into the ground in order to let the car down to the first story or basement. A steel pipe is sunk into the ground and serves as the cylinder and in this the long plunger operates. In one of New York\u2019s tall buildings the cars are lifted to a height of 282 feet. The plungers are 6\u00bd inches in diameter and they travel at a speed of over 400 feet per minute. The car which, when loaded, weighs 1,617 pounds, is supported on the top of the plunger. However, counterweights are provided which balance the weight of the car, so that practically the only weight lifted by the plunger is that of the passengers. The advantage of this type of elevator is that it reduces the danger of accident. The motion of the car is steady and easily controlled.[103] The car cannot move down above a given speed and the only possible danger is that the plunger might break. However, a shaft of steel 6\u00bd inches in diameter, even if hollow, is hardly likely to give way even under the most extraordinary loads to which it might be subjected in elevator service.\n\nLIFT LOCKS FOR CANALS\nThere is another type of elevator that completely dwarfs anything used in office buildings. On some canals where it is necessary to make a sudden change of level of considerable extent, instead of using a flight of locks, a hydraulic elevator is employed to lift or lower not only the vessel but the water it is floated in. There are two huge tanks which ply between the upper and lower levels of the canal. These are so connected that as one rises the other descends. The tanks are big enough to take in the largest vessels that are likely to use the canal. They are fitted with water-tight gates at each end, and after a vessel has entered one of them, say at the lower level, the gate behind it is closed. Then hydraulic mechanism is operated to lift the tank, and when the top is reached the other gate is opened and the vessel sails out into the upper level. It seems like a tremendous undertaking to lift a heavy ship, but the two tanks balance each other and the only work that has to be done is to overcome the friction and inertia. No matter how heavy a vessel may be, it will not disturb the balance between the two tanks. Nor is it necessary to have a ship in each tank, for the same depth of water is maintained in the two tanks, and when a ship enters the weight of the tank is not increased, for the ship displaces its own weight of water.\n\n[104]\n\nHYDRAULIC VARIABLE SPEED GEAR\nWater is frequently used to take the place of toothed gearing for the transmission of power, particularly where it is desirable to vary speed. One of the disadvantages of toothed gearing is that a change of speed can only be made by shifting gears. The speed cannot be varied gradually but is changed by abrupt steps. The guns of a battleship must be kept trained on the target, while the ship rolls in the waves under them, so as to be ready for a broadside at any instant. A telescope is secured to the barrel of the gun and a man known as a \u201cpointer\u201d tries to keep the cross-hairs of a telescope on the target by constantly elevating or depressing the gun. The speed of the elevating machinery must be constantly changing; now running at high speed, the next instant barely moving, and the next moment reversing.\n\nTo produce these variations a hydraulic variable speed gear is used. The construction is somewhat complicated, but the general principle of operation is simple. In a common pump water is lifted by operating a plunger in and out of a cylinder. It will be readily understood that the operation may be reversed, and if power is applied to the water to force it through the pump, it will make the plungers move in and out of the cylinder. In the hydraulic variable speed gear the driving shaft is made to operate a set of little pumps which are connected to a second series of pumps that act upon the driven shaft. Instead of water oil is used, and the oil pumped by the driving pumps is forced into the driven pumps. The latter pumps are so connected to the driven shaft as to cause it to rotate. But by[105] a simple mechanical expedient the stroke of the driving pumps can be varied at will from maximum to zero, and the motion of the pumps can also be reversed. The variable amount of oil pumped into the driven pumps varies the speed of the driven shaft, for if it takes two strokes of a driving pump to fill the cylinder of a driven pump the driven shaft will travel at only half the speed of the driving shaft.\n\nIn turbine-driven vessels some sort of gearing is required between the propeller and the turbine. In order to operate at its best efficiency a turbine must run at very high speed, but this speed is entirely too high for the propeller. There is a limit to the rate at which a propeller may be driven. If this limit is exceeded, the propeller merely bores a hole in the water, forming a vacuum which produces a drag on the ship. It is customary to interpose some form of gearing between the propeller and the turbine shaft, but because of the high speed and the vast amount of power to be transmitted it is a difficult matter to design gearing that will be reliable. Furthermore, it is desirable to vary the speed of the vessel and even to reverse it without slowing down the turbine engine. In some cases a specially designed system of toothed gearing has been employed, in another the power of the turbine is converted into electricity and then reconverted into mechanical power by means of a motor on the propeller shaft. This provides a very efficient transmission, because the electricity can be very conveniently controlled to accelerate, retard, or reverse the speed of the propeller motor. The same thing can also be done by using a hydraulic transmission gear. This, although quite different from the[106] variable-speed gear, yet operates on the same general principle. The turbine drives a centrifugal pump and the water thus pumped is fed to a horizontal water turbine on the propeller shaft. By an ingenious arrangement of turbine wheels the speed of the propeller shaft may be varied at will.\n\nHydraulic machinery is notable for its reliability. Sometimes water or oil is used as a convenient means of transmitting pressure from one part of a machine to another. If we take a tube filled with water and fit a plunger in each end, then, when one plunger is depressed or pushed in, the other will be expressed or pushed out. The pipe may be twisted around in any direction or be tied up in a double bowknot, and yet pressure applied to one cylinder will immediately be felt by the other. This method of transmission may do away with a vast number of gears or levers.\n\nWater is comparatively incompressible and hence not a very adaptable means of transmitting power, but a certain amount of flexibility is secured in some systems by the use of what is termed an \u201caccumulator.\u201d This consists of a large cylinder fitted with a plunger. The plunger is heavily weighted and it maintains a constant pressure upon the column of water in the cylinder. If, for instance, a hydraulic crane is being used and suddenly a larger quantity of water is required than would normally be delivered by a pump, it is automatically supplied from the cylinder of the accumulator, and at a constant pressure. The accumulator is arranged to control the throttle valve of the steam pumping engine so that when the plunger of the accumulator reaches a predetermined height the stream is cut off and the engine stops pumping.\n\n[107]\n\nTRANSMITTING POWER WITH SOUND WAVES\nDuring the war a new use of water for power transmission was discovered and it is now being developed for the operation of mining machinery. The inventor of the new transmission is George Constantinesco, a Rumanian engineer. His first application of the invention was to a mechanism for synchronizing the firing of a machine gun with the rotation of an airplane propeller, so that it was possible to fire through the propeller without danger of striking its blades. There were several existing methods of gearing the propeller to the machine gun, but Constantinesco\u2019s system proved so much more reliable that it was adopted and widely used by the British in their battle planes.\n\nInstead of gears and levers, the Rumanian engineer used a column of water in a heavy steel tube to conduct impulses from the propeller to the machine gun. The pulsations produced by the propeller were too rapid to cause an actual displacement of the whole column of water in the tube, but a wave of pressure traveled through the water column at an enormously high velocity.\n\nWe are wont to think of liquids as incompressible, but they are actually slightly compressible and highly elastic. This is demonstrated by the submarine telephone or the submarine bell. Water, we know, is an excellent medium for the transmission of sound, but sound, we know, is produced by a succession of pressure waves. If water were absolutely incompressible, it could not convey sound from one point to another. When sound travels through a speaking tube the whole column of air does not move back and forth simultaneously, but it[108] is divided into a series of waves. Each particle of air has a local oscillatory motion which it communicates to its neighbor, producing alternate compression and rarefication, and it is this wave action that travels through the column. The same is true of water, except that the rate of travel of the pressure wave in water is much higher than in air, namely 4,800 feet per second. It is this wave transmission that Constantinesco employed and which he calls \u201csonic\u201d wave transmission.\n\nTo-day sonic wave transmission is used to operate rock drills. A wave generator is used, which acts somewhat on the principle of a pump. A pair of plungers are reciprocated at a rate of forty strokes per second by means of an electric or gasoline motor, and they produce a train of pressure waves in a column of water. The water is contained in a specially designed flexible steel piping which runs to the rock drill. The pressure waves operate a plunger in the drill and the plunger carries the drill steel. The latter pounds the rock under the wave impulses at the rate of forty strokes per second.\n\nSonic wave transmission is analogous to alternating current transmission of electricity. There are direct equivalents in the wave transmission, of volts, amperes, frequency, angle of phase, induction, inductance, capacity, resistance, condensers, transformers, and single-phase or polyphase systems.\n\n[109]\n\nCHAPTER VII\nAIR VS. WATER\n\nTHE STEAM engine had its origin in a kitchen; the modern clock was first conceived in a cathedral; our laws of motion were discovered under an apple tree, but, strangest of all, pneumatic engineering had its beginning in a barber shop. In each case it was an inquisitive boy who played the leading r\u00f4le.\n\nWe do not hear much about the youthful father of pneumatic engineering, possibly because he lived so very long ago, but his story is fully as interesting as that of Watt or Galileo or Newton. Young Ctesibius dwelt in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, 250 years before the birth of Christ. His father kept a barber shop, and the young lad used to watch his father practice his tonsorial art on the Greek and Egyptian dandies of the time. No doubt Ctesibius\u2019s father expected to make a first-rate barber of his son, but history does not tell us much about his early life.\n\nThe barbers of those days had their mirrors as do the barbers of the present time. But a mirror in those days was a treasured possession. It consisted of a brightly polished plate of metal in which a person could see himself \u201cdarkly\u201d or it might have been a plate of glass with a black backing. These mirrors had to be carefully preserved from injury and from moisture, and so, instead of having them mounted on the wall as in a modern barber shop,[110] they were stowed carefully away and brought out only after the tonsorial artist had completed his operation and was ready to exhibit his finished product to the customer.\n\nTHE BOY WHO DISCOVERED COMPRESSED AIR\nNow in the tonsorial parlors of Ctesibius\u2019s father the precious mirror was suspended above the head of the customer and when the barber had finished the shave or haircut he pulled down the mirror and let the customer survey his remodeled countenance. After the customer viewed himself to his heart\u2019s content he merely released the mirror and it was automatically drawn back into place by a counterweight that slid in a case fastened to the wall. Young Ctesibius noticed that every time the mirror was released a curious whistling sound came from the case in which the counterweight moved. No doubt this phenomenon had been recurring day after day for years, but it excited no more curiosity than would a squeaky door, until, one day, the barber\u2019s son happened to notice it. Immediately he was all curiosity. No one knew anything about air in those days and the boy could get no satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, so he started an investigation of his own. He found that the counterweight fitted very closely in its case and when it dropped it forced a stream of \u201cwind\u201d out of a crevice which produced a whistling sound. That set Master Ctesibius to thinking. He had discovered a method of harnessing the wind. No more barber shop for him; he was launched upon a career of scientific research and invention.\n\nThe first use he made of his discovery was to build a pipe organ which was driven by a water wheel[111] and hence was known as a water organ. But there were other and more lucrative fields for the newly discovered power. Being invisible, compressed air proved a most valuable medium for performing seemingly miraculous tricks with which the corrupt priesthood of that time hoodwinked the public. Naturally such air-controlled apparatus was kept secret, and we have only a meager record of a few of the ingenious devices used in the temples. However, Ctesibius made many scientific discoveries and became the most famous mathematician and scientist of his age. We have read in Chapter IV of his famous water clock adjusted to record hours of varying length according to the season.\n\nWhile Ctesibius is credited with being the first man to make scientific use of compressed air, the use of free air or wind as a power far antedates him. Sailing vessels were probably in use long before windmills were invented. As pointed out elsewhere, windmills possessed an advantage over water wheels in that they could be placed anywhere, instead of being confined to the banks of streams. They were widely used for pumping water, grinding grain, and sawing wood until the steam engine arrived and displaced them.\n\nAlthough wind power is but little used to-day, air is much more widely used in modern machinery than is generally realized. A catalogue of the various devices in which it plays a prominent part is likely to prove astonishing. For instance, we employ it to bore through rock, to stop the speeding express train, and even to quell ocean billows. Being elastic and compressible, it makes an ideal spring for the storage of power and a cushion for absorbing shocks. It is also used to fight back water and permit[112] men to work in the depths of the sea or in water-bearing sand and earth.\n\nDespite his extensive use of air Ctesibius knew nothing of the atmospheric pressure. It was not until the seventeenth century that atmospheric pressure was discovered and measured. It was then learned that there is no such thing as suction.\n\nRAISING WATER WITH ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\n\nFIG. 40.\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A SUCTION PUMP\n\nA suction pump should be called an atmospheric pump. The operation of such a pump is illustrated in Figure 40. A piston A slides in a cylinder B. There is an opening in the bottom of the cylinder which is normally closed by a clack valve C that opens upwardly. There is a similar valve D in the piston A. When the piston is pushed down it compresses the air in the cylinder, closing the valve C while valve D opens, permitting the air to escape. Then on the upward stroke the valve D closes and valve C opens permitting air to flow into the cylinder.[113] In this way the air in the pipe and cylinder are exhausted after a few strokes. As the air is rarefied and the pressure is reduced above the column of water in the pipe the greater pressure of the water outside the pipe forces the column to rise until it eventually flows through the valve in the piston and out of the spout of the pump. The maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump is thirty-four feet but in actual practice the lift seldom exceeds twenty-six to twenty-eight feet because the fit between the cylinder and piston is not perfect.\n\n\nFIG. 41.\u2014CONVENTIONALIZED SECTIONAL VIEW OF A FORCE PUMP\n\nWhen water is raised to a greater height a force pump is used. Such a pump is shown in Figure 41. The pump cylinder A has two valves B and C. The valve B opens upwardly and valve C opens downwardly. The piston D is a solid member containing no valve. When the piston rises the valve C closes and valve B opens, letting water into the cylinder. On the reverse stroke the valve B closes and the[114] descending piston forces the water out through valve C into pipe E. The height to which the water may be lifted depends upon the power applied to the piston and not upon atmospheric pressure. In a fire pump two force pumps are used which alternately deliver water into an air chamber. The air is compressed by the water that enters the chamber and exerts a steady pressure on the water, forcing it out through the fire hose in a stream that is practically steady.\n\nIt is a decided disadvantage to install a force pump in a deep well because of the mechanical difficulty of operating the piston at a great depth. Often the suction and force pump principles are combined. The force pump piston and cylinder are located twenty-six and twenty-eight feet above the level of the water in the well with a pipe leading down into the water. The water is forced up into the cylinder by exhausting the air in the cylinder and pipe and then is forced out of the cylinder and up a pipe to the top of the well. This also has its disadvantages. In deep wells the pump piston must still be located and operated at considerable depth.\n\nTHE AIR LIFT\nA much more simple pump for deep wells is the air lift in which there are no valves and no piston. The pump consists of two pipes that are let down into the water. (See Figure 42.) The larger pipe is open at the top and bottom, and the smaller pipe discharges air into the bottom of the larger one. This air being directed upward has a lifting effect, and mingling with the water in the pipe produces a sort of froth which is so much lighter than solid water that the atmospheric pressure on the water[115] in the well is sufficient to raise the froth. The water is thoroughly aerated and to a large extent purified by this system of pumping, so that the air lift commends itself particularly for city waterworks. Sometimes a series of air lifts are used which lift water by successive stages to a greater height than would be possible with a single direct lift.\n\n\nFIG. 42.\u2014PUMPING WATER WITH COMPRESSED AIR\n\nEXCAVATING THROUGH QUICKSAND\n[116]\n\n\nFIG. 43.\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A PNEUMATIC CAISSON\n\nCenturies ago it was realized that it would be possible for men to descend into the open sea if they were protected by a bell-shaped chamber, for the air trapped in the chamber would furnish them with oxygen requisite for breathing purposes, and would prevent the water from drowning them out. This same idea of a diving bell is used on land when sinking a shaft through quicksand or water-bearing strata. A large box or caisson is used. (See Figure 43.) This box may be either cylindrical or rectangular, and it is open at the top and bottom. The lower edges of the box are shod with steel and form cutting edges that will sink into the soil that is being excavated. At a height of about seven feet above the bottom of the box there is a transverse diaphragm known as the deck, and the space below is known as the working chamber.[117] This deck is very strongly constructed, as it has to support the weight of the concrete shaft that is built above it. Laborers, commonly known as \u201csand hogs,\u201d enter the working chamber and dig out a shallow pit in the floor of clay or sand. This pit is then extended to the cutting edges of the caisson. The caisson thus undermined settles down into the excavation and another pit is started. In this way, step by step, the caisson is sunk into the ground. In order to overcome the friction of the caisson against the sides of the excavation and to insure its sinking, it is heavily weighted. When water-bearing sand is reached, compressed air is admitted into the working chamber to force the water out. When the air pressure is greater than the water pressure it drives the water out of the sand in the working chamber, so that the men can work in perfectly dry ground, even though the surrounding sand may be so saturated with water as to form a quicksand.\n\nOf course the farther the excavation proceeds below the water level the greater the air pressure required, and the caisson would be blown up out of the ground by this air pressure or would float on the water were it not for the weights with which it is loaded. When an open shaft is to be dug, pig iron is loaded on the caisson to force it down, but in most work the object is merely to sink a concrete column down to rock and so the caisson is filled with concrete above the deck. Sections are added to the caisson as it sinks into the ground, and these sections are filled with concrete. This method of building the column facilitates the work of laying the concrete, and at the same time provides the weight necessary to overcome the buoyancy of the caisson[118] and the skin friction on the side walls of the excavation.\n\nAfter the caisson has been carried down to rock and a good seat has been blasted out of solid rock, the working chamber is completely filled with concrete and the concrete shaft is thus anchored to the rock.\n\nTHE AIR LOCK\nAccess to the working chamber is had through a central shafting. In order to hold the air pressure in the working chamber and yet provide for the entrance of men and materials, an air lock is fitted to the upper end of the shafting. This air lock, as shown in Figure 43, consists of a chamber formed with a trapdoor at the top and the bottom. Both doors open downwardly. To enter the caisson, the bottom door of the chamber must first be closed and means are provided for doing this from outside the air lock. The compressed air in the chamber is then let out through a valve, and when the pressure drops almost to normal the upper trapdoor falls open of its own weight, giving access to the chamber. After entering, the upper door is closed while compressed air is admitted into the chamber; the air pressure then serves to hold the upper trapdoor closed. The bottom door, in the meantime, has been kept closed by the air pressure below, which is greater than that above the door. But after sufficient air has been introduced into the chamber to equalize the pressure on both sides of the lower trapdoor, it falls open of its own weight. The occupants of the chamber can then proceed down a ladder to the working chamber. When leaving the caisson, the action of the air lock is reversed. The bottom door is pushed up and held closed for a moment[119] while air is released from the chamber, when the greater pressure beneath will hold the door closed, and after the pressure within the air lock has been lowered practically to normal, the upper door drops of its own weight, permitting the occupants of the chamber to climb out. The same process must be undergone by buckets loaded with sand or earth from the excavation and by empty buckets returning to the working chamber.\n\nMore time is required for a man to pass through an air lock than for a load of sand or any inanimate load. In some of the larger caissons a separate small air lock is provided just for the use of the workmen. In the air lock the pressure must be built up slowly so that it will permeate a man\u2019s whole system. When we realize that the pressure that men have to support in caisson work may amount to from fifty to one hundred tons on the whole body, it is difficult at first to understand why the body is not flattened out like a pancake. It is only by permitting the system to absorb the pressure so that there is as much internal pressure as that outside that a man is able to enter a compressed air chamber without harmful results.\n\nTHE CAISSON DISEASE\nCompression is rather annoying to a man who has not experienced the sensation, but the principal danger comes in decompression, particularly after a person has been in the working chamber for a long time. When breathing compressed air much larger volumes of oxygen are taken into the lungs at each breath than in the ordinary atmosphere, and one feels decidedly exhilarated by this unusual supply of stimulating oxygen. But with the oxygen large[120] volumes of nitrogen are taken into the system as well. The nitrogen permeates the blood while the oxygen is consumed and exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide. The longer a man is exposed to the pressure the more nitrogen does he absorb. When the pressure is released suddenly the nitrogen begins to froth, just as a bottle of soda water does when the stopper is removed. The nitrogen bubbles in the small veins stop the circulation and produce the dreaded \u201ccaisson disease\u201d which makes itself felt in the form of severe cramps and excruciating pains. Not infrequently this disease ends in death. By reducing the pressure gradually the nitrogen is enabled to pass off completely without bubbling or frothing, just as it is possible to let out the gas from a soda bottle without frothing by permitting it to escape through a pin hole in the stopper. The surest cure for a victim of the caisson disease is to put him immediately into what is known as a \u201chospital tank\u201d and build up the pressure in the tank equal to that which he has just been subjected to in the caisson, after which the air in the tank is let out so slowly that there is plenty of time for the nitrogen to pass off without forming bubbles.\n\nA pressure of forty-five pounds per square inch above that of the atmosphere is considered a severe pressure for excavation work. But work has been carried on in pressures up to fifty-two pounds, corresponding to a depth of 120 feet below water level.\n\nNow that the cause of the caisson disease is understood formulas have been worked out to insure proper decompression. On one occasion a diver descended 306 feet into the ocean where the water pressure was 133 pounds on[121] every square inch of his body. This meant that the air which was pumped down to him had to be compressed to the same pressure. The diver actually remained at the bottom only a very short time, but it took two hours and three-quarters to bring him to the surface. He came up half the distance very quickly and then had to rest on the bottom rung of a Jacob\u2019s ladder. The rungs on this ladder were ten feet apart and he was instructed to rest on each rung a certain specified time. When he was ten feet below the surface he had to wait three-quarters of an hour for the last trace of nitrogen absorbed by his blood to pass off.\n\nBORING TUNNELS THROUGH RIVER BEDS\nIt is comparatively simple to sink a vertical shaft into water-bearing soil, but a horizontal shaft involves serious difficulties. The action of a diving bell is easily illustrated by inverting a tumbler and pressing it down into a basin of water. The air trapped in the tumbler will keep the upper part of the glass dry, and by inserting a tube in the tumbler it is possible to fill the tumbler so full of compressed air as to drive out all the water. This is virtually what is done in the caisson; but when excavating a horizontal bore, the caisson must be turned on its side. Turn the tumbler on its side and it is impossible to keep the water out of it, no matter how much air we may blow into it. The reason for this is that the pressure on the open end of the tumbler is not uniform. At the bottom, where the water is deeper, it will be greater than at the top. If air is pumped in to equalize the water pressure at the upper edge of the glass, it will not prevent water from flowing in at the bottom; and if it be equal to that at[122] the bottom, the water pressure at the top cannot hold the air in and keep it from pouring out.\n\n\nFIG. 44.\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A TUNNEL SHIELD\n\nFortunately most of the soil through which a subaqueous tunnel is driven is not very fluid. It is either sticky, as in clay, or sluggish enough to prevent the water from flowing in rapidly. If there is enough cover of silt or earth above the tunnel bore, it will help to hold the air in the tunnel. When the bore comes very close to the surface of the bed of the stream that is being tunneled, loads of clay are dumped along the line of the tunnel to provide the requisite cover. In tunnel boring a shield is used which is the equivalent of the caisson in vertical boring. The shield is a cylindrical box with a diaphragm across it corresponding to the deck of the caisson. (See Figure 44.) In front of the diaphragm there is a small working chamber which is protected above by an extension of the shield known as an apron. In the diaphragm there are a number of doors at different levels, which may be closed in case of danger. If work is proceeding near the top of the shield, the upper doors are opened and the pressure is regulated to equal the water pressure[123] at that level. If the work is carried on near the bottom of the shield, the upper doors are closed and only the lower doors are open, and the pressure is increased to equal the water pressure at that point. Sometimes the material is of such a nature that the men can safely pass out of the doors into the working chamber outside, but more often it is possible to work only within a limited area immediately in front of the doors.\n\nWhen the material is very soft it is often unnecessary to do any actual excavation by hand in front of the diaphragm. The shield is merely pushed forward through the mud or silt and the doors are opened to let the material flow in through them. Workmen dig out this mud and it is hauled out of the tunnel. Whenever bowlders are encountered it is necessary for the men to work outside of the diaphragm to chip away the rocks with compressed-air drills, or else bore them and blast them with small charges of dynamite.\n\nIn quicksand the material is so fluid that it is unsafe to open the ordinary doors of the caisson, and they are then provided with shutters which are raised one at a time, to permit of operating on a very small section of the head of the tunnel. After enough material has been excavated from in front of the shield, the latter is pushed forward and the excavating is renewed.\n\nUnlike caisson work, the weight of the shield is of no assistance in making it penetrate the soil, nor is it possible to move the entire lining of the tunnel with the shield. The tunnel is lined with rings of cast iron which are bolted together, the rings themselves being made up of heavily ribbed curved plates. The shield is formed with a \u201ctail[124]\u201d which fits over the end of the tunnel line like a cap. When the shield is to be pushed forward, a set of hydraulic jacks are fitted between the end of the tunnel lining and the diaphragm of the shield, and by means of these the shield is given a shove forward far enough for a new section of the cast-iron lining to be added within the tail. The tunnel-lining rings are usually sixteen inches wide so that it is customary to move the shield ahead sixteen inches at a time or just far enough for a new ring of lining to be installed. Of course, the tunnel is fitted with air locks by which men can enter the working section without permitting the compressed air therein to escape, and these locks are just like those used in sinking a caisson, except that they are horizontal instead of vertical.\n\nQUELLING OCEAN BILLOWS WITH AIR\nAir is also used in another and very novel way to battle against water. In this case it is not quiet water pressure, but the tremendous power of ocean storms that is combatted.\n\nThe influence of a shoal upon ocean waves has often been observed. A sand barrier even when submerged to a depth of twenty or thirty feet will break the waves of a heavy storm and leave an area of comparatively quiet water behind it. The reason for this is that the water in the waves does not travel with the waves, but undergoes local oscillatory motion. This motion is in the form of circular or elliptical currents which travel in a vertical plane. When a sand bar is encountered it interferes with these local currents and breaks up the waves.\n\nKnowing this to be the case, it occurred to Mr. Philip Brasher that some other means of disturbing[125] the rhythmic movement of the water might be found, and he determined to try the experiment of using compressed air for this purpose. Accordingly he laid a perforated pipe under water and connected it with an air compressor. Then when a storm arose air was pumped into the pipe and it rose in bubbles through the water. The effect of this upward movement of air was instantly observable. It upset the rhythmic water currents and the waves which struck this wall of air bubbles curled and broke as if they had encountered a shoal of sand.\n\nSeveral exposed piers on the Pacific coast have had a pneumatic breakwater built around them so as to protect them or ships lying alongside from being pounded by the waves. There is no expense attached to the breakwater except in time of storm when the air pumps must be kept going. One important advantage of the breakwater is that it does not block navigation. A ship can sail right over the wall of bubbles and find refuge behind it.\n\n[126]\n\nCHAPTER VIII\nAIR SPRINGS AND CUSHIONS\n\nUNLIKE water, air is a highly compressible, elastic fluid, and as such furnishes an excellent medium for the storage of energy. It acts just like a clock spring into which energy may be introduced and stored by winding or compressing the spring. The energy remains locked up in the spring and when the spring is released, it gives back just as much energy as was put into it, except for slight frictional and heat losses. Air is a much better spring than steel or any other metal because it never loses its elasticity from fatigue and because it has an enormous capacity for the storage of energy. It possesses one serious drawback, however. Much of the energy that is expended in compressing it is converted into heat. If the air were to be used immediately and without transmitting it to a distance, there would be no advantage in extracting the heat, but heat cannot be stored in air for long and it would gradually escape from the storage reservoir or air receiver and from the pipes leading the air to the machines that it was to operate. As the heat escaped it would lower the pressure of the air and hence much of the energy would be lost.\n\nHEAT OF COMPRESSION\nIn Chapter V we described a hydraulic system of compressing air and noted that one of the advantages[127] of this system is that it delivers air cooled to the temperature of the water. This, of course, does not mean that there is no loss due to heat. The air bubbles as they are compressed are cooled by the water that compresses them; in other words, the heat of compression passes off into the water, making the water warmer than it would otherwise be. Heat is not produced without expenditure of energy and a certain proportion of the water power is thus wasted.\n\nIn most cases air is compressed by steam or electrically driven compressors, and in such machines the heat due to compression is a serious matter. The air cylinders are water-jacketed to carry off the heat. But air is a poor conductor; it acquires heat faster than it can give it off to the water surrounding the cylinders. In compound air compressors the air compressed in one cylinder is cooled before being passed on to the next cylinder, where it is further compressed. The heat loss in compressing air in a single stage up to 100 pounds gauge pressure is about 30 per cent. Air that enters a compressor at the normal pressure of the atmosphere and with an initial temperature of 60 degrees F., if not cooled will become heated to 415 pounds gauge pressure. The higher the initial heat of the air, the greater the rise of temperature. If a volume of air be subjected to 294 pounds gauge pressure, it will occupy about one-tenth of its former volume. If the air was introduced into the compressor at zero, it would acquire a temperature of about 650 degrees; if introduced at 60 degrees, it would show an increase of about 800 degrees; and, if started at 100 degrees, it would show an increase of 900 degrees in passing through the compressor. This shows the advantage[128] of compressing the air in stages and cooling the air between stages.\n\nSometimes the heat developed is sufficient to produce a disastrous explosion. Air is noncombustible, but the oils used to lubricate the compressor are vaporized by the heat and when mixed with air form a powerful explosive. Care has to be taken that none but high-grade oil with a high flash point be used in the compressor and that the temperature of compression does not rise to near the flash point lest the vaporized oil be ignited.\n\nThat fire can be produced by sudden compression of air has long been known in the Philippine Islands. The natives use a small air tube with a close-fitting plunger. Combustible matter is placed in the bottom of the tube, and on striking the plunger a sharp blow this is ignited.\n\nWhen compressed air is used in an air motor it expands and in so doing absorbs heat. The more rapidly it expands, the more heat it absorbs. This heat it extracts from the motor and from the atmosphere into which it escapes, and it is a common occurrence to find a thick coating of frost around the exhaust port. This is due to condensation of moisture in the atmosphere or in the compressed air itself, which, because of the rapid extraction of heat, is converted into snow. On cold days enough frost may be produced in the exhaust pipe to clog it and interrupt the operation of the motor, and frost sometimes clogs the air lines leading to the motor.\n\n\nWHARF ON THE PACIFIC COAST PROTECTED BY A PNEUMATIC BREAKWATER\n\nAir issuing from the submerged perforated pipes breaks up the waves\n\n\nGENERAL VIEW OF A SUN POWER PLANT IN EGYPT\n\n\nCLOSE-UP OF ONE OF THE REFLECTORS SHOWING THE BOILER\n\n[129]\n\nThe fact that compressed air on expanding is cooled, makes it an ideal power for use in mining machinery. Steam is inconvenient because of the difficulty of transmitting it to the machines without loss of heat, because it would heat the machines so that they cannot be handled readily and because the exhaust steam would fill the mine with an impenetrable fog; electricity is dangerous in mines that are apt to contain explosive gases, because the wires are liable to be broken and cause sparks by short circuiting, and because sparks are likely to form between the brushes and commutators of the motors; but compressed air has none of these objections, and, furthermore, the discharge from the machines furnishes the operators with ample supplies of fresh cool air which drives out disagreeable and dangerous gases.\n\nAIR-DRIVEN HAMMERS\nThe ordinary rock drill is really a pneumatic hammer. The tool, which is chisel-shaped, is used as a hammer to pound a hole in the rock. The tool is driven up and down or in and out by compressed air bearing alternately on opposite sides of a piston. The elasticity of the compressed air acts as a cushion to relieve the machine from shock. The drill is mounted upon a tripod in such a way that it may be operated in any direction.\n\nThe pneumatic riveter is another form of compressed-air hammer. The machine is held in the hands, and the tool, which is rapidly reciprocated by air pressure, pounds the red-hot shank of a rivet. While this is being done an assistant holds a hammer against the head of the rivet. However, there is a type of riveter which has a U-shaped frame. One arm of the frame carries the reciprocating tool while the other reaches around and bears against the head of the rivet.\n\nAll sorts of tools have been built in which a small air-driven motor furnishes the motive power. There are hand drills in which the tool is revolved by a set[130] of pistons, shears for shearing sheep which operate somewhat on the principle of hair clippers, and pneumatic chisels used for chipping stone. Pneumatic motors are widely used in operating cranes and air hoists. They consist of a simple cylinder and piston, and are used for short, direct lifts of all sorts.\n\nSTOPPING TRAINS WITH AIR\nAir has played a most important part in transportation. When the air brake was first introduced its purpose was to prevent collisions and provide greater safety of operation. It was not generally realized that efficient air brakes are not only a safety precaution, but a means of increasing schedule speeds. The more quickly a train can stop, the better speed it may make, particularly on a schedule that calls for frequent stops.\n\nIn the first air brake invented by George Westinghouse, the locomotive was provided with a reservoir in which air was stored and compressed by means of a steam-operated air pump. The cars were each provided with a cylinder and piston connected to the air reservoir through a valve conveniently located in the engineer\u2019s cab. The piston of the air cylinder was connected with the air brakes so that whenever the engineer wished to stop his train he merely turned on the compressed air and all the brakes in the train were operated. This was a great saving over the previous system of providing brakemen to operate hand brakes.\n\nUnfortunately, the problem of stopping a train was not as simple as all this. On a long train the cylinders near the engine were the first to receive pressure sufficient to operate the brakes, and as a result, the forward part of the train was retarded[131] more than the rear part at the start of the brake operation, and the train came to a stop with a series of jolts. Another serious disadvantage was the fact that an enormous reservoir was required to furnish all the air necessary for a long train. But the most serious drawback was the fact that occasionally a train broke apart and then the engineer was powerless to control the brakes of the detached portion of the train. If the accident occurred on a down grade, there would result a collision between the cars running by their own momentum and gravity and those attached to the engine. This led to the present system of reversing the process which consists in keeping air pressure constantly in the train pipe and setting the brakes by relieving the pressure in the train pipe.\n\nEach car is provided with its own cylinder which furnishes the necessary air for the operation of its brakes. There is, of course, a main cylinder on the locomotive in which air is pumped at high pressure by a steam-operated pump. When the pressure of the main reservoir falls below a predetermined amount, the air pump starts operating automatically and continues until the requisite pressure is restored. Air from the reservoir is fed to the train pipe at a certain pressure and feeds the local reservoirs on the cars of the train. At each car it passes through a very ingenious triple valve, which consists of a cylinder with a double piston, one operated by pressure in the train pipe, and the other by pressure in the local cylinder. The piston operated by the pressure of the train pipe is larger than the other and consequently the valve piston is normally pressed back, uncovering a small port through which air from the train pipe feeds into the local reservoir. In[132] this way the air in each local reservoir is maintained at the same pressure as that of the train pipe. Whenever air is let out of the train pipe, the piston is pushed out by the excess pressure on the local reservoir side and uncovers another port which permits air to flow from the local reservoir to the brake cylinder operating the brakes. The advantage of this system is that each car is always supplied with sufficient power to act on the brakes immediately without having to draw its supply of air from the main reservoir. In case the train breaks apart, the air in the train pipe escapes and the brakes are set automatically.\n\nThere have been a number of improvements in air brakes aimed to make the operation of the brakes more uniform and to insure immediate action, even on a very long train. Modern express trains weighing 920 tons and traveling at a velocity of 60 miles per hour, can be brought to a standstill in 860 feet, or practically their own length. Automatic arrangements are provided to insure the application of the brakes at graduated rate, except, of course, when the emergency brakes are applied. As the speed of the train slows down the pressure is gradually relieved, otherwise the train would stop with a severe jolt. The rate of applying the brakes so as to provide a smooth retardation depends in large measure upon the weight of the train.\n\nOn the New York subways, it is interesting to note, every passenger who boards a train has his weight recorded by the brake mechanism, and allowance is automatically made for the inertia that his mass adds to the train when it is in motion. The weight operates through a system of levers to control the amount of pressure that is applied to the[133] brakes so that when the engineer operates the brake lever, he does not have to consider whether the cars are light or jammed full of passengers; the brake mechanism itself takes care of this.\n\nPROPELLING CARS WITH AIR\nIf air can be used to stop a train, why cannot air be used to propel it? This question occurred to many inventors and they answered it by building air-propelled cars and locomotives. Pneumatic cars were tried out on street railways, but they have had to give way to electric cars which do not need to carry their power around with them, but can draw it from a central power plant through a trolley wire. In only a few situations, such as in mines where electric sparking is feared, are air-propelled cars and locomotives still used to any considerable extent.\n\nHowever, air plays another and highly important part in transportation and here it is employed not to deliver energy stored in it, but to serve as a cushion. Without the soft, flexible grip of the air-filled rubber tubes with which automobile wheels are shod, high-speed motoring would be practically impossible. There is nothing that can compare with air for absorbing shocks and unevennesses in the road. Whenever an obstruction is encountered, not only is the shock absorbed by elasticity of the air, but the impact is immediately distributed uniformly over the whole tire, so that the strain on the tire is not localized and the life of the tire is correspondingly increased. There have been many attempts to introduce substitutes for pneumatic tires, such as combinations of metallic springs and straps, but these have failed, chiefly for the reason that they cannot distribute the shock as the pneumatic tire[134] does. Consequently they are not only liable to damage, but they do not absorb the obstructions as readily as the pneumatic tire does and the vehicle which they carry is subjected to heavy stresses and strains.\n\nAir as a cushion is used to prevent the rebound of the springs of an automobile and is also widely employed in machinery to absorb the momentum of moving parts or to slow the action of a spring. In a door check, for instance, a powerful spring is provided which would slam the door shut were it not for the cushioning action of air. A plunger is connected to the door and slides in a cylinder on the door frame. The air compressed by the plunger can escape only very slowly through a small port.\n\nAIR CUSHIONS FOR ELEVATORS\nAir cushions are used in elevators to prevent too rapid a fall of the car in case of accident. The lower part of the elevator shaft is completely inclosed and fitted with steel doors to form an air pocket. The car fits the shaft closely enough to compress the air under it when it is moving downward. At normal speeds, this air escapes quite readily around the sides of the car and through cracks in the doors, but when the speed is excessive the air cannot escape fast enough and sufficient pressure is built up to retard the car so that it will strike the bottom with a moderate impact not at all dangerous to the passengers.\n\nIn the Woolworth Building, New York, the highest elevator shafts are 680 feet high and the air pockets are 137 feet deep\u2014i. e., they reach up to the tenth story. If the car broke away from its supports at the top of the shaft it would be traveling at the rate of 132 miles an hour when it struck the air pocket,[135] but before it reached the bottom the air would bring it practically to a stop. Imagine a heavy automobile traveling at 132 miles per hour and brought down to a standstill in half a city block! The passengers would be hurled out of their seats, but in an elevator the passengers are standing and can brace themselves against the pressure produced by their own momentum. The velocity acquired in falling 543 feet to the air pocket must be overcome in 137 feet or \u00bc of the distance. This means that the weight of each passenger is multiplied by four. A man who weighed 150 pounds would find that his pressure on the floor of the car had mounted to 600 pounds. One of the inventors of the pneumatic cushion for elevators was killed when testing out a car, not because of the impact of the car, but because he was foolish enough to sit in a chair. The chair gave way under his suddenly acquired weight and the poor man was fatally stabbed by one of the splinters.\n\nAir jets are used for a variety of purposes ranging from tamping railway tracks to painting buildings. When a track is depressed under the tamping action of trains passing over it the ties must be raised and new ballast introduced under them so as to bring them up to level. In order to save hand labor and insure the perfect filling of all cavities a pneumatic tamper is sometimes used. The ballast, consisting of sand or gravel up to \u00be inch in diameter, is fed out of a hopper and meets a blast of air that hurls it into place like shot from an air rifle. This furnishes a very solid and compact road bed.\n\nIt is in much the same way that weather-stained stone walls are cleansed by means of a sand blast. The sand particles projected by the jet of air act[136] like myriads of tiny bullets which chip away the face of the stone.\n\nLAYING CEMENT WITH AN AIRGUN\nIt is after this same fashion that the cement gun is used to project cement against wire reenforcement to form walls of buildings. Carl E. Akeley was led to the invention of the cement gun by his efforts to find an expeditious and economical method of mounting specimens of large animals for the Field Museum in Chicago. He constructed a pneumatic device for spraying cement and water upon a canvas-covered framework, thus building up a body upon which the skin of the animal could be mounted. This machine was improved and tried out successfully, on a large scale, in constructing buildings.\n\nThe machine as now constructed consists of a hopper into which a proper mix of sand and cement is introduced. Compressed air blows this mixture out of a nozzle. Here it meets a jet of water also propelled by compressed air. The water, sand, and cement combine and strike the wall or surface to be coated with such an impact as to make a compact fine-grained coating known to the trade as \u201cgunite.\u201d\n\nLarge surfaces can be painted much more readily and more evenly with compressed air than with a brush. A widely spreading air jet is used which draws the paint out of a receptacle, breaking it up into minute droplets that are projected as a mist against the surface, covering it with a uniform coating.\n\nAIR AS A TENSION SPRING\nSo far we have been considering air as a compression spring. It may also be employed in a manner somewhat analogous to a tension spring. When[137] air is exhausted from a receptacle we have a partial vacuum which will produce work, but in the opposite direction from that produced by compressed air. Of course there is no such thing as suction, and it is the pressure of the atmosphere which is employed to do the work.\n\nWe are apt to overlook the fact that a vacuum cleaner depends upon atmospheric pressure to drag the dust and dirt out of a carpet. A vacuum cleaner would not work on the moon, where there is no atmospheric pressure. The apparatus consists of an air pump, usually driven by an electric motor, which exhausts, or partially exhausts, the air from a foot piece that is dragged along the carpet. As the air under atmospheric pressure rushes in through the carpet to take the place of the air that has been pumped out, it carries with it all loose particles of dirt. The dirt is filtered out of the air or a mechanical trap is provided to catch and retain the dirt while the air is allowed to escape. Large-scale vacuum cleaners are used for cleaning city streets. The dirt is loosened by revolving brushes and is then drawn up by atmospheric pressure into a tank.\n\nAnother use of atmospheric pressure is to be found in the pneumatic tubes which convey mail from one post office to another. Air is exhausted from the tube and when a carrier is inserted which fits the tube closely the atmospheric pressure behind it forces the carrier along to its destination. The same system is used to carry money to and from the cashier\u2019s office in department stores.\n\nIn later developments of the pneumatic mail carrier compressed air was used back of the carrier, but the principle of operation was not altered. In[138] either case propulsion is effected by the difference of air pressure on the opposite sides of the car.\n\nIn 1869 Alfred E. Beach built an experimental subway line under Broadway, New York, near Warren Street. The line was only 200 feet long. A cylindrical car large enough to hold eighteen people, fitted the bore snugly and was propelled in one direction by compressing the air in the tunnel and in the other direction by exhausting the air.\n\n[139]\n\nCHAPTER IX\nPOWER FROM HEAT\n\nTHE TERM \u201cwater power\u201d is a misnomer. There is no power inherent in water. It is gravity that makes water fall in cataracts or flow down a river bed, and hence it is the force of gravity that is responsible for the turning of our turbines and Pelton wheels. Water is merely the medium through which the force of gravity acts.\n\nIn the steam engine, water, again, serves as a medium and it is the energy of heat that is actually the working force. A closed vessel is partly filled with water and heat is applied to it. The water grows hotter and hotter until at a temperature of 212 degrees it begins to vaporize. The temperature of the water remains stationary until the space above the water is completely filled with steam at a pressure equal to that of normal air pressure. The steam gauge then registers zero. Continued application of heat raises the pressure of the steam and also raises the temperature of the water. When the steam gauge shows a pressure of 25 pounds per square inch, the water temperature is nearly 267 degrees; at 100 pounds it is over 337 degrees; at 200 pounds it is 387 degrees; at 500 pounds it is about 467 degrees. As steam is drawn off from the boiler a proportionate amount of water turns immediately into steam to take its place. If the boiler should burst, the entire mass of water would instantly flash into steam because its temperature is far above the boiling point[140] at normal air pressure. That is why the explosion of a steam boiler is so violent. If the boiler were entirely filled with steam the effect of an explosion would not begin to be so destructive as if the boiler were half full of water. It is really the explosion of water that does such serious damage.\n\nWhen the steam pressure in a boiler corresponds to the temperature of the water it is said to be saturated. The water in a boiler boils violently when the steam is drawn off rapidly and tiny droplets of water are carried off in the steam, producing what is known as wet steam. Steam that carries no water particles in suspension is called dry steam. When the steam is heated above the temperature of the water by means of an auxiliary heating device or by some peculiar construction of the boiler, it is called superheated steam.\n\nIn order to economize fuel it is highly important that as much water surface be exposed to the heat as possible. This may be done either by passing the heat in tubes through the water or by passing the water in tubes through the fire. Locomotive boilers are of the fire-tube type. The flaming gases of the furnace pass through the boiler through a series of tubes that lead to the stack. In the water-tube boilers it is highly important that a good and rapid circulation of water be maintained, otherwise there might be local generation of steam with serious consequences.\n\nTHE GIFFARD INJECTOR\n[141]\n\n\nFIG. 45.\u2014INJECTOR FOR INTRODUCING WATER INTO A STEAM BOILER\n\nAs steam is used from a boiler the water is slowly exhausted and it must be replenished with a fresh supply. In early days of the steam engine, water was pumped in against the boiler pressure by the use of powerful pumps, but in 1858 a man named Giffard invented a most ingenious apparatus by which steam of the boiler was used to force water in directly against its own pressure. This seems like lifting oneself by one\u2019s boot straps. When the injector was first invented it seemed so impossible for it to work that engineers would not accept it until it had repeatedly demonstrated its operativeness. Even after it was accepted and in common use its mysterious operation was a subject of discussion for years. A sectional view of a Giffard injector is shown in Figure 45. Steam from the boiler comes down the tube A and passes out in a jet from the nozzle B. A needle valve C may be moved into the nozzle to reduce or shut off the jet of steam. The jet enters a conical chamber D which has a tube E that runs down into the water reservoir. The steam jet blows the air out of chamber D, producing a partial vacuum which draws water up the tube E and into the chamber D. When the water reaches the steam jet it is driven out of the chamber across a short open space into a slightly diverging tube or receiving cone F and through a check valve G into the boiler. At H there is a glass window through[142] which the action of the water jet as it rushes into the receiving tube may be watched. I is an overflow pipe leading back to the reservoir. When the steam flows into the cone B it gathers momentum and issues from the nozzle in a jet of high velocity. On striking the water it combines with the water and condenses, but at the same time it imparts its momentum to the water so that the water is given more than enough momentum to drive it into the boiler against the pressure in the boiler.\n\nThe pressure of steam is utilized to drive the piston of an engine or the steam may be set in motion by letting it issue from a nozzle, when its momentum may be employed to drive a steam turbine in the same way that a water jet drives a Pelton wheel but in either case it is heat that does the work. The steam expands as it moves the piston and as it passes through the nozzle its expansion is accompanied by a corresponding loss of heat.\n\nAs we have already noted, it was for the purpose of raising water that inanimate powers were first set to work. It was with the same object in view that steam was first employed.\n\nHERO\u2019S STEAM ENGINE\nTo be sure the first steam engine was invented by Hero, the disciple of Ctesibius, in the second century before Christ, and it was not a water-raising machine. It consisted of a hollow sphere (see Figure 46), mounted to rotate and fed with steam that entered it through the journals. The steam issued from opposite sides of the sphere through two bent tubes. The steam in issuing from the tubes reacted against the tubes, pushing them back and causing the sphere to revolve.\n\n[143]\n\nEvery action is accompanied by an equal and opposite reaction. A bullet fired from a gun kicks the gun back. In order to push the bullet out of the barrel, the powder must have something to push against and the push against the gun is equal to the push against the bullet. Even if there were no bullet to be pushed the discharge of the powder would react against the gun. In order to push its own gases out of the gun, the powder must push back against the gun.\n\n\nFIG. 46.\u2014HERO\u2019S STEAM ENGINE\n\nIn Hero\u2019s engine, the steam, in order to push itself out of the sphere, must push against the bent tubes. We have a similar reaction motor in the revolving lawn sprinkler. The water issuing from the bent arms of the sprinkler forces them back and causes them to revolve. Were the arms radial and not bent the reaction would be there just the same, but it would be exerted against the center of the wheel and hence there would be no rotation.\n\nReaction has nothing to do with the pressure of the atmosphere as so many people imagine. A gun would kick just as hard and the lawn sprinkler or Hero\u2019s engine would operate just as well and as fast[144] in a perfect vacuum. It was to demonstrate the principle of reaction that Hero built his steam engine. As far as we know it was never put to useful work and remained merely a scientific toy.\n\nNEWCOMEN\u2019S ATMOSPHERIC ENGINE\nThe first practical use of steam power was applied to the pumping of water from the deep mines of Cornwall. Newcomen\u2019s engine, which antedated Watt\u2019s by several decades, was known as an atmospheric engine. It consisted of a cylinder fitted with a piston, but the top of the cylinder was open. The piston was connected to one end of a lever or walking beam, the other end of which was connected by a chain with the plunger of a pump situated at the bottom of the mine shaft. Little power was required to lift the piston because it was counterbalanced by the chain and plunger attached to the opposite end of the walking beam. The real work was done in pushing the piston down and thereby raising the pump plunger. Steam under low pressure was let into the cylinder under the piston to raise it and then a jet of water was sprayed into the steam-filled cylinder. This condensed the steam, producing vacuum and the atmospheric pressure acting on the upper surface of the piston forced the piston down, raising the pump plunger. The engine ran very slowly, making only about 15 strokes per minute. Later it was improved, producing about 30 strokes per minute.\n\nWATT\u2019S STEAM ENGINE\nWatt was the first man to build an engine in which the real work was done by the pressure of steam as in modern steam engines. As long as the steam engine[145] was used for pumping water the reciprocating piston could be connected directly to the pump plunger and it was unnecessary to exert power on both sides of the piston, but in 1782 Watt obtained a patent on a double-acting engine. Steam was admitted first on one side of the piston and then on the other. The walking beam was connected by means of a connecting rod to a crank on a shaft that carried a flywheel, and the seesaw motion of the beam was converted into rotary motion of the wheel. This opened up new industrial opportunities for the steam engine.\n\nThe steam was exhausted from the cylinder into a condenser, i.e., a chamber, in which a spray of water converted the steam into water, producing a vacuum, thereby relieving the piston of back pressure and virtually adding that much more power to the steam operating on the opposite side of the piston. A pump driven by the engine drew the water and the air liberated from the condensed steam out of the condenser.\n\nWatt invented an ingenious governor to control the flow of steam to the engine and insure a uniform motion. (See Figure 47.) This governor consisted of a pair of levers hinged to a revolving shaft and each provided with a ball weight at its free end. The shaft was revolved by the engine and if the engine tended to run too fast the balls were thrown out by centrifugal action. In so doing they operated a throttle valve cutting down the steam supply. When the engine slowed down the balls would drop, admitting more steam. In this way the speed of the engine was kept within close limits. The ball governor in improved form is still widely used in stationary engines.\n\n[146]\n\nUSING THE HEAT IN THE STEAM\n\nFIG. 47.\u2014WATT\u2019S BALL GOVERNOR\n\nAnother of Watt\u2019s inventions which has proved of highest importance in steam engineering was the cut off. In his first engine the piston was subjected to the full boiler pressure throughout its stroke, and the steam that poured out of the exhaust port of the cylinder at the end of the piston stroke was almost as hot as that which entered the cylinder at the beginning of the stroke. The heat that goes out in the exhaust represents just so much wasted energy. Watt realized this and so he invented a valve which would cut off the flow from the boiler before the piston had completed its stroke. Then the steam back of the piston would continue to expand because of the heat within it and would keep on pushing the piston. Of course, the pressure would gradually diminish and there would be less power in the stroke than if the full boiler pressure were pushing the piston all the way, but this loss of power is[147] offset by the saving in steam and in the fuel used to heat the steam. The point at which the cut-off takes place depends largely upon the pressure of the steam. If the steam is cut off when the piston has made only one-fifth of its stroke, one-fifth as much steam will be used at each stroke as would be the case if the steam were used nonexpansively. However, in actual practice the expansion of the cut-off steam instead of being five times would be only about four times, because of the clearance that must be allowed between the piston and the end of the cylinder. If steam of 100 pounds absolute pressure is used, the average pressure throughout the piston will be only about 57 per cent of the full pressure of the steam in the boiler, but each pound of steam will actually do .57 \u00d7 4 = 2.28 times as much work as it would if used nonexpansively. All sorts of valve gear have been invented to admit steam quickly and cut it off at the proper point to produce the most efficient result.\n\nIn low-pressure cylinders in order to prevent loss of heat through the wall of the cylinder, the latter is steam-jacketed. In other words, there is an outer casing surrounding the cylinder and between this casing and the cylinder steam is admitted to keep the cylinder walls hot.\n\nIn order to make full use of the heat in steam it is, in some engines, sent through a series of two, three, and even four cylinders. The exhaust from one cylinder goes into a second larger cylinder. From here after doing work on a piston it discharges into a third still larger cylinder and from that may be led into a fourth cylinder. The cylinders must be progressively larger to allow for the expansion of the steam.\n\n[148]\n\nThe ordinary steam engine labors under the disadvantage of having to start and stop its pistons at the end of each stroke. Every body possesses inertia, whether it be moving or at rest. If it be at rest, it takes much more energy to set it in motion than to keep it moving. In fact it would keep on moving without further expenditure of energy were there no friction and no forces acting against it. In order to stop the body energy must be expended to overcome its inertia. The more rapidly a body is started and the more quickly it is stopped, the more work must be done in overcoming its inertia. In a steam engine not only the piston but other parts connected to it may be required to reciprocate several hundred times per minute. A great deal of energy is uselessly expended in starting and stopping these parts.\n\nMany efforts have been made to produce a rotary engine in which the piston rotates instead of reciprocating, thus doing away with the work of overcoming inertia. However, there are serious obstacles to the construction of such an engine, and as yet no truly efficient and practical rotary engine has been built.\n\nDE LAVAL\u2019S STEAM TURBINE\nHowever, there is another type of engine in which the steam is applied continuously and all the parts revolve. Such an engine was the reaction turbine invented by Hero, to which reference has already been made. Modern turbines, however, are of very different construction. They resemble the Pelton wheels and turbines used in developing water power, differing from them mainly in the fact that use is made of the expansive energy of steam which is lacking in water. In the De Laval steam turbine a[149] wheel is used which has a series of curved buckets all around its periphery that are closed at the outer end by a circular rim. (See Figure 48.) Steam is directed against this bucket, not tangentially as in a Pelton wheel, but from the side. Several steam nozzles are employed and as the steam jets strike the buckets and sweep around their curved surfaces they react against the buckets and drive the wheel around. In order to operate efficiently the velocity of the steam must be very high and the wheel must also turn at high speed. When steam flows through a diverging nozzle its velocity is greatly accelerated by its expansive effort. Such nozzles are used in the De Laval turbines and the steam issues from them with a velocity which may be higher than that of a rifle bullet. The buckets are forged and the hard-scale surface is left on them; otherwise they would wear away quickly under the action of the powerful jets of steam.\n\n\nFIG. 48.\u2014THE DE LAVAL STEAM TURBINE\n\nThe turbine wheel may revolve at a speed of 30,000 revolutions per minute. Such a tremendous[150] speed has its disadvantages. If a wheel is to run smoothly it must revolve on its center of gravity. A lopsided wheel, or one that is mounted a little off center, produces a pounding action which imposes a serious strain upon the bearings and the revolving parts. The wheel tries to turn on its own center of gravity and will do so if permitted to. It is impossible to balance a wheel so perfectly that the axis it turns on passes exactly through its center of gravity. At ordinary speeds this slight eccentricity is so slight that it is practically negligible, but when we have to deal with 30,000 revolutions per minute the least divergence between the center of rotation and the center of gravity will produce dangerous strains. For this reason the wheel of the De Laval turbine is mounted on a flexible shaft and on floating bearings, so that it will automatically find and turn on its own center of gravity. In order to utilize the power developed in the wheel, gearing must be used to step down the speed.\n\nPARSONS EXPANSION TURBINE\nThe Parsons steam turbine resembles a water turbine in its action. Instead of having a few nozzles directing steam against the buckets there is a nozzle for each bucket, and instead of a single wheel there is a series of them through which the steam passes, successively passing through a set of nozzles between each wheel. The nozzles are formed of blades on the periphery of stationary wheels. These blades are curved in the opposite direction to the blades on the revolving wheels, as shown in Figure 49. Steam in passing through the ring of curved stationary blades is divided up into a series of jets which strike the curved blades of the first wheel. In passing[151] through this wheel the direction of the stream is reversed, and it enters between the second set of stationary blades, which turn it back again and direct it against the next wheel. Thus the steam pursues a sinuous course through the series of wheels. To allow for the expansion of the steam the blades are made progressively longer and the wheels of progressively larger diameter from the inlet to the exhaust end of the engine.\n\n\nFIG. 49.\u2014PERIPHERAL VIEW OF THE BLADES OF A PARSONS TURBINE\n\nThe Curtis turbine combines the De Laval and the Parsons principles. The steam enters through a series of nozzles which are of the expanding type, then it goes through a series of moving and stationary blades, as in the Parsons turbine, from which it enters another set of expanding nozzles and gains velocity and momentum before passing through the second series or stage of moving and fixed blades. (See Figure 50.)\n\nSteam turbines are particularly adapted for use in electric power plants. The speed of rotation of the Parsons and Curtis types is much lower than that of the De Laval and hence the electric generators may be directly driven by them without the interposition of any gearing. They can be built of larger power than the reciprocating engines because they are so economical of space.\n\n[152]\n\n\nFIG. 50.\u2014PERIPHERAL VIEW OF THE BLADES AND NOZZLES OF A CURTIS TURBINE\n\nA good comparison of turbine versus reciprocating engines is offered by the 74th Street power station of the Manhattan Elevated Railway, New York. This station, which was completed in 1901, was equipped with eight huge reciprocating engines, each developing 8,000 horsepower normally, and capable of delivering a maximum of 12,500 horsepower. The whole plant, therefore, had a maximum capacity of 100,000 horsepower. Gradually these[153] units have been giving way to steam turbines of much higher power, and in 1919 there was installed one powerful turbine which alone was capable of developing as much power as the entire plant of 1901. This is a triple-compound turbine comprising one high-pressure turbine and a low-pressure turbine at each side. Steam enters the high-pressure turbine at 205 pounds pressure to the square inch and then exhausts into the low-pressure turbines, passing from them into condensers which operate under 29 inches vacuum. Each turbine drives a separate generator and the combined horsepower of the whole unit is about 100,000, while the floor space occupied is only 50 by 52 feet.\n\nThe economy of space and of fuel offered by the steam turbine is of great value in the power plants of ships, and this form of prime mover has been installed on modern high-speed passenger liners and also on high-speed war vessels. While in certain respects the turbine is ideal for such service, there are two handicaps which must be overcome. In the first place, the most efficient speed for the turbine is considerably higher than the efficient speed of the propeller and some means must be provided for stepping down the speed. In the second place, the turbine cannot be as economically controlled as a reciprocating engine and its direction of rotation cannot be reversed, so that difficulties are encountered in maneuvering the ship in harbors. It is no simple matter to gear down the high speed and enormous power of a turbine, However, an elaborate system of gearing has been provided for this purpose which has proved satisfactory even in powerful battle cruisers. The British battle cruisers with a power plant of 134,000 horsepower are driven by[154] geared turbines. To reverse the propellers separate low-power turbines are used.\n\nA more attractive system of control is to have the turbines drive electric generators and then use the electric power to drive the propellers through motors mounted on the propeller shafts. The electric power can easily be controlled from the bridge and the propellers may be reversed by reversing the motors. However, the disadvantage of the electric system is that it occupies a great deal of space, particularly in plants running over 100,000 horsepower.\n\n[155]\n\nCHAPTER X\nBURNING FUEL IN THE ENGINE CYLINDER\n\nONE OF the handicaps of steam power is that the heat produced by the combustion of fuel is not used directly to drive the piston. A large part of the heat energy in coal goes up the chimney or is wasted by radiation from the furnace walls. With anthracite coal in the furnace the loss may be as low as 22 per cent in the very best types of boilers. In the engine other serious losses occur, so that in the best condensing reciprocating steam engines the power delivered is only 10 to 16 per cent of that stored in the fuel. In locomotives the efficiency is as low as 4 to 6 per cent. In turbines the steam is used to better advantage and the actual power delivered may run up to 20 per cent of that in the fuel.\n\nIn internal-combustion engines the furnace and boiler losses are largely overcome by burning the fuel right in the cylinder, where the heat energy of the combustion may be utilized directly upon the piston. There are other losses, however, so that the most efficient gasoline engines deliver only 28 per cent of the energy in the fuel, and coal-gas engines may run up to 31 per cent.\n\nA wide range of fuels may be used in an internal-combustion engine. They may be either gaseous, liquid, or even solid. In stationary engines hydrogen, coal gas, natural gas, blast-furnace gas, and[156] producer gas are employed to advantage. Volatile fuels, such as alcohol, bensol, gasoline, and kerosene, are turned into a mist or vapor and then burned as a gas. In engines of the Diesel type any liquid fuel ranging down to thick crude oils may be employed, and in one type of engine, which, however, has not proved commercially practicable, coal dust is burned in the cylinder.\n\nBURNING AIR IN THE AUTOMOBILE ENGINE\nOwing to the widespread use of automobiles, the general public is better acquainted with internal-combustion engines than with steam engines. Nevertheless, there are many elementary facts in connection with gasoline engines that are not generally known. The average motorist probably does not realize that he burns far more air in his motor than gasoline, and he probably does not understand why it is that the mixture of gasoline vapor and air must be compressed before it is ignited, or why only one out of four strokes of the piston is a power stroke.\n\nIf a volume of gasoline vapor be thoroughly mixed with an equal volume of air, the mixture will not explode. Only when there is an excess of air will combustion take place, and the most intensive explosion takes place when there are nine parts of air to one part of gasoline vapor. Where gasoline is vaporized in a carburetor the best mixture is one part of gasoline-saturated air to eight parts of pure air. Hence it is mainly air that is burned in an automobile engine.\n\nThe energy of combustion is much greater when the mixture is compressed. The particles of gasoline and air are forced into more intimate contact by the compression. The same thing is true of gunpowder.[157] If gunpowder is ignited in the open air, it will burn quickly, but not with explosive violence. If, on the other hand, the powder is compressed in a cartridge and is then ignited, an explosion takes place. Nearly twice as much gas was required in the early noncompression-type motors as is required to-day in the compression motors of the same power.\n\nIn an internal-combustion engine the cylinder serves as a furnace. This \u201cfurnace\u201d must be charged with fuel, and after the fuel has been burned the \u201cashes\u201d\u2014i. e., the products of combustion\u2014must be removed. The piston serves as the furnace stoker.\n\nIn the ordinary four-cycle engine the action of the piston is as follows: On the first or down stroke of the piston a mixture of air and gasoline vapor is drawn into the cylinder; on the next or rising stroke the charge is compressed. Then the charge is ignited by an electric spark, and the rapid combustion of the charge produces gases which drive the piston down. On the fourth stroke the piston rises again and pushes the burnt gases out of the cylinder. The piston receives energy intermittently, or only once out of four strokes, and a flywheel has to keep it going the rest of the time. It is just like propelling a bicycle with a single pedal and pushing the pedal every other time it comes out. It can be done as long as the wheel is moving fast enough to carry itself along between power strokes. Naturally a single-cylinder motor cannot be slowed down very much without stalling, and it will not start of itself because it needs outside help in stoking its furnace before it acquires the power to do this job alone.\n\n[158]\n\n\nFIG. 51\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A TWO-CYCLE ENGINE\n\nThere is a two-cycle type of motor in which the burnt gases are removed from the cylinder, not by the piston, but by the injection of the unburnt fuel mixture. On the upward or compression stroke the piston not only compresses the mixture in the cylinder, but draws in a fresh charge of fuel into the crank case, and when the piston is driven down by the combustion of the fuel in the cylinder, the charge in the crank case is compressed until, near the end of its stroke, the piston uncovers a port in the cylinder through which the fuel from the crank case is forced in. (See Figure 51.) Just before this occurs the piston uncovers an exhaust port in the opposite side of the cylinder, and the burnt gases start to[159] flow out before the fresh charge of fuel pours into the cylinder. The incoming gas is directed upward so as to completely scavenge the cylinder of all burnt gases.\n\nThere are no bothersome poppet valves in this engine. The piston itself acts as a valve, opening and closing the inlet and exhaust ports as it slides by them. Every other stroke of the piston is a power stroke, so that the engine acts like a one-pedal bicycle, which receives a push every time the pedal comes around. Unfortunately, the burnt gases are never completely scavenged, and the fresh charge of fuel is always more or less diluted by the product of combustion remaining from the previous charge. This represents just so much loss of power, and may interfere with the ignition of the charge. For this reason the four-cycle engine is generally considered more reliable and efficient, and is far more generally used, particularly on motor vehicles.\n\nTo overcome the intermittent character of the internal combustion engine a number of cylinders are used, which come into play successively. In the four-cylinder motor one piston is always on the power stroke. In recent years the number of cylinders has progressively increased from four to six, eight, and twelve cylinders, while in racing power boats the number of cylinders has gone up as high as twenty-four.\n\nCOOLING THE CYLINDERS\nThe temperature of the combustion in a gasoline engine may be over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Evidently it would melt the cylinder walls were not special provisions taken to keep them cool. The usual method is to surround the cylinders with[160] water which absorbs the heat, and then cool the water by passing it through a radiator. Air driven by a fan through the radiator carries off the heat. Of course this represents just so much wasted energy and lowers the efficiency of the motor, but it is the most convenient way of getting rid of the intense heat of combustion. Smaller motors, such as are used on motorcycles, have their cylinders cooled by direct action of air on the outer surface of the cylinder. The heat radiated depends upon the surface exposed and the velocity of the air current. The radiating surface of the cylinders is increased by forming them with external ribs or flanges, so that the air that flows over them, while the machine is in motion, carries off enough heat to keep the temperature of the cylinders within safe limits. In some systems, particularly in the case of stationary engines, to insure a good circulation, the air is positively driven against the flanges by means of a fan.\n\nThere are serious disadvantages in using water to cool an engine. Besides the bother of keeping the water system supplied with water there is the danger of clogging the radiator with lime deposits, and in extremely cold weather the water is liable to freeze and burst the water jackets or the radiator; for this reason, air cooling is recommended by some for automobile engines. In certain air-cooled automobile engines the cylinders are air-jacketed; that is, they are surrounded with casings through which the air is sucked by a powerful fan driven by the engine shaft, so that the air is bound to flow if the engine is turning. The cylinders are ribbed, so that they present a large radiating surface.\n\n\nCopyright, Kadel & Herbert\n\nGIANT CAPRONI HYDROAEROPLANE WHICH WAS WRECKED AT LAGO MAGGIORE\n\nSeating capacity 100 persons; power, eight 450-h.p.

But the fuel is used more efficiently because less of its heat energy is wasted; so that air-cooled engines show a slight fuel economy over water-cooled engines. On the other hand, when the air-cooled engine is overloaded or is run at very high speeds it is liable to become overheated and may ignite the incoming charge of gas prematurely.\n\nTHE SELF IGNITING DIESEL ENGINE\nAs has already been pointed out, compression of gas generates heat, and one of the reasons for cooling the cylinders of an internal combustion engine is to prevent the gas from exploding prematurely on the compression stroke of the piston. In the Diesel engine, instead of avoiding such a critical temperature it is deliberately sought, because it is the heat of compression, instead of an electric spark, which ignites the charge. Pure air is drawn into the cylinder on the suction stroke. This air is under ordinary atmospheric pressure when it enters, but on the return stroke of the piston it is compressed to about 500 pounds per square inch. This raises the temperature up to the neighborhood of 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. Into this highly heated air a spray of oil is injected by air at still higher pressure and immediately the oil flashes into flame and the gases resulting from the combustion drive the piston down.\n\nThis is a very economical type of motor. Any liquid fuel may be used, from light gasoline to heavy crude oils, or the oils that remain after the more volatile fuels have been distilled from them.[162] The heavy oils have more heat value in them than is to be found in light volatile fuels, such as alcohol, gasoline, and kerosene, and because the oils do not throw off any inflammable vapors unless highly heated, they can be stored more safely. This is of highest importance on submarines and Diesel engines are commonly used for propulsion on the surface or to drive the generators which charge the storage batteries for submerged travel.\n\nIn order to inject the fuel into the cylinder against the pressure of air therein, a powerful air pump is required. This does not need to be of very large capacity, but it must compress the air to from 700 to 1,000 pounds per square inch. It may seem at first as if the work done by the engine in compressing the air in the cylinder and in operating the injector pump represents so much loss, but a moment\u2019s consideration will show that it is all recovered. The air in the cylinder acts like a spring, rebounding when the piston starts down on its power stroke and adding its energy to that of the burning gases, while the air from the injector pump also enters the cylinder and helps to push the piston down.\n\nDiesel engines are made to operate on the two-cycle as well as the four-cycle principle.\n\nIn one type of engine, known as the semi-Diesel, a lower compression is used in the cylinder. This is not high enough to ignite the oil that is sprayed in, and so a hot tube or bulb is employed at the top of the cylinder against which the fuel jet is directed. This bulb is heated to a dark cherry red by means of a torch until the engine has developed enough heat to keep the bulb at the requisite temperature.\n\n[163]\n\nTHE DOUBLE-ACTING JUNKER ENGINE\n\nFIG. 52.\u2014THE JUNKER ENGINE IN WHICH TWO PISTONS RECIPROCATE TOWARD AND AWAY FROM EACH OTHER\n\nAn interesting modification of the Diesel engine is the Junker engine (Figure 52) in which the cylinder consists of a tube open at each end. In this there are two pistons which reciprocate toward and away from each other. Air is compressed between them as they approach each other and fuel is[164] injected into this air, ignites and forces them apart. Both pistons are connected to the same crank shaft, one pushing down and the other pulling up. The pulling piston has a yoke on the end of the piston rod from which a pair of connecting rods run down at either side of the cylinder to a pair of cranks on the crank shaft. Between these cranks on the opposite side of the shaft is the crank to which the pushing piston is connected. The advantages of this arrangement are that the moving masses are perfectly balanced, the construction of the cylinder is very simple and especially adapted to high pressures, and the reaction of the gases, instead of being directed against a fixed part of the engine, is directed against a moving piston, thus reducing the strain on the structure. Of course the power is not doubled or increased, because each piston moves only half as far as it would for a given expansion of gas were it operating in a cylinder closed by a cylinder head.\n\nThe efficiency of Diesel engines, although greater than that of the gas and gasoline engines, is still very low. The semi-Diesel will yield about 30 per cent of the energy in the fuel, the Junker engine about 34 per cent, and the best Diesel, four-cycle engine in large units, about 36 per cent. This is a wonderfully high efficiency compared with that of a locomotive, and yet it seems pitiably low when we consider that nearly two-thirds of the energy stored in the fuel is thrown away.\n\nSILENCING THE NOISY EXHAUST\nThe waste of energy is clearly evident in the exhaust pipe of an internal combustion engine. The gases after doing their work on the piston rush out[165] with such velocity as to produce a sharp explosive sound. The noise of the exhaust is highly objectionable in automobiles and must be overcome, but instead of utilizing the boisterous energy of the escaping gases and getting a little more useful work out of them, means are provided for hushing their noise. This is done by passing them through a series of baffles which reduces the pressure of the gases before they are discharged into the atmosphere. By letting the gases expand gradually instead of bursting suddenly into the atmosphere the noise of the discharge is reduced. However, this must not be done at the expense of the engine power. Unless the gases pass quickly through the muffler they will choke and retard the exhaust and make the engine do useless work in driving them through. Even the best of mufflers will use up nearly 5 per cent of the engine power. The energy that escapes at the exhaust is not the only loss. All the heat that radiates from the engine represents just so much wasted energy. In our water and air-cooled systems we deliberately abstract heat from the burning gases and throw it away. If we had materials that would stand the intense heat of burning gases and enable us to conserve all the heat developed in the cylinder we could use our fuels much more economically.\n\nMany attempts have been made to utilize the wasted heat of internal combustion engines, but they have not met with any considerable degree of success, with the exception of the invention of William Joseph Still. This engine, which was the result of many years of patient work, was first made public in a paper read before the Royal Society of Arts in London, May 26, 1919, and when it was shown[166] that the new engine had developed an efficiency of 38 to 41 per cent it was realized that here was a remarkable advance over any other machine for turning heat into power.\n\nCOMBINED STEAM AND OIL ENGINE\nThe Still engine is a combined steam and gas or oil engine. The heat that is ordinarily thrown away in the water jacket and in the exhaust is utilized to produce steam, and this steam is employed to return the piston to the top of the cylinder after the gases generated by the combustion of fuel have driven it down. While in previous experiments some steam had been developed from the exhaust gases it had not been found possible to generate steam in the water jacket because of the low temperature that had to be maintained. In the standard internal combustion engine the cylinder walls are made of cast iron, thick enough to withstand the heavy pressures to which they are subjected should the charge be ignited prematurely. Around them the water circulates under practically no pressure and so the wall of the water jacket is made comparatively thin. Because of the thickness of the cylinder wall the water has to be maintained at a comparatively low temperature so as to keep the interior of the cylinder from growing too hot. In the Still engine the cylinder wall is from one-third to one-fourth the thickness of the standard cylinder wall, while the water-jacket wall is of thick steel. The cylinder wall is formed with ribs which extend to the water-jacket wall, so that the latter will take care of any excessive loads due to premature ignition. Figure 53 shows how the cylinder and jacket of the Still engine compare with those of the ordinary motor. The[167] thin cylinder wall and the ribs furnish a far better conduction of heat to the water which circulates between the ribs. The necessary cooling of the cylinder can be maintained with water at a much higher temperature than in the ordinary engine.\n\n\nFIG. 53.\u2014SECTION THROUGH THE CYLINDER AND WATER JACKET OF THE STILL ENGINE\n\n[168]\n\n\nFIG. 54.\u2014DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF THE STILL ENGINE\n\nA diagrammatic representation of a Still engine of the two-cycle heavy-oil type is shown in Figure 54. This is shown with an auxiliary boiler heated by an oil burner. The piston of this engine has a sleeve which fits into an annular steam cylinder. The latter is an extension of the combustion cylinder. Surrounding the steam and combustion cylinders are the steam and water jackets. The drawing shows the piston at the end of its downward stroke, having just been driven down by the gases of combustion. In this position a scavenging-air port at the left is uncovered and the burnt gases are swept out by a blast of air, passing out of the exhaust. This consists of a bank of tubes or flues which pass through a water heater. The gases leave the cylinder with a temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit and they issue from the exhaust with a final temperature of only 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Steam now enters the annular steam cylinder from the steam jacket, through the port shown at the lower right-hand side, forcing the piston up and compressing the charge of air in the cylinder. Then oil is sprayed in through a nozzle, not shown in the drawing, and is ignited by the heat of the compressed air as in a Diesel engine and the piston is driven down again by the gases of the combustion. The water surrounding the combustion cylinder comes from the lower part of the boiler and flows by the exhaust flues. It is maintained at a temperature of 350 degrees in the water jacket, and here is turned[169] into steam by the heat of the combustion. Thence it passes into the steam dome of the boiler. On the downward stroke of the piston a slide valve, shown at the lower right-hand side, moves down and connects the steam port with an exhaust port through which the steam flows out into a condenser. Water from the hot well of the condenser enters the system at the combustion exhaust. The arrows show the course of the steam and water and the temperature at various points is given. As may be noted there are two systems of steam and water circulation: one from the bottom of the boiler through combustion exhaust heater to the water jacket and back to the top of the boiler; and the other from the steam dome of the boiler to the steam jacket, to the steam cylinder, to the steam exhaust, to the condenser and back again from the condenser into the combustion exhaust heater, whence it enters the boiler by way of the water jacket.\n\nLATENT HEAT\nWhen water turns into steam a certain amount of heat is absorbed, which does not show in the thermometer. This is known as latent heat. If cold water is placed in a kettle and is then heated the thermometer will gradually rise until the water reaches the boiling point. Then there will be no further rise of temperature, although heat is still applied to the kettle, until all the water is turned into steam, after which the thermometer will begin to show a rise of temperature, showing that the steam is beginning to grow sensibly hotter. In the engine, shown in Figure 54, a boiler pressure of 120 pounds gauge pressure is maintained, and therefore water will not boil until it reaches 350 degrees Fahrenheit.[170] The water in the water jacket registers 350 degrees and is therefore far hotter than it could possibly be in the open atmosphere. However, the heat from the combustion does not raise the temperature of the water, but expends its energy in converting the water into steam. The cylinder wall is kept at a temperature of at least 350 degrees all the time, so that the air that enters the cylinder gathers heat from the cylinder as well as from its own compression, and its temperature at the end of the compression stroke is higher than it would be in a cold cylinder, thereby insuring the ignition of the fuel when it is sprayed in.\n\nThe Still engine can also be used as a common gasoline or gas engine of either two or four cycle and the efficiency in such types is from 31 to 33 per cent. This is much better than the best airplane engines, which show an efficiency under 27 per cent. Although 41 per cent for the best Still heavy-oil engine is a remarkable accomplishment, yet it does not begin to compare with the efficiency of the best water turbines and Pelton wheels, which turn into useful power from 75 to 87 per cent of the kinetic energy in the water that drives them.\n\n[171]\n\nCHAPTER XI\nWHEN COAL AND OIL ARE EXHAUSTED\n\nIN PREVIOUS chapters we have indulged in a great deal of historic retrospect. It may be well at this point, while we are dealing with the subject of power, to look into the future and the prospects that it holds out to us.\n\nIt was about fifty thousand years ago, according to conservative estimates, that primitive man first began to use tools, and he managed to exist and thrive and develop to a very high degree of civilization during practically the whole of that period without touching the stores of energy that lay beneath his feet. It was only yesterday that the steam engine was invented, and when it was discovered how to turn heat into work and what a wealth of power was stored up in the deposits of coal there started a lavish and profligate squandering of the precious heritage of the Carboniferous era. The fossilized vegetation of by-gone ages is now employed to drive our locomotives and steamships, to turn our factory wheels, to extract metals from the ore and help us shape them according to our needs and desires, to convert iron into steel and to heat and light our houses. We all know that there is a limited supply of coal in the world and that some day the stores will be exhausted, yet we go on using larger quantities of the fuel each year.\n\n[172]\n\nFor the last century our demands for coal have been doubling every ten years, until to-day the world is using about 1,200 million long tons per year. It is conservatively estimated that if our demands for coal do not increase there is enough left in the whole world within a mile of the surface to last 1,500 years. Fortunately this country is better supplied than many others, and it is probable that we can get along on our present rations for 2,000 years. England, however, faces exhaustion of her coal supplies within two hundred years.\n\nAfter living fifty millenniums on earth as a being clearly superior to other animals, man comes into an inheritance which he squanders in one or at most two millenniums. It is not creditable to our civilization that we have taken no precautions to ration out this precious store of fuel.\n\nOUR WASTE OF FUEL\nAs was shown in a previous chapter, we utilize very little of the energy in coal. Our steam railroads squander from 94 to 96 per cent of the coal they burn and our best turbine power plants throw away about 80 per cent. The coal we burn in domestic furnaces is most wastefully squandered. Maybe we shall learn how to use the energy in coal more efficiently and make it last longer, but eventually it will all be gone and then what are we going to do?\n\nOf the other fuels available, petroleum takes the leading place, but we are hardly more economical in our use of this fuel and our oil supplies are diminishing much more rapidly than the stores of coal. In 1919 the United States produced 376,000,000 barrels of oil and consumed 418,000,000 barrels,[173] having had to draw on Mexico for 42,000,000 barrels. Natural gas cannot last much longer and peat bogs are estimated at about half of one per cent of the coal supplies. Where shall we turn for heat and power when all these stores of energy are gone?\n\nIt has been estimated that the water powers of the earth, if fully developed, would probably supply about half of the energy that we now get out of coal. This is a never-failing supply of energy, and no doubt before we have begun to scrape the bottom of our coal magazines every river on earth that is capable of turning a wheel will be doing so to the limit of its capacity. Then there will be a readjustment of the manufacturing centers of the earth and remote regions such as Iceland, for instance, which has more available water power than Switzerland, will hum with machinery, while such countries as Great Britain, which is relatively poor in water powers, will have to give up manufacture and revert to agricultural pursuits.\n\nBut are there not other powers that can be used? If we could capture all the energy of the winds we should have ample power to do all the work that is now done on earth with a large margin to spare. It has been estimated that the winds contain 5,000 times as much energy as is obtained from coal, but how may we capture so fickle a power as the wind. It is so variable, sometimes exerting enough power to lift houses from their foundations and uproot giant trees, and again sinking to an absolute calm. In some places wind power is turned into electricity and then stored up in batteries; but the cost of doing this is high and at present uneconomical.\n\n[174]\n\n\u201cBLUE COAL\u201d\nThe ocean Is a vast storehouse of energy. The quiet but powerful rise and fall of ocean tides, and the tremendous energy of ocean waves, have been looked upon with envy by engineers. All sorts of schemes have been devised for capturing a part of this energy and putting it into the service of man. Water power has been aptly called \u201cwhite coal\u201d and ocean power \u201cblue coal.\u201d Wave energy is but another form of wind energy and hence just as fickle. There is plenty of power to be had, but it is a costly matter to build a power plant on the shores of the ocean and any day a storm may arise which will dash the machinery to pieces and sweep away the whole plant or convert it into a pile of wreckage. In a few places, however, Nature has provided a plant which the ocean has been unable to destroy and man has adopted the plant to furnish him with power. There is a rocky cave on the California coast which is exposed to the ocean swells. As the swells sweep into the cave they compress the air therein and this compressed air is trapped in a reservoir. Then the air that has been pumped by the ocean is put to useful work. There are similar caves on other rocky coasts which could be made to deliver power when coal becomes scarce and it becomes commercially practicable to exploit them, but the amount of power they would furnish would be a mere drop in the bucket.\n\nSETTING TIDES TO WORK\nThe ocean tides are also immensely powerful, but the rise and fall of the water is so slight and so gradual in most places that an enormous plant is[175] required to obtain any appreciable amount of power. In certain regions, however, tidal power is actually in use to-day. At high tide water flows into a large basin and at the ebb of the tide the outflow of the basin operates a water wheel or turbine. Power can be obtained while the basin is filling as well as while it is emptying. One serious objection to this plan is that the turbine operates intermittently and at irregular intervals, sometimes by day and sometimes by night, depending upon the tide. However, tide mills need not be exposed to the fury of ocean storms as are plants that seek to employ the power of ocean waves. In certain localities the conformation of the coast is such as to accumulate the tidal flow and produce enormous differences of level between ebb and flood tide. In the Bay of Fundy, for instance, the tide rises seventy feet and an appreciable amount of power could be obtained from the flow of water into and out of the bay. If a sea-level canal were dug across the Isthmus of Panama there would be a flow of water back and forth through it because the tides at the Pacific side have a rise and fall of only two feet while on the Atlantic side the tide rises twenty-two feet. Some power might be obtained from the tidal flow through this canal, but a fall of twenty feet in fifty miles would not produce a very swift current.\n\n[176]\n\n\nFIG. 55.\u2014THE ESNAULT PELTERIE PLAN OF UTILIZING TIDAL POWER IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL\n\nIf tidal power is to be utilized at all it must be done on a grand scale. A French engineer, R. Esnault Pelterie, has proposed a vast tidal power system in the English channel where the tide rises high. (See map Fig. 55.) The plan is a most ambitious one, but the power that could be obtained is enormous. He proposes to build concrete dikes across the channel at the Straits of Calais inclosing a large basin about twenty miles wide and turbines would be operated by the flow of water into and out of this basin. Of course locks would have to be provided to permit the passage of ships through the basin. Other and larger basins could be formed by walling off the estuary of the Thames and the bay of the Seine on the French coast. The Gulf of St. Malo could be inclosed by running a dike from Cape La Hague to the island of Guernsey and thence to the mouth of the Trieux. These basins would furnish a minimum of 800 horsepower for each square mile, hence the basin across the Straits of Calais alone would furnish nearly half a million horsepower while the Gulf of St. Malo would furnish about a quarter of the power that France now uses in her industries. The first cost of the installation would be heavy, but there would be no expense[177] for fuel and the supply of power would be endless. It has been proposed to dam the estuary of the Severn (England) where the spring tides rise thirty feet, and it has been estimated that half a million horsepower would be developed. Part of the power would be used to pump water into an elevated reservoir which would serve as a storage battery, so that when the tidal plant was idle because of the turn of the tide, water flowing out of the reservoir would operate an auxiliary plant, thereby furnishing a continuous supply of power.\n\nPOWER FROM SUNSHINE\nWith the exception of the tides all the energy we use on earth comes from the sun. It is the sun\u2019s energy that is stored in coal beds and oil fields; it is the sun\u2019s energy that raises water from the ocean to the tops of our mountains; it is the sun\u2019s energy that makes the winds blow, and through them disturbs the surface of the ocean, and even the tides owe a part of their energy to the attraction of the sun. Why can we not utilize the energy of the sun directly, instead of at second hand? In the sunshine that beats upon the earth there is seventy-thousand times as much energy as we now obtain from coal. Unfortunately the energy of the sun is so widely dispersed that it cannot be used economically except in a very few places where clouds do not often interrupt the direct passage of the rays to the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nNear Cairo, Egypt, there is a plant erected by an American inventor, Mr. Frank Shuman, which develops about fifty horsepower. This consists of a series of five huge trough-shaped mirrors that focus the sun\u2019s rays upon boilers and thus generate[178] low pressure steam. The mirrors measure 13 feet in width and 304 feet in length and these are mounted on a light steel framework with their axes running north and south so that they may be turned from east to west to follow the course of the sun across the sky. In order to prevent the mirrors from shading each other in the early morning and late afternoon they are set twenty-five feet apart. Mirrors are made of thin sheets of window glass, silvered at the back. The troughs are parabolic in cross section and at the focus of each is hung a tubular boiler painted black to absorb the heat rays. The five boilers feed a common steam reservoir from which steam is fed to a pump. This pump raises about 6,000 gallons of water per minute, which is used for irrigating purposes. Of course at night the supply of energy is cut off and on cloudy or rainy days no steam is generated, but such days are few in the region of Cairo, and continuous operation is not essential to the operation of irrigating systems.\n\nThere are localities in Africa, Asia Minor, and even in the United States where the lack of water and the pitiless rays of the sun have turned vast regions into deserts. Here the very rays which have parched vegetation may be utilized to pump water over the thirsty lands and convert them into rich agricultural regions.\n\nThere is another mighty source of power in the internal heat of the earth. Here and there all over the earth are vent holes through which the pent-up energy makes its escape in the form of steam, gases, or molten lava. There is no question as to the enormous stores of energy in active volcanoes, and as we appreciate the value of heat energy our eyes[179] turn covetously to these great chimneys of the subterranean furnaces.\n\nHARNESSING VOLCANOES\nIt seems like the height of daring to attempt to harness the volcanoes, and yet there is a plant in Italy which utilizes volcanic energy and develops useful power from it. At Volterra, in the province of Tuscany, there is a volcanic region where jets of very hot steam issue from cracks in the ground. These steam jets, known as soffioni, are laden with gases and mineral matter. For many years the boric acid that they contain was abstracted from them, but the steam was allowed to escape. In some few instances it was piped into houses and used for domestic heating. In 1908 an attempt was made to convert the energy of the steam into useful power. Holes were bored into the earth and steam of a temperature of 302 degrees Fahrenheit came up the pipes. This steam was applied directly to a forty horsepower steam engine, and for the first time volcanic heat was set to work. The steam, however, contained so many impurities that it was impracticable to use it directly in the engine. The valves and cylinders were soon clogged with deposits of boric acid. Then instead of trying to obtain power directly from the steam, the latter was used to heat a boiler in which pure steam was generated. This plan proved perfectly practical and a 300 horsepower condensing steam turbine was driven by the energy thus obtained indirectly from volcanic heat. This power was converted into electricity and the power was transmitted to the surrounding villages. After the World War broke out and Italy began to feel the shortage of fuel, the[180] price of coal having risen to $50 per ton, the use of volcanic power was extended. A 3,000 kilowatt plant was installed and electric current was transmitted to Florence, Leghorn, Volterra, and other towns of Tuscany. The exhaust steam from the boilers was utilized in the boric acid industries.\n\nOther projects for utilizing the internal heat of the earth have been given serious consideration in Italy. Near Naples there is the dormant volcano, Solfatara, the crater of which is filled with a sea of very hot mud underlying a cool thin crust of earth. Holes bored into this mud to a depth of a few feet send forth steam hot enough to do useful work and a plan to utilize this store of energy is under way.\n\nPOWER FROM THE CORE OF THE EARTH\nThere are regions where the ground is red-hot at a depth of a hundred feet. While there is no water present to furnish steam, it is a simple matter to sink a water pipe down to the heated earth and then, around this pipe, to drive a ring of smaller pipes through which steam may find its way up to the top and be fed either into water heaters or directly into steam engines. In fact it has been suggested that such a scheme might be used almost anywhere. If we bore into the earth, we find that the temperature grows higher the deeper we go. The rate of increase of temperature varies with different localities, but it is very evident that anywhere on earth temperatures that will give a steam pressure of ten or more pounds per square inch can be obtained if we dig down far enough, and when we find it worth while to do so we shall probably riddle the earth\u2019s crust with perforations[181] through which water will be sent down to the subterranean furnaces and it will return to us laden with heat energy.\n\nAfter all, we shall not be plunged into dire want when our stores of coal are exhausted. There will be other sources of power to draw upon, most of which will be inexhaustible. Furthermore, we have recently discovered in atoms of matter stores of energy incomparably greater than any that have heretofore been used to work the will of man. How to utilize this energy we have not yet learned, but the energy is there, and no doubt, some day, probably long before coal takes its place in museum collections, we shall be possessed of a new slave, far more powerful than that which has served us so far.\n\n[182]\n\nCHAPTER XII\nINVASION OF THE SEA\n\nTHE POSSIBILITY that the wind was the first inanimate power utilized by man, has already been referred to. There are records of the use of sailing vessels in Egypt that date as far back as 6,000 years before Christ. Navigators of that early date, however, could hardly claim to have mastered the wind. They merely used wind power when the wind was disposed to help them. If the winds were adverse, they had no recourse other than to furl their sail, step the mast and depend upon oars to propel them to the desired port. It was not until thousands of years later that primitive mariners learned how to tack and pursue a zigzag course against the wind. When this knowledge was acquired we do not know, but it is certain that the Ph\u0153nicians, who rounded the continent of Africa 1,200 years before Christ, knew how to make use of the power of opposing winds. Of course they could not explain how it was that a breeze could be made to drive a vessel in a direction across and even opposed to that in which it was blowing. In order to understand this apparent paradox ourselves, we must go back to the very elements of mechanics.\n\nELEMENTARY MECHANICS\nThe popular conception of force is something that produces motion, but its true definition is \u201cthat[183] which tends to produce or resist motion.\u201d There are forces in existence when there is no motion. When you hold a weight in your hand there is a force tending to pull the weight to the earth, but this force is opposed by an equal force exerted by your muscles in holding up the weight. There is no motion because the two forces are perfectly balanced. If they were unbalanced, there would be motion in the direction of the greater force. If the pull of the arm is greater than that of gravity, the weight will be lifted, and if the weight is too heavy for the arm to support, it will go down despite muscular efforts to prevent it. In one case the force of gravity will endeavor to destroy motion by opposing the lift of the arm, and in the other case the arm will endeavor to resist motion by opposing the pull of gravity. A book on a table is motionless and yet it is acted upon by two forces which are opposed to each other and hence balanced. The table furnishes a force which resists and balances the force exerted by gravity. If the book were heavy enough, in other words, if the force directed downward were great enough, the table would be crushed.\n\nWhen two forces are in perfect balance they must be equal and opposite. Unless the directions of the two forces are exactly opposite, there will be motion in some new direction. Suppose we use an apparatus such as shown in Fig. 56 to study the result of three coacting forces. It consists of a T-shaped frame with a pulley P at each end of the cross arm. These pulleys turn very freely on their axes, so that we need not be concerned with any appreciable amount of friction. Two fine cords running over these pulleys are knotted at O to a third[184] short cord. Each cord is provided with a hook on which weights may be hung. Now if we put a pound weight on each cord the two A and B will raise the weight C until the angles between the cords at O are all equal. In other words each force of one pound is balanced by two other forces of one pound each pulling at an angle of 120 degrees to it and to each other. If we put a 3-pound weight at A, a 4-pound weight at B and a 5-pound weight at C, the cords will come to rest in the position shown in Fig. 57. The weight B being heavier than weight A will pull the knot O to the right until the angle between the cords running to these weights is a right angle.\n\n\nFIG. 56.\u2014BALANCED FORCES\u2014EQUAL WEIGHTS\n\nPARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES\nAlthough a force is something that cannot be pictured it can be represented graphically by means of a line, letting the direction of the line represent the direction of the force and the length of the line the strength of the force. In Figure 58 we may[185] measure off 3 inches from O to a to indicate the 3-pound force and 4 inches from O to b to represent the 4-pound force and 5 inches from O to c to represent the 5-pound force. Now if from a a line is drawn parallel to O b and from b a line is drawn parallel to O a we shall have a parallelogram a O b d, and if we extend the line O c it will bisect the parallelogram, running diagonally from O to d, and this diagonal will be found to measure exactly 5 inches which represents the 5-pound force. This is what is known as the parallelogram of forces. It shows us the resultant of any two forces that are not directly opposite and it gives us the direction as well as the strength or magnitude of this resultant. It is only because we happen to choose the forces 3, 4 and 5 that the angle at O is a right angle. In Figure 59, where the forces are all equal, our parallelogram is lozenge-shaped and the line O d is just as long as the line O a and O b, showing that its magnitude is the same as that of the two forces that balanced it.\n\n\nFIG. 57.\u2014BALANCED FORCES\u2014UNEQUAL WEIGHTS\n\n[186]\n\nThe greater the angle between the two lifting forces the less weight can they lift. If two men are carrying a ten-pound satchel, each will be lifting five pounds, if the pull is directly upward; but this is a rather inconvenient way of carrying the bag and usually they pull at a slight angle from the vertical, and so each must carry more than half the weight. If they move so far apart that the angle between them is more than 120 degrees, each will be carrying more than the full weight of the bag.\n\n\nFIGS. 58 AND 59.\u2014PARALLELOGRAMS OF FORCES\n\nSAILING AGAINST THE WIND\nNow that we know something about the parallelogram of forces we may return to the problem of sailing across and against the wind. In Fig. 60 we are looking down on the deck of a ship and the wind is represented by the arrow. The dotted line A B represents the direction in which the boat is traveling and the line C D represents the plane of a sail. If the line E F represents the magnitude and[187] direction of the force of the wind at the center of the sail, then we can tell how much pressure is being exerted directly against the sail, by drawing the line g F perpendicular to the sail and completing the parallelogram by drawing from E a line parallel to the sail intersecting g F at G and another line parallel to g F intersecting the plane of the sail at H. Then the length of the line G F represents the pressure against the sail. If the line G F is half as long as the line E F, then only half of the force of the wind is exerted in the direction G F. In other words, a wind pressure of one pound per square foot blowing in the direction of G F will do as much work as two pounds in the direction E F. The force of the wind has been broken up into two \u201ccomponents,\u201d one (G F) at right angles to the sail, and the other (H F) edgewise to the plane, and of course the latter has no effect upon the propulsion of the boat.\n\n\nFIG. 60.\u2014FORCES THAT MOVE A SAILBOAT\n\nIf there were nothing to prevent it, the boat would sail in the direction G F; but the keel of the boat[188] offers resistance to motion in this direction, and we must construct another parallelogram around the force G F to find the magnitude of the force exerted in the direction A B. The line K F is drawn at right angles to A B, and then the parallelogram is completed by drawing a line from G to K parallel to the line A B and another from G to M parallel to K F. We have then resolved to force G F into two components M F and K F. The former tends to push the boat along its course while the latter tends to make it drift to leeward. The length of the line M F is little more than a quarter of the length of the wind force E F and the leeward acting force K F is actually considerably greater than the forward acting force M F. Even with a deep keel there will be some drift to leeward. This is corrected by means of the rudder of the ship which is turned to head the ship further into the wind so that although the boat does not actually travel in the direction of its axis it may be made to travel along the course A B. Of course the boat cannot sail directly against the wind, but it can accomplish the same result by tacking alternately to port and starboard so that eventually it can reach a port that lies in the direction from which the wind comes.\n\nTHE SPEEDY CLIPPER\nBefore the advent of the steamship, sailing vessels were developed to a high degree of efficiency. The speedy clippers of 1816 to 1845 used to cross the Atlantic at an average speed of 6 to 9 miles per hour and sometimes even better, which compares favorably with a common steam freighter of to-day. The largest sailing vessel ever built was the Thomas W. Lawson, a seven-masted schooner. She[189] was launched in 1902, but foundered in 1907 off the Scilly Islands. This great ship was a steel vessel 395 feet long, with a displacement of 10,000 tons and a cargo capacity of 7,500 tons. She had a sail spread of 40,617 feet.\n\nFROM OARS TO PROPELLERS\nAlthough a century has elapsed since the first steam-driven vessel made its way across the Atlantic Ocean, sails have been as yet by no means swept off the face of the sea. Nevertheless, even when sailing vessels had no competitors they did not furnish a perfectly satisfactory means of transportation. The fickleness of wind power was felt in this application as well as in that of windmills, and inventors racked their brains for some more certain means of propelling ships. Naturally, when the steam engine was a proven success, efforts were made to apply this newly discovered power to ships. How to make steam drive a ship was a problem. At first it was proposed to use a system of oars which would be moved back and forth in imitation of oarsmen and John Fitch\u2019s first steamboat in 1786 was driven by a set of paddles operated in a manner similar to that of paddling a canoe. It was a very natural evolution from oars to paddle wheel, which consists of a series of oars mounted in a wheel so that they will come into play one after the other. The propeller, although not invented by Col. John Stevens (as has been popularly supposed), was first applied by him to steam navigation when he constructed a small steamboat on the Hudson River in 1804. But the simplicity of the paddle wheel and its high efficiency, particularly in quiet harbors and shallow inland waters, gave it preference over the propeller.[190] In rough seas, however, the paddle wheel was far from ideal. It was too easily broken by heavy waves and between 1855 and 1865 the propeller displaced it completely for ocean-going vessels.\n\nWATER JET PROPULSION\nAnother curious form of propulsion, which dates back to the eighteenth century and is still periodically revived by inventors, is the water jet. The idea was to have the engine operate a pump which would drive a stream of water out of the stern of the boat and drive the boat by reaction. The British Government actually built two jet-propelled steamers. One of them, called the Waterwitch, was a 1,100-ton vessel and the other, the Squirt, was a small torpedo boat. The latter attained a speed of but twelve knots while a sister ship of the same steam power driven by a propeller attained a speed of seventeen knots. The Waterwitch was even less efficient. Some years ago experimental water-jet vessels were built in New York in which a jet only \u215d inch in diameter with a pressure of 2,500 pounds per square inch was used, but the experiment proved a failure. The propelling force of a jet is the reaction of the stream of water against the orifice from which it issues. The action is just like Hero\u2019s reaction steam turbine referred to on page 143. The propulsion would be the same were the jet discharged in the open air or in a vacuum or against a solid stone wall.\n\nWATER AND AIR RESISTANCE\nIt takes very little power to move a boat slowly because the resistance that has to be overcome is merely the parting of the water at the bow and[191] closing in of the water at the stern and the skin friction along the sides of the hull. In addition to this there is a similar resistance offered by the air. At very low speeds the resistances of the water and the air are practically negligible. In perfectly quiet water with no air stirring the pull of a cord will move a ship weighing hundreds of tons, but the motion will be very slow indeed. Unfortunately the speed of a ship does not increase directly in proportion to the power that drives it. Doubling the power does not double the speed. If it takes ten horsepower to drive a vessel at a speed of ten knots it will take not 2 but 2\u00b3 or 8 times as much power to drive it at a speed of twenty knots. In other words, the horsepower goes up as the cube of the speed. This is an average condition for ordinary speeds. For very high speeds the horsepower may have to be increased as the 4th and even the 5th power of the speed. The shape of the bow and the stern is of utmost importance. The parting and displacement of the water at the bow and the replacement at the stern produce waves and the forming of these waves represents so much wasted energy. The swell that is kicked up by a steamer is evidence of power uselessly expended. Much of this loss can be overcome by careful design of the ship\u2019s lines. A vessel that kicks up a high bow wave\u2014one that sails with a \u201cbone in its teeth\u201d\u2014may present a very pleasing spectacle and may seem to be traveling at high speed, but the best designed vessel\u2014the one that slips through the water with no fuss\u2014is much more economical of power. It is easy to understand that the bow must be carefully designed to cut through the water, but it is not so apparent that the stern must also be shaped to permit the water[192] to flow in readily and fill in the void behind the ship. If the stern is not carefully shaped, there will be a serious drag on the vessel. The skin friction of the vessel is greatly increased by fouling of the hull with marine growths. At high speeds the wind pressure on the superstructure is considerable. Every spar and line adds its quota. A boat that is traveling in still air at a speed of twenty-two knots or twenty-five miles per hour is encountering the equivalent of a twenty-five mile wind which will exert a pressure of over three pounds per square foot of frontage.\n\nFLYING ON WATER\nInstead of cutting through the water modern speed boats are designed to ride over it. The boats have flat bottoms which are arranged as a series of flat planes known as hydroplanes. These planes form steps and are set at such an angle as to make the boat rise up on the water in the same way that a kite rises in the air. The higher the speed the higher the boat rises so that at full speed it skims on the surface. Hence there is comparatively little power wasted in displacing the water. Some of these boats are driven by air propellers so that water resistance to the propeller gear is avoided. These hydroplanes (they must not be confused with hydroaeroplanes) almost fly over the water.\n\nFIRST OCEAN STEAMER\nIt was in 1807 that Robert Fulton built the Clermont and established steam navigation by running a regular service between New York and Albany, and it was twelve years later that the Atlantic Ocean was first crossed by a steam-driven vessel. It was an American vessel, the Savannah, that[193] made the trip. She was a 380-ton ship equipped with steam power to help her along when the wind failed. Seventy-five tons of coal and twenty-five cords of kindling wood were taken aboard to feed her furnace. This was thought to be ample for the voyage, but before the trip was completed the fuel was all gone. The log of the Savannah bears this entry the night before sighting the Irish coast: \u201c2 A. M. Calm. No cole to get up steam.\u201d However the captain did raise steam just before reaching Kinsale, Ireland, by burning wood. Watchers ashore beholding the smoke issuing from her stack were convinced that the vessel was afire and boats were dispatched to the rescue. The Savannah made the trip from Savannah to Kinsale in 23 days and was under steam propulsion for only 80 hours of this time.\n\nRegular trans-Atlantic steam service was not inaugurated until 1838, but for many decades steamers were equipped with sails to assist them when the wind was favorable.\n\nThe most notable of early steamships was the Great Eastern, a combined screw and paddle-wheel ship, 692 feet long, built in 1858. She held the record for size until 1899 when the Oceanic, 704 feet long, was put into service. At present the Leviathan, formerly the Vaterland, holds the record with a length of 920 feet. It is difficult to judge of the size of a vessel out on the open water. If the Leviathan were placed in Broadway, New York, she would span nearly four blocks. Because of her 100-foot beam she would be too wide to be wedged in between the skyscrapers that border lower Broadway. If she were set up on end she would tower 158 feet above the pinnacle of the Woolworth Building. Her power plant consists of four turbines which total[194] 90,000 horsepower and the huge vessel is driven at a speed of 25.8 knots or nearly thirty miles per hour.\n\nThe wonder of these huge floating structures lies not merely in their gigantic proportions but in the fact that they are able to weather the terrific wrenching strains of heavy ocean storms. A skyscraper is built to withstand only the steady and direct pull of gravity and the variable thrust of the wind which, except in western cyclones, seldom amounts to thirty pounds per square foot. Bridge building is more difficult because of the leverage of the parts overhanging the foundations. Wind pressures must be calculated and also the live load of objects moving over the structure. In naval architecture enter the problems of building construction combined with those of bridge building, complicated by the fact that there is no fixed foundation for the structure to rest upon. At one moment a ship may be spanning a trough in the seas and at the next it may be seesawing over the crest of the wave. Of course the bottom of the boat is seldom if ever out of the water and a certain amount of support is provided throughout the length of the vessel, but the ship is subjected to the strains of a cantilever bridge when she is passing over a wave, and to the strains of a truss bridge when spanning a wave trough. These strains are increased by the fact that the structure is in constant motion. A certain degree of flexibility is demanded of the materials which go into the structure and of the joints between the frame members.\n\nBOATS OF ARTIFICIAL STONE\nOriginally wood was used for the hulls of ships; then between 1845 and 1855 iron supplanted wood,[195] Between 1875 and 1885 steel supplanted iron and to-day efforts are being made to supplant steel with concrete. The advantages offered by concrete are cheapness and speed of construction. The first large vessel built of this material was the Faith, an 8,000-ton ship. This boat stood up very well in heavy weather despite the rigidity of her structure. It is doubtful, however, that a large boat comparable in size to the Leviathan could weather a severe ocean storm.\n\nThe proposal to build ships of cement created almost as much of a popular sensation as did the first iron boat. Although the public had accepted iron and then steel as a perfectly proper material for shipbuilding, concrete seemed too much like stone and it did not seem possible that artificial stone could be made to float. They did not realize that a cubic foot of steel weighs four times as much as the same volume of concrete. Of course concrete does not begin to have the tensile strength of steel and consequently the walls of a concrete ship must be made relatively thick. For this reason a concrete vessel is heavier than a steel vessel. She draws more water and requires a larger power plant, and because of her greater mass she is not so readily maneuvered.\n\nSUBMARINE NAVIGATION\nAs was explained in Chapter VI, a body will float only so long as it is lighter than the volume of water it displaces. It is almost impossible to keep a body suspended in water unless some portion of it is exposed above the surface. If it starts sinking it will keep on going down until it reaches the bottom of the sea. There is a popular notion that at great depths water becomes dense enough to float[196] solid iron, but water is practically incompressible and its density at a depth of five miles is only slightly greater than that at the surface. An object must therefore either float on the surface or sink to the bottom, unless its weight is exactly equal to the difference between the upward pressure of the water under it and the downward pressure of the water above it. Such an ideal balance it is practically impossible to obtain unless the object itself is compressible.\n\nHow then can a submarine navigate under water without sinking to the bottom?\n\nA SUBMARINE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\nThe first solution to this problem dates back to the seventeenth century. Doctor Cornelius Van Drebel, a Netherlander, who was a guest at the court of King James I of England, built three submarines between 1620 and 1624. These were rowboats covered over with a water-tight deck and propelled by twelve oarsmen. It is recorded that Van Drebel discovered a means of holding the boats submerged by observing some fishermen towing baskets full of fish up the Thames. The barks to which the baskets were attached by cables were weighted down by the load they were towing, but when the cables slackened the boats rose a little bit. Van Drebel\u2019s method of applying this principle was evidently to attach a weight to the boat which trailed along the bottom. When the oarsmen propelled the boat, she was pulled down under the surface by the drag, but when the rowing ceased the boat would float up to the surface. King James himself is said to have made a journey of several hours\u2019 duration in one these boats, which was kept at a depth of[197] twelve to fifteen feet below the surface. Progress must have been very slow because the range of the submarine was given as five or six miles.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War David Bushnell built a submarine with which attempts were made to sink a British frigate lying in the Hudson River. This submarine was driven by a hand-operated screw propeller. The boat was provided with water ballast tanks, and by pressing a valve with one foot he could let in water enough to submerge the boat while with the other foot he could operate a pump to empty the tanks and bring the boat to the surface. When the boat was ballasted so that she would barely float, a vertical screw propeller was operated to raise or lower her as much as desired. A 200-pound lead weight was attached to a long cable which passed up through the bottom of the boat, and by letting out this cable the submarine could be made to rise instantly in case of an accident.\n\nFULTON\u2019S HAND-PROPELLED SUBMARINE\nTo Robert Fulton, however, belongs the credit of building the first submarine operating on the principle that is now universally used. His boat was also driven by a hand-operated screw propeller and was furnished with water tanks which could be filled or pumped out at will, but after the submarine was weighted until only the conning tower showed above water, she was submerged or raised by means of horizontal rudders or hydroplanes which could be tilted to any angle desired. Of course these rudders, like any other rudders, would not operate unless the boat were in motion. Such is the case with modern submarines. Like bicycles, they must keep on going or they will fall. If they[198] are heavy, they will fall to the bottom, and if light they will \u201cfall\u201d to the surface. When in motion the hydroplanes will either hold them down or lift them up according to the angle to which these horizontal rudders are tipped.\n\nRobert Fulton\u2019s Nautilus had a fish-shaped hull of copper plating on iron ribs and was twenty-one feet three inches long by six feet five inches at her greatest diameter. The screw propeller was operated by two men. When the boat was on the surface a sail was raised to assist in driving the boat. This sail could be folded up like a fan when it was desired to submerge.\n\nFulton deserves full credit for anticipating so many of the essential features of the modern submarine, but of course the Nautilus was a mere toy compared to the marvelous machines which swim under the surface of the sea to-day.\n\nThe German U-boats at the outbreak of the war were 150 feet long and could make only nine knots submerged and twelve knots on the surface, but later they grew to a length of 300 feet with a submerged speed of twelve knots and a surface speed of eighteen knots. The British in the meantime developed a submarine that was 340 feet long and had a displacement submerged of 2,700 tons as against 800 for the largest German U-boats. The speed of this big British boat is twenty-four knots on the surface and ten knots submerged.\n\nSUBMARINES AS SURFACE BOATS\nDespite their name, submarines are really surface boats. Only when necessity demands are they submerged. During the war even the U-boats did 90 per cent of their sailing on the surface. Origially[199] submarines were built primarily for submerged travel and consequently they were given the form of a fish or of a fat cigar, but such a shape was not adapted for surface sailing. Water piled up on the nose of the boat and tended to bear her down. To overcome this, submarines are now shaped more like a boat with a bow high enough to part the waves without burrowing into them.\n\nPOWER PLANT OF A SUBMARINE\nThe gasoline engines that were formerly used for propelling the boats have now given way to heavy oil or Diesel engines, because of the greater efficiency of these engines and the greater safety of handling heavy oil. Some submarines have been equipped with steam power plants. Such is the power used on the big British submarines above referred to. Of course any power that involves the burning of fuel can only be used on the surface. As has already been explained, an internal combustion engine burns seven to nine times as much air as oil and it would be impossible to store enough air on board to keep the engines going very long; hence they can be operated only while the hatches are open to the atmosphere.\n\nCoupled to the shafts of the engines are dynamos which generate electricity and feed it to storage batteries. A dynamo will serve as a generator when turned by some mechanical power and on the other hand when current is fed into it, it serves as a motor, so that when traveling submerged and fuel can no longer be used, the generators are disconnected from the engines but remain connected to the propeller shafts and driven by the very current they previously stored in the batteries.\n\n[200]\n\nTHE COLLAPSIBLE \u201cEYE\u201d OF THE SUBMARINE\nAmidships there is a bridge from which the vessel can be navigated when on the surface and a conning tower from which she can be navigated when running awash. Most of the submerged travel is maintained at a comparatively shallow depth so that the submarine can keep an \u201ceye\u201d on the surface. The eye is the periscope of which there are two so that in case of damage to one the other may be used. Periscopes date back to the \u201cFifties\u201d when they were used on some experimental European submarines. In the Civil War, when the river monitor Osage ran aground in the Red River, her captain, now Rear-Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge, rigged up a periscope with which he could look over the high banks of the river and direct the fire of his guns upon a Confederate force that was attacking him. This periscope consisted merely of a three-inch pipe with a hole at each end cut in opposite sides of the pipe. Small mirrors were set in the pipe so that the light coming in through the upper hole was reflected down through the pipe and out of the lower hole. This crude periscope is the same in principle as the modern submarine periscopes except that the latter are provided with lenses to gather and focus all the light possible on the eyepiece so that the operator will have a perfectly clear view. Periscopes extend fifteen to twenty feet above the roof of the conning tower. While periscopes are insignificant objects on the broad seas when a submarine is moving very slowly, they are made conspicuous by the wake of foam that follows them when the boat is traveling even at a moderate speed. For this reason during the war the Germans developed[201] a telescoping periscope which could be shot up to the surface whenever desired in order to give the commander a glimpse of his surroundings.\n\nThe submarine is submerged by letting water into the ballast tanks and then turning the hydroplanes to a diving angle. There is an after as well as a forward pair of diving rudders.\n\nWhen running completely submerged the submarine is blind and solely dependent upon the chart and compass. It is impossible to see far under water. Searchlights are of no value at all. They will not make visible an object a hundred feet away. The submarine commander cannot see even the bow of the boat he is piloting. The ordinary magnetic compass will not operate when entirely incased in steel as it is in the hull of the submarine and so a gyroscope compass has to be used instead.\n\nWhile the compass serves as a guide for travel in the horizontal plane the depth gauge must be watched to see that the boat does not dive too deeply. The pressure of the sea increases at the rate of 64 pounds per foot of depth. Two hundred feet below the surface the pressure amounts to about six tons on every square foot of the surface of the submarine. Few submarines can stand a greater pressure than that without being crushed or at least springing serious leaks. When coming to the surface the hydroplanes are used and if the boat is to remain on the surface water is blown out of the ballast tanks.\n\nTHE \u201cEARS\u201d OF A SUBMARINE\nAlthough submarines may be blind under water they are not deaf. Sound detectors are used which enable them to locate other vessels by the throbbing of their engines or the beat of their propellers and[202] so they can avoid collisions when coming up to the surface.\n\nDespite the perfection of the submarine the sea is still a great mystery to us. We know only its surface and its shallows. We have sounded a few deep holes and brought up samples of deep-sea life, but we have not been able to penetrate in person its profound depths and explore with our eyes and hands the world that is buried beneath its waves. Three quarters of the globe is covered by water and if we are to claim complete mastery of the earth we must find some way of descending into the heart of the ocean and exploring its deepest valleys.\n\n[203]\n\nCHAPTER XIII\nSLIDING, ROLLING, WALKING, AND CREEPING\n\nIN ALL forms of transportation friction plays a most important part. If there were no such thing as friction, it would be impossible for us to set an object in motion by the means that are now commonly in use, and once the object were moving it would be impossible to stop it except by bringing it up against a wall set squarely across its path.\n\nIn transportation on land friction is a much more serious bar to motion than it is in marine or aerial transportation. There are two kinds of friction that we have to contend with; sliding friction when two contacting surfaces are dragged by each other; and rolling friction when one surface rolls upon another. It is impossible to obtain two surfaces that are absolutely smooth; there are minute elevations in each that sink into minute depressions of the other like intermeshing teeth and a grinding action takes place as these microscopic inequalities are broken away. Oil reduces the friction by filling up these inequalities, but the oil itself offers a certain amount of friction just as water does along the sides of a moving ship.\n\nROLLING FRICTION\nRolling friction is of a different kind. The intermeshing inequalities or microscopic teeth are[204] lifted out of contact with, one another just as the teeth of gear wheels are carried out of mesh. But there is another cause of friction due to the fact that no objects are so microscopic that they do not sink into each other to some extent. A wheel is always rolling out the surface it is turning on just as a rolling pin rolls out dough. If the surface is of elastic material such as a steel rail, it springs back into place immediately after the passage of the wheel, but the wheel must constantly travel in the trough of a wave which accompanies it along the rail. There is a similar wave in the wheel itself and this ironing-out action produces heat in the wheel and the rail. It is particularly noticeable in the flexible tires of automobiles which, after a run on even a smooth road, become too hot to be grasped with the bare hand merely because of the waves of compression and decompression to which they are subjected.\n\nBoth rolling and sliding friction are increased by pressure because the depression is greater and because inequalities are brought into more intimate engagement with one another. The degree of friction also depends upon the nature of the substances in contact, but theoretically the area of contact does not make any difference. It is just as hard to push a block along a smooth surface on its edge as on its side.\n\nPUTTING ROLLERS BETWEEN LOAD AND ROAD\nAs intimated in Chapter I the forerunner of the wheel was probably the roller. It was much easier to move a heavy object on rollers because rolling friction was substituted for sliding friction, but the rollers would not stay under the object; they[205] traveled only half as fast as the load they carried. To make them keep up with the load they had to be mounted on axles which were fastened either directly to the load or to a cart body on which the load was supported. Thus the wheel came to be invented, but except for the fact that it stays by its load and does not roll out from under it a common wheel is not to be compared with a roller for efficiency. To be sure, it substitutes rolling friction for sliding friction where it contacts with the road, but the friction at the axle is sliding rather than rolling. However, drawing an object on wheels is a decided improvement over sliding it along the road, for two reasons: the sliding friction at the axle is reduced to a minimum by choosing materials that will slide upon each other with comparatively little resistance, by polishing them smooth and by lubricating them. But even if these precautions were not taken there would be a distinct advantage in the use of wheels because of the relatively shorter travel at the axle than at the rim of the wheel. If a wheel is thirty inches in diameter and turns on an axle one inch in diameter, it will travel thirty times as far at the rim as it does at the axle; hence the sliding friction at the axle is far less than it would be at the point of contact with the ground, were the wheel locked so that it could not turn. But it is not necessary to have any sliding friction at the axle if we revert to the old roller system that prevailed before the day of the wheel. The axle may be considered the load and the axle bearing the road. We can then put rollers between load and road. Because the road is a circular one that travels with the load we can line it with rollers throughout its length, and the load will never lack for rollers to[206] roll upon. Thus we have the roller bearing which is so widely used in modern vehicles. Ball bearings operate on the same principle except that the balls furnish less contacting surface and are not so suitable for supporting heavy loads, as are rollers. Sliding friction is almost completely eliminated and unless heavily loaded a wheel on ball bearings will not heat even when the bearings are not lubricated.\n\nREDUCING ROAD FRICTION\nWhile there is little friction between a wheel and the roadway upon which it travels, the roughness of the road is a very important factor. Every time a wheel goes over a stone the entire vehicle must be lifted; this represents so much wasted energy. The advantage of the pneumatic tire lies in the fact that it absorbs small inequalities without making it necessary for the entire vehicle to rise over them. This means less load lifted and hence less work done. Large wheels are better than small ones because they do not sink so deeply into depressions and because they surmount small obstacles more readily. On a steel track the size of the wheel does not make so much difference as it does on a road because the track surface is smooth and is but little depressed by the wheel. It has been estimated that a horse can pull ten times as great a load on rails as on an ordinary macadamed road. Some years ago broad steel tracks were laid in some of our city streets for the use of horse-drawn trucks. They served very well as far as the vehicles were concerned. The road friction was reduced considerably, but the fact was overlooked that the horses needed a good friction surface under their feet. Two horses could not pull a truck along the track without[207] walking on the track and the smooth steel made such slippery footing that the tracks had to be torn out and replaced with common paving.\n\nINCREASING TRACK FRICTION\nThe difference between sliding and rolling friction is well illustrated in a locomotive. The driving wheels are turned around by steam power. They must either roll or slide on the track and the load they will pull without slipping is a measure of the excess of sliding friction over rolling friction. To increase the traction or the adhesion of the locomotive to the track it is provided with a number of driving wheels. In some of our largest locomotives driving wheels are placed under the tender so as to obtain a maximum of traction.\n\nANCIENT LINEAGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE\nWhen it was first proposed to substitute steam propulsion for the horse it was not realized that a rail would furnish enough traction to permit of hauling heavy loads, and some of the early locomotives that ran on rails were provided with toothed wheels that engaged in racks alongside the rails. In fact, the earliest locomotives were not built to run on rails but on ordinary roads; in other words, they were automobiles. The motor car can therefore boast of a more ancient lineage than the railroad engine. Joseph Cugnot of France is said to have built a three-wheeled steam carriage in 1769 which was so top-heavy that it upset when making a sharp turn at three miles per hour. Several steam carriages were built in England in the eighteenth century, but they were not successful. The real father of steam traction was Richard Trevithic, of Camborne,[208] Cornwall, whose first steam carriage, built in 1801, carried eight passengers. His third machine, built in 1804, was the first to run on rails. This was strictly a locomotive intended to haul cars. It ran with its load at the astonishing speed of five miles an hour. Trevithic was the first to exhaust the steam from the cylinders into the smoke-stack and thereby increase the draft through the furnace and generated steam at higher pressure.\n\nAll the early locomotives used toothed gears to turn the driving wheels until George Stephenson introduced connecting rods to drive the driving wheels direct from the pistons. George Stephenson\u2019s \u201cRocket,\u201d built in 1829, won a prize of 500 pounds in a speed contest when it established a record of 24 1-6 miles per hour. It also established the doubtful honor of being the first mechanical speed monster to exact the toll of human life. On its prize run it ran over a man and killed him.\n\nSTEPHENSON\u2019S LINK MOTION\n[209]\n\n\nFIG. 61.\u2014STEPHENSON\u2019S LINK MOTION\n\nStephenson\u2019s son Robert is commonly credited with the invention of an ingenious link motion, although the invention is also claimed for W. T. James of New York. We must pause a moment for a description of this ingenious link motion, because it became a standard in locomotive construction that is still in service. As explained in Chapter IX steam should be used expansively in order to obtain a maximum of efficiency. After a certain amount of steam has been admitted into the cylinder it is cut off from the boiler and it pushes the piston by its own expansion. The speed of the locomotive must be varied by varying the point of cut-off, and the direction of motion of the locomotive is reversed by reversing the motion of the valve. In the Stephenson link motion this is all effected by the operation of a single lever. Fig. 61 shows the arrangement. The valve is moved back and forth by the rod A which is connected to the arm B suspended from the frame of the locomotive. The drive shaft is shown at C and it carries two eccentrics projecting on opposite sides of the shaft which move the rods D and E back and forth. The outer ends of these rods are connected to opposite ends of a curved link F and a pin G on the arm B engages a slot in the link. The link is held up by a rod H. As the drive shaft rotates the slotted link is oscillated back and forth on its own center. When the link is lowered so that the pin G is at the center of the slot there is no motion of the valve rod A, but when the pin is at the top or at the bottom of the slot the valve rod has its greatest motion. As the top of the link is moving[210] in one direction while the bottom is moving in the other direction, it will be plain that the action of the valve when G is at the top of the link will be the reverse of the action when G is at the bottom. The link is raised and lowered by means of a lever I which is connected to one arm of a T-shaped lever J which on one side of its fulcrum is connected to the rod H and on the other to the counterweight K.\n\nThere are certain defects in the Stephenson link motion that we cannot discuss here. These became serious as engines grew larger and more powerful so that to-day it has been largely superseded by other valve gears. The most important of these is the Walschaerts gear, invented by a Belgian engineer. This gear, unlike Stephenson\u2019s, is conspicuously placed outside the drivers and is particularly noticeable because of its peculiar grasshopper motion. The action of the gear is so complicated that a description of it would be out of place in this book.\n\nMODERN LOCOMOTIVES\nWe cannot enter minutely into the development of the locomotive from the crude machine of Trevithic\u2019s time to monsters of to-day. There has been a progressive growth of locomotives in power and in speed. Our biggest freight engines are so powerful that they cannot be used for pulling alone because they can pull a greater load than the draw-bars of the cars can stand. If placed at the head of a long train they would yank the forward cars loose from the rest. Hence they are placed at the rear of the train to act as pushers or in the middle of the train where half their energy is expended in pushing the cars ahead of them and the other half in pulling the rest of the train.\n\n[211]\n\nThe most powerful steam locomotive of to-day (1921) weighs 342 tons and its tender 107 making a total of 449 tons. Its length is 105 feet and its boiler 8 feet 7\u215b inches in diameter. Its low pressure cylinders (4 feet in diameter) are larger than the locomotive boilers of 50 years ago. Its high pressure cylinders are 30 inches in diameter and the stroke is 32 inches. It may be operated either compound or simple, i. e., the smaller cylinders may exhaust into the larger ones or they may take steam direct from the boiler. The tractive effort compound is 147,200 pounds and simple 176,600 pounds and the total horsepower developed is 5,040. Each cylinder drives five coupled drivers, in other words there are twenty power-driven wheels with a pair of trailers and a pair of pilot wheels. Six and a half tons of coal are consumed per hour.\n\nIn the matter of speed a mile per minute has become common and regular scheduled runs over long distances at an average well above sixty miles per hour have been maintained, but the present tendency is to reduce speed somewhat in favor of safety.\n\nThere are two inventions that have made possible the high speeds of modern railroad travel: the air brake, which has already been described; and the block signal system. The latter, of which there are a number of different types, being electrical, does not properly belong in this book.\n\nStoking a large freight engine or a high speed passenger locomotive is strenuous work. Three tons of coal per hour is not an uncommon rate of consumption. The fireman on a fast express train gets little rest. To relieve him of this exhaustive work automatic stokers are now being used. These convey the coal from the tender to the fire box and[212] feed the fuel at a uniform rate. In place of solid fuel, oil is extensively used in regions where it may readily be obtained. This simplifies the task of firing the locomotives. There has also been some use of powdered coal which is blown into the furnace in much the same way as oil is.\n\nTo-day steam locomotives have found a serious competitor in the electric locomotive, which is steadily increasing in favor.\n\nWhere traffic is heavy, where long tunnels make the smoke and gases of a steam locomotive dangerous, where electric power is plentiful, the steam locomotive must give place to electricity. As the cost of coal mounts, the electrification of railroads will spread and it will be only a matter of time before the electric locomotive, which is far more economical in its use of power, will completely supplant the steam locomotive.\n\nFIRST AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT\nAs we have already noted, the automobile antedated the railway locomotive. It was an accident that took the primitive steam carriage off the high roads and put it on rails. In 1802 Richard Trevithic, while speeding along a road at the frightful speed of ten miles per hour, lost control of his machine, ran into a fence and ripped off a number of palings. That accident spelled the doom of the early automobile. So dangerous a machine was not allowed to run at large. Special tolls and restrictions were placed on power-driven road vehicles. As late as 1896 when the automobile had become a practical machine in France and was being rapidly developed in this country, England still had a law prohibiting any power-propelled vehicle to travel[213] over the highways at a higher speed than four miles per hour and required further that the vehicle be preceded by a man bearing a red flag.\n\nThe most important early American road car was that built by Richard Dudgeon in 1855, which made a record speed of forty miles per hour. In 1889 Serpollet, in France, invented the flash boiler and interest in steam-driven automobiles was revived. In a flash boiler water is turned into steam as it is used by injecting small quantities at a time in a red-hot tube. In the meantime, however, the internal combustion engine was being developed. Lenoir, in France, was the first to build a motor car driven by an internal combustion engine. He obtained a patent on such a vehicle in 1860. However, the real father of the modern automobile was Gottlieb Daimler of Germany, who patented a motor vehicle in 1884 driven by an internal combustion engine. The next year Karl Benz, another German, built an automobile.\n\nAMERICAN PIONEERS OF THE MOTOR CAR\nPioneer work in this country began with Charles E. Duryea in 1891. Five years later he took one of his machines to England, where it entered a fifty-two-mile race between London and Brighton. There were many entrants from France, Germany, and other European countries. The American car won the race by nearly an hour over its nearest competitor. Commercial building of automobiles began in America in 1894. However, it was not until the opening of the twentieth century that America took hold of the motor car in real earnest. Since then the rise of the automobile industry has been phenomenal. American methods of manufacture were applied and cars were turned out in quantity. In 1916 the annual[214] production exceeded a million and to-day the production is about two million passenger cars and over three hundred thousand trucks. The motor car industry is largely responsible for the wonderful progress in American machine tools that has been made in the past two decades.\n\nOn the race track the motor car has established a record speed of 131 miles per hour, but of greater utility has been the motor truck which now competes with railroads in the transportation of freight. Owing to New York\u2019s inadequate terminal facilities, it takes less time to haul a load from New York to Philadelphia by motor truck than to take the same load from the warehouse, transport it across the Hudson River, and load it on a freight car. It has made the country a part of the city. A short run brings the farmer\u2019s produce to the markets and his passenger car keeps him in close touch with city life. The motor tractor has lightened his work on the farm and has enabled him to conduct farming operations over vast areas. Animal power is gradually giving way to mechanical power. This, however, is a special branch of automotive engineering which we must look into.\n\nWHEELS VS. LEGS\nThe success of the automobile depends upon the character of the roads it has to traverse. Wheels provide the best form of transportation over a smooth, hard road, but if the road is soft, the wheel will sink into the surface and will be greatly impeded. In traveling over mud or sand runners are preferable to wheels because they have a broader and longer bearing surface. In the snowy regions of the north and the sandy regions of Africa and Asia[215] Minor, sledges are used in place of wheeled vehicles. Sliding friction is less than rolling friction under such conditions. In fact, only where man has constructed special roads is it possible to use wheeled locomotion. It is because in nature we must contend with all sorts of surface conditions, soft and hard and seldom smooth, that the rolling principle of locomotion is not to be found in any species of animal. The legs of an animal are levers, just as a wheel is a system of levers, but in the former case the levers can be folded or extended to adapt themselves to all the unevennesses of the ground. No animal can begin to run as fast as an automobile on a good road, but on the other hand we have yet to build a machine which will run as fast as a horse on soft and uneven ground.\n\nWALKING MACHINES\nFarm operations must be conducted on loose and broken surfaces for which the ordinary wheeled vehicle is unfitted. In some cases broad wheels are used to keep them from sinking into the soil and they are furnished with cleats so as to give them a good grip on the ground, but long ago it was realized that if the horse was to be completely displaced on the farm a more adaptable form of locomotion than that of wheels must be furnished. Inventors sought to make machines that would walk. One interesting machine of this class which met with a certain degree of success attempted to combine walking and rolling. Large wheels were used which were provided with a series of feet or tread plates connected by knuckle joints to the wheel rims. As the wheels revolved, these treads came successively into contact with the ground and the machine actually[216] walked on its feet. The feet were broad enough to prevent the machine from sinking into the ground and they adapted themselves to inequalities in the surface. Instead of having to roll over a rock that lay in its path the machine would plant its feet on the rock and lift itself over.\n\nA very curious machine of the walking type has been developed for excavating machines that operate in soft swampy ground. The machine actually walks over surfaces that a light carriage could not negotiate. It consists of a large central turntable flanked on each side by a pair of broad and long tread plates which serve as feet. When the dredge is to be moved, it plants the feet on the ground, lifts up the turntable, moves it forward, and sets it down again; then the feet are lifted, moved forward, and planted on the ground again while the turntable is moved forward again. When it is desired to make a turn the machine is swiveled around to the desired direction while sitting on the turntable with its feet raised clear of the ground. Of course the speed of such a machine is very low, but transportation is of secondary consideration. The main purpose of the machine is to excavate ditches in soft ground and only occasionally does it have to move its position. The turntable provides a broad base that distributes the load over a comparatively large area which prevents the machine from sinking into the mud, and if it should sink into a soft spot it lifts itself out vertically instead of having to roll out.\n\n\u201cCATERPILLAR\u201d TRACTION\nLong ago it occurred to inventors that a machine could travel over trackless wastes if they carried their own tracks with them. The idea dates back[217] more than a century, but only in comparatively recent times has it been developed to a practical stage. The track-laying mechanism takes different forms, but in one prominent type it consists of a series of plates linked together to form a chain or belt that passes around a series of wheels. As the machine progresses the plates are successively laid down in front of the wheels and picked up behind them. The wheels consist of a large number of rollers whose axles are spring-supported so that they are capable of a certain amount of vertical movement and as the belt they roll upon is made up of separate plates they can adjust themselves to irregularities of the ground and creep over an uneven surface. Its close resemblance to the creeping locomotion of a caterpillar has led to the adoption of the trade name \u201ccaterpillar\u201d by one of the large tractor manufacturers. The tractor belt is driven by spur wheels at each end and the rollers serve merely to distribute the weight of the machine along the belt. The traction is exceedingly great because the belt is broad and long, giving it a large gripping surface. For the same reason it will not sink into plowed ground. Because of its flexible tread surface it will creep over rocks and stumps, waddle down into a ditch and climb up the opposite bank. So powerful is it that it will crash through underbrush with ease and even small trees yield before it. It will run over soft mud, deep sand, and even snow with equal facility. The tread belts on either side of the tractor are separately driven and by making one belt run faster than the other it is possible to steer the machine. In fact it can be made to turn around in its own length by stopping the belt on one side and driving the belt on the other.\n\n[218]\n\nSuch a machine is ideal for plowing and other are hauled with ease over the soft plowed ground. For ordinary farming purposes speed is not essential, but the possibility of rapid travel with tread-belt traction was demonstrated in the World War when small \u201ctanks\u201d were built which could run at the rate of twelve miles per hour.\n\n[219]\n\nCHAPTER XIV\nINVASION OF THE SKY\n\nFROM the day when man began to assert his superiority over other animals he began to cast longing eyes at the sky. Fired with ambition and stirred with a spirit of mastery he chafed at the bonds that bound him to earth; but the heavens remained a forbidden kingdom to him. Many a bold adventurer who dared to emulate the birds paid the penalty of his temerity with a broken limb and even with his life. It seemed as if man were destined forever to grovel on the bed of the atmospheric ocean with never a chance to rise except in dreams and fancy.\n\nIt was not until near the close of the eighteenth century that a means of rising off the earth was discovered. Two brothers, Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, of Annonay, France, were sitting before a fire, watching the smoke curl up the chimney, when it occurred to one of them that smoke might serve as a vehicle to carry them up into the air. They belonged to a prominent paper-manufacturing family and naturally turned to that material as the most suitable for trapping and harnessing the smoke. They began their experiments with a large bag of thin paper which they filled with smoke and floated up to the ceiling. The next step was to fasten a dish filled with burning embers to the bag, so that the balloon carried its own smoke generator.[220] The experiment was tried in the open air and the balloon arose to a great height. Larger bags were made of linen and paper and on the fifth clay of June, 1782, a public exhibition was given. A pit was dug in the ground in which a fire was lighted and over this was placed a huge balloon which weighed 300 pounds. Eight men were required to hold it down while it was filling with heated air and, when released, it shot up to an elevation of about 6,000 feet and came to earth about a mile and a half away.\n\nTHE FIRST HYDROGEN BALLOON\nWhen the news of this event reached Paris a professor of physics named Charles suggested that hydrogen, being much lighter than air, would raise the balloon without the use of fire. By a popular subscription funds were raised to defray the expenses of securing enough iron filings and sulphuric acid to generate the hydrogen necessary to fill a balloon of 22,000 cubic-foot capacity. On the 27th of August, 1783, a flight was attempted. The big bag arose without mishap and disappeared in the clouds. Three quarters of an hour later it landed in a field fifteen miles away much to the astonishment of the villagers thereabout who gathered around the strange bobbing monster with mingled fear and curiosity. One of the number, more daring than the rest, advanced and shot the balloon, whereupon the crowd closed in and tore it to pieces with their pitchforks.\n\nIn November of the same year the Montgolfier brothers built a balloon 48 feet in diameter and 74 feet high, and Jean Fran\u00e7ois Pilatre de Rozier, a professor of natural history, made several ascents[221] with the balloon held captive. Then, in company with the Marquis d\u2019Arlandes, the balloon was cut loose and the balloon voyage was undertaken. Below the car of the balloon was an iron vessel in which a fire was maintained to furnish the heated air. The aeronauts each carried a bundle of fuel to feed the fire and a wet sponge to extinguish sparks that might ignite the bag. Despite this precaution a number of holes were burnt in the envelope, but nevertheless the flight was successful and the daring voyagers came to earth without mishap after a short journey.\n\nM. de Rozier\u2019s career as an aeronaut was a short one. The first man to be carried up in a balloon, he was also the first balloon victim. He undertook to combine the Montgolfier and the Charles systems by building a balloon that employed both the hot air and the hydrogen principles, but the balloon took fire and De Rozier with his companion, the Marquis de Maisonfort, were both killed. Two months after De Rozier\u2019s first balloon ascension a flight was made at Lyons in a huge fire balloon which carried seven passengers. This big bag was 100 feet in diameter and 130 feet high, with a capacity of 590,000 cubic feet. The invasion of the air was now well under way, although for a time it made little real progress. Owing to the danger of fire, hot air eventually gave way to hydrogen and later to coal gas, which, although it did not have half the lifting power of hydrogen, possessed the advantage of being much cheaper.\n\nTHE WEIGHT OF AIR\nIt seems hardly necessary in this day and generation to explain that a balloon rises because it[222] is lighter than the air it displaces, but it does seem astonishing that a balloon weighing several tons may yet be lighter than an equal volume of air. We do not ordinarily think of air as having any weight. We know that the ocean of air bears on the earth with a pressure of about 14\u00bd pounds per square inch, or about a ton per square foot at sea level. This amounts to 28 millions tons per square mile and, when we multiply this figure by the number of square miles of surface in the total area of the earth, we find that the whole ocean of air has a weight of 5,500,000,000,000,000 tons\u2014a figure which is far beyond our conception, but it does impress us with the fact that air is a ponderable substance. Of course, the atmosphere that exerts a pressure of 14\u00bd pounds per square inch is scores of miles deep, but even a small quantity of air has appreciable weight. If weighed in a vacuum a cubic foot of air would tip the scales at 1\u00bc ounces, and 100 cubic feet would weigh close to 8 pounds. The air in an empty room 10 feet square and with a 10-foot ceiling weighs nearly 80 pounds at a temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, if we had a box measuring 10 feet on each side and weighing less than 80 pounds in a vacuum it would float in the atmosphere when the thermometer was down to the freezing point, provided there was no air in the box to weigh it down.\n\nVacuum balloons were proposed long before the time of the Montgolfier, but the problem was to construct a vessel strong enough to resist the crushing pressure of the atmosphere. The best bracing for the walls of the vessel is some gas dense enough to exert a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere but whose weight is less than that of the air. The[223] weight of the vessel must then not exceed the difference between the weight of the gas and an equal volume of air. The Montgolfier brothers used heated air to keep their box or envelope distended. Air expanded by heat is lighter than cold air. However, it does not make a very good filler because 1,000 cubic feet of air heated to 212 degrees Fahrenheit weighs 59 pounds, leaving only 21 pounds on a freezing cold day for the absolute weight of our 1,000-cubic-foot box. Coal gas, on the other hand, weighs about 40 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, while the same volume of hydrogen weighs only 5\u00bd pounds. If coal gas were used to brace our box against the pressure of the air we should have a surplus of about 40 pounds for the weight of the box, while hydrogen would allow us 74\u00bd pounds. Of course, the weight of a volume of gas depends upon its density. No matter how small a weight of gas we placed in the box it would fill the box completely, but when we speak of a 1,000 cubic feet of gas or hydrogen we mean a volume sufficiently dense to bear against the container with the same pressure that the atmosphere presses outside; i. e., 14\u00bd pounds per square inch. Temperature also affects the pressure. In the case of fire balloons the hot air inside the envelope is less dense and hence lighter than cool air outside, but the pressure is equal because the former is expanded by heat. The volume of gas in a hydrogen or coal-gas balloon varies greatly with the temperature to which it is subjected. For instance, if on rising through a cloud or a blanket of fog, the balloon should encounter the rays of the sun, the heat would burst open the envelope were no vent provided. The mouth of[224] the bag is kept open, however, for just such emergencies so that the surplus gas may escape. On the other hand, sudden chilling of the gas will contract it and send it down to earth, or the balloon might encounter a downward current of air, when the only salvation of the aeronaut is to throw out the ballast.\n\nBALLOON NAVIGATION\nBalloons seem like very helpless craft, and yet they are capable of skillful navigation at the hands of an experienced pilot. Although the balloonist has no means of self-propulsion and must drift with the winds, he is capable of controlling motion in the vertical direction and can choose the particular air currents on which he desires to ride. By throwing out sand ballast the bag may be made to rise and by letting out the gas it may be made to descend, and a pilot who is familiar with prevailing currents of the atmosphere or able to interpret meteorological indications, may locate the air stream that will carry him to his destination. Sand is the balloonist\u2019s fuel; when that is gone the balloon may as well come to earth at once. Its course can no longer be directed and there is nothing to prevent it from being suddenly dashed to earth should it run into an \u201cair hole,\u201d which is another name for a downward air current. When a balloon comes to earth it is liable to be dragged by the wind and many accidents from dragging occurred in the early days of aeronautics until John Wise, an American, invented the rip panel by which the envelope may be ripped open by pulling a cord, thus freeing the gas and permitting the bag to collapse instantly.\n\n\nA LOOM PROVIDED WITH A JACQUARD ATTACHMENT\n\nNote the belt of cards that determine the pattern that is to be woven\n\n\nA BATTERY OF MULE-SPINNING FRAMES\n\n\nJACQUARD ATTACHMENT FOR LOOMS\n\n[225]\n\nSEVEN MILES ABOVE THE EARTH\nThe greatest altitude ever attained by a balloon has been claimed for Glaisher and Coxwell, who in 1862 went up to a height of seven miles. Both men were overcome by the extreme rarity of the atmosphere. Coxwell, however, although nearly paralyzed and unable to move his arms, succeeded in seizing the safety valve rope in his teeth and pulled it before he lost consciousness. The balloon was then at an altitude of 29,000 feet and rising at the rate of 1,000 feet per minute. Thirteen minutes elapsed before he regained his senses, and then the balloon was falling at the rate of 2,000 feet per minute. From the data furnished, it has been estimated that an altitude of 37,000 feet was reached. While there has been much dispute as to the authenticity of this record, the altitude of 35,100 feet established in 1901 by Professor Berson and Dr. Suring in the German balloon Preussen, probably represents a higher ascent than that of Glaisher\u2019s balloon.\n\nThe new system of aerial transportation proved very useful in the nineteenth century. During the siege of Paris, in 1870-1871, sixty-six balloons arose out of the beleaguered city, and all but seven made their escape in safety. In our own Civil War captive balloons were first used to direct the fire of artillery. It was in one of these balloons that Friedrich von Zeppelin, who was a German military attach\u00e9 with the Union forces, made his first aerial ascent. He was so impressed with the advantages of military observation from such a lofty aerie that he became from that moment an aeronautical enthusiast, and on his return to Germany urged upon the military authorities the importance[226] of the balloon in war. It was then that he began his aeronautic studies and experiments which culminated in the construction of the gigantic ships of the air with which Germany undertook to carry the terror of war into England.\n\nKITE BALLOONS\nIn the World War captive balloons were extensively used by both sides, an important development being the kite balloon. The common spherical captive balloon is very unsteady except in perfectly still air. It bobs around and swings and turns, making an unfavorable base for careful observation. In heavy winds it is liable to be dashed to earth by sudden gusts. The kite balloon is held up not only by its own buoyancy, but also by the wind in the same way that a kite is supported. The bag is elongated (sausage-shaped) and is fastened to the anchor line in such a way that it is tilted like a kite. To assist in holding it in this position the balloon is ballasted at the after end and the ballast, if you please, is air. A big air-filled bag hangs from the stern of the balloon and serves as a rudder while two other horizontal bags serve as stabilizing fins.\n\nSELF-PROPELLED BALLOONS\nNo sooner had the Montgolfier brothers proved that it was possible to rise off the earth upon a bubble of hot air, than inventors began to devise schemes of propelling the bubble and controlling its course. The first dirigible balloon was built in 1784 and, strangely enough, oars were used to propel it. The balloon had a fish-shaped body, just like that of modern airships, and the bag was kept[227] inflated by means of air as it is to-day. It was realized even at that early date that the envelope must retain its shape if it is to plow through the air with a minimum of friction. As the gas would gradually leak out of the envelope the bag would become flabby and present a crumpled bow to the ocean of the air and, to overcome this, a double envelope was provided and air was introduced between the inner and outer skin. Means were provided for pumping air in as the gas slowly escaped, thus keeping the envelope fully inflated. As the air was pumped in sand ballast was thrown overboard so that the buoyancy of the airship was not impaired. To-day air is used to keep gas envelopes inflated, but instead of placing the air in an outside envelope it is introduced into a small bag inside called a \u201cballonet.\u201d\n\nFrom time to time other means of propulsion were proposed and tried. In 1852 Henri Giffard, who is known as the Fulton of aerial navigation, built and operated a dirigible driven by a steam engine, which he hung at a considerable distance below the gas bag, so that the fire box would not be liable to ignite the highly inflammable gas. A draft was maintained in the fire box as it is in a locomotive by letting the steam discharge into the smoke stack, but in this case the stack was inverted and the smoke and gases were blown downward and away from the coal gas with which the balloon was inflated. The danger of fire and the difficulty of building a power plant light enough to be carried aloft and powerful enough to give the craft any material headway were the chief obstacles that had to be overcome. At the close of the nineteenth century, Santos Dumont, a Brazilian inventor,[228] built a balloon that was driven by a gasoline engine. Despite the apprehension of other aeronauts this machine proved an unqualified success. Two years later, in 1900, Count Zeppelin introduced the rigid dirigible, which to-day is the standard for large airships.\n\nTHREE TYPES OF DIRIGIBLES\nThere are three types of dirigible airships; the flexible, the semirigid, and the rigid. In the flexible type, as we have observed, the envelope must be kept tightly filled in order to hold its shape when driven against the air. The car is suspended from the gas bag. In the semirigid type a rigid frame or backbone serves as a keel for the gasbag and helps to prevent it from crumpling up. In the rigid type a casing incloses the gas or rather bags; for the gas Is contained in a number of separate bags fitted into separate compartments. The casing is composed of a framework of duralumin, which is an alloy of aluminum, with a percentage of copper and nickel. It weighs but little more than aluminum, but is five times as strong. Over the duralumin framework is stretched a sheathing of rubberized fabric. Because of the weight of this casing rigid dirigibles must be made in large size.\n\nACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN A DIRIGIBLE\nBefore the war large Zeppelins were built that were fitted with luxurious cabins and dining rooms and made regular scheduled voyages. The big British dirigibles are of the Zeppelin type. The R-34, was 672 feet long and 79 feet in diameter. It was fitted with nineteen gas bags and had a total capacity[229] of over two million cubic feet of hydrogen. It was driven by five engines, each developing from 250 to 275 horsepower, and was capable of making from 50 to 75 miles per hour, depending upon whether or not the engines were pushed. The big dirigible left the Royal Naval Air Station, near Edinburgh, on the 2d of July, 1919, and landed at the Roosevelt Field near Mineola on the 6th, having made the trip in four days and two hours. The course covered about 3,100 sea miles, but the actual air mileage was about 6,300 miles because head winds were encountered. In aeronautic voyages it is the distance through the air that must be reckoned rather than the distance over the ground or sea. An airship may be traveling at the rate of 50 miles per hour through the air, but if there is a wind of 30 miles per hour blowing against the course of the dirigible, the latter will be making only 20 miles per hour over the ground, or if the wind is blowing with the airship it will be making 80 miles per hour over the ground. Because of the head winds the transatlantic flight of the R-34 was so much longer than had been anticipated that its stores of fuel were almost completely exhausted. And yet, when the airship started out from Edinburgh, it carried 81 tanks of gasoline, each containing nearly 70 gallons, or a total of 4,900 gallons. This fuel weighed nearly 16 tons. Almost a ton of oil and 3 tons of water added to the load and the baggage and crew amounted to 4 tons more. The total weight carried was over 24 tons and the dirigible fully loaded weighed altogether about 60 tons. When the dirigible started out it had to fly low, but as the fuel was consumed it grew lighter and rose higher. The surplus hydrogen had to be pumped[230] into steel tanks where, owing to its compression, it was heavy and served as ballast which could at any time be fed back into the gas bags to increase the buoyancy of the airship. We can no longer think of air as having no weight when we consider that all this tonnage was supported by air.\n\nThe R-34 was by no means the largest dirigible built, but we dare not boast of the size of the airships of to-day when the aeronautics is in its in-fancy, because our present dirigibles may seem puny alongside the big aircraft that may be built to-morrow. The dimensions of the R-34 have been given because of the historic interest in this first dirigible to span the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHEAVIER-THAN-AIR MACHINES\nMarvelous as was the achievement of the Montgolfiers and wonderful as were the aeronautic developments that followed the invention of the balloon, the dominion of the birds was not really conquered until man had learned how to fly in a machine heavier than the air. Captive aeroplanes date back to the remote ages of ancient history. Kites are really \u201cheavier-than-air machines.\u201d They maintain themselves in the air because they travel through the air at a considerable velocity. True, a kite may be stationary, or practically so with respect to the ground, but if we detach ourselves from the ground and view the situation from a drifting balloon, the earth will appear to be moving under us and the kite will rush past us as it is dragged by the earth to which it is tied. The idea of propelling a kite through the air, not by tying it to the earth, but by furnishing it with its own propeller and power plant, was conceived long[231] ago, but the problem was to find a power plant light enough. The honor of being the first man to rise off the ground in an aeroplane belongs to C. Ader, who made several short flights between 1890 and 1896 in a machine driven by a twenty-horsepower steam engine. Our own S. P. Langley did some most important pioneer work in flying and built a man-lifting, steam-driven machine in 1903 which would have flown had it not been for an accident to its launching gear. In fact, this very model was flown successfully a number of years later. However, it was not until the gasoline engine was developed that the power plant problem was solved. The internal-combustion motor was made more and more powerful in proportion to its weight until now there are several types that weigh less than two pounds per horsepower.\n\nBut the power plant was only one obstacle to be overcome. The real problem was to learn how to control the machine after it rose into the air. Otto Lilienthal attempted to learn how to fly in a motorless flying machine. He provided himself with wings and, jumping off a height or running down a slope, depended upon gravity to furnish him with the necessary propulsion through the air. Unfortunately after five years of gliding experiments a fatal accident terminated his aeronautic research.\n\nTHE WRIGHT BROTHERS\nIn this country the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, took up the work of Lilienthal and they, too, undertook to learn to fly before they built a flying machine. In all his years of experiment, Lilienthal did not have more than five hours of experience in the air. The Wright brothers determined[232] to spend more time in the air and less in theoretical speculations at home, so they built a gliding machine that would sustain a man at a speed of eighteen miles per hour and picked out a spot on the Atlantic coast where they were assured of fairly constant winds of sixteen to twenty-five miles per hour. At first the machine was used as a kite and various experiments were made in balancing it. Then short gliding flights were made from the tops of the sand dunes. Not until the art of balancing the glider and controlling it in unsteady air currents was any attempt made at building a motor-driven flying machine. It was by these experiments that the Wright brothers discovered the system of warping the wings so as to preserve the lateral balance of the machine. After several seasons of experimental gliding, and not until they felt that they had learned how to fly, was a power machine built. This made its first flight on December 17, 1903. The first flight lasted only twelve seconds, while the fourth flight lasted fifty-nine seconds. Many months were spent in perfecting the machine and in solving the various problems of flight, and not until September, 1905, did the Wright brothers feel that they had mastered the art of flying. After that three years elapsed before the world was actually convinced of the reality of airplane flight and recognized the work of the pioneers.\n\nTRANSATLANTIC AEROPLANE FLIGHTS\nThe development of the heavier-than-air machine is so recent and is still advancing so rapidly that we dare not give more than a brief outline of its progress here. The more important advances are familiar to most of us and a record of achievements[233] to-day will be hopelessly out of date to-morrow. The war gave a tremendous impetus to flying. Pilots were trained by the thousand. Machines grew in speed up to 150 miles per hour. Huge bombing machines were built, with a wing spread of over 125 feet, and weighing ten to fifteen tons. These were capable of carrying a load of four to five tons. The first flight across the Atlantic was made in June, 1919, by the United States navy flying boat NC-4, which flew to Newfoundland, then to the Azores, and from there to Lisbon, Portugal. The trip was finally completed by a flight to Plymouth, England.\n\nThe first nonstop flight was made in the same month by a Vickers Vimy bomber which, with a favoring wind of thirty miles per hour, made the trip in less than eighteen hours at a rate of 120 miles per hour. To-day all-metal aeroplanes are being flown successfully. Plans are under way to build aeroplanes for service at extremely high altitudes, where greater speeds are possible owing to the tenuity of the air and the consequent lowering of head resistance. These machines are to have inclosed bodies in which air at normal pressure will be maintained by means of blowers. The blowers would also furnish the engines with air necessary for proper combustion of the fuel.\n\nWe are not going to give a history of the progress of aviation since the invention of the Wright biplane, but instead we shall look briefly and in a very elementary way into the principles underlying the flight of heavier-than-air machines.\n\nWHY A KITE STAYS UP\nWhat is it that makes a plane or a kite stay in the air? The answer is inertia. The balloon shows us that[234] air possesses weight; the aeroplane shows us that air possesses inertia. This is a natural consequence. Every body possesses inertia and the heavier the body the greater its inertia. By inertia we mean resistance to change of motion or rest. The pressure of air against the face of a fan is due to its resistance to a change from state of rest to a state of motion, while the pressure of wind against a surface represents the resistance of air in motion to being brought to a state of rest. The more sudden the change the higher is the resistance or pressure developed. If an open newspaper be laid over one half of a ruler, while the other half extends beyond the edge of the table, the ruler may be broken by a sharp blow on the overhanging end, not because the other end is held down by the weight of the newspaper, but because the inertia of the air bearing on the broad area of the paper prevents the ruler under the paper from rising in response to the sudden blow at the overhanging end. It is the inertia of the air, i. e., its resistance to rapid displacement that keeps a parachute from falling like a solid shot to earth.\n\nFigure 62 shows how a kite is maintained in the air. The line AB represents the plane of the kite, the line CO at right angles to this plane is the pressure against the center of the kite surface. The wind pressure DO is resisted by the pull of the kite string and exerts a lift EO, which resists the vertical pull of gravity. The sum of the forces DO and EO must be equal to the force CO. If EO is greater than the force of gravity the kite will rise, and if it is less the kite will fall. The magnitude of the force EO depends upon the velocity of the wind DO and the angle of the kite AB to the wind. If the plane of the kite were parallel to the[235] direction of the wind the angle would be zero and the lift would also be zero.\n\nFORCES THAT SUPPORT AN AEROPLANE\n\nFIG. 62.\u2014FORCES WHICH HOLD UP A KITE\n\nIn an aeroplane conditions are just the same as in a kite, except that a propeller drives the plane through the air with a force equal to CO. The plane is slightly curved, so that air which is deflected or forced down at the forward edge will continue to press against the plane all the way to the rear edge. The shape of the top of the plane is also important. As the plane is driven through the air a partial vacuum is formed above the plane, so that the difference in pressure between the two sides is increased and there is a greater lifting effect. This partial vacuum is known as \u201ccavitation.\u201d In the early days of the aeroplane it was not realized how important was the effect of cavitation on rapidly moving objects. Every spar and member of the[236] airplane as it plows through the air builds up a head resistance in front and is followed by a wake of rarefied air unless it is given a stream-line construction. This is illustrated in Figure 63, which shows at the left a rectangular body traveling through the air and at the right a stream-lined body. The flow of the air is indicated by the lines and it is evident that head resistance and cavitation are reduced by forming the body with a bulging bow and tapering stern. To-day all the exposed parts of aeroplanes are stream-lined as far as possible. In the early Wright machines wire braces were extensively used. It was not supposed that a wire would offer much resistance to the air, but, upon investigation, it was found that the wire braces would vibrate laterally and present virtually a broad surface which materially increased the head resistance.\n\n\nFIG. 63.\u2014FLOW OF AIR AROUND A RECTANGULAR BODY AND A STREAM-LINED BODY\n\nThe angle of the plane determines to a large extent the head resistance of the plane. If the plane is horizontal the head resistance is at a minimum, but the lift is also very slight. If the wing planes were perfectly flat, there would be no lift at all, but because of the curve of the wings there is a certain amount of lift when they are horizontal, and even when they are tipped slightly downward, provided[237] the machine is traveling at high speed. The angle of an aeroplane\u2019s wings is therefore much flatter than that of a kite.\n\nMAINTAINING THE EQUILIBRIUM OF AN AEROPLANE\nIn order to maintain itself in equilibrium the center of gravity must coincide with the center of pressure, otherwise there will be a turning action about the center of gravity and the machine will upset. The location of the center of pressure depends upon the angle of the plane. The greater the angle the farther it is from the forward edge of the plane and the pilot can maintain fore-and-aft equilibrium by tilting the horizontal planes of his rudder so as to change the angle of the machine, and hence of the main or forward planes. Unfortunately the air is a turbulent ocean filled with invisible air currents and the aeroplane must be capable of adjustment to meet the variations of pressure due to sudden gusts of wind. This is particularly true of lateral balance. A gust coming from the side will put a greater pressure on one side of the aeroplane than on the other. To meet this the angle of the plane at one side must be less than that at the other. This was discovered by the Wright brothers and their method of overcoming the lateral variations of pressure was the key to their early success. They warped their wings or twisted them so that the angle of the wing was reduced on the side from which the gust came and was increased on the other, and thus the center of pressure over the whole wing was kept on the line of the center of gravity. At the same time there was a variation in head resistance which had to be[238] corrected by moving the rudder, and the Wright brothers used a single lever to warp the wings and at the same time to operate the rudder so as to keep the aeroplane on its course.\n\nBefore the Wright brothers made public their invention other aeronauts had great difficulty in making turns. When turning, one side naturally has to move through the air faster than the other. This produces an increase of pressure on one side over the other which may be counterbalanced by warping the wings. The same effect is produced by the use of small wing planes, called \u201cailerons,\u201d at each side of the main planes. An automatic means of stabilizing an aeroplane has also been devised, a description of which will be found in Chapter XXI.\n\n[239]\n\nCHAPTER XV\nHELPING THE FARMER\n\nTHE FIRST efforts at directing the forces of nature and employing them in the service of man were made by the farmer. The task of growing food was quite the most important of primitive occupations, and although the virgin soil was rich and the yield abundant there were regions where crops could not be raised except at the expense of constant toil. Infrequent rains made it necessary to carry water by hand from wells and rivers and pour it over thirsty lands. As the grain fields grew more extensive, irrigating ditches were used which saved the toil of carrying the water, although it still had to be raised by hand. Then machines were invented by which water could be raised by animal power and, finally, as we have already seen, automatic water-lifting machines were constructed by which the river itself was constrained to lift a part of itself and pour this part into the irrigation ditches.\n\nWhile it is true that the earliest machines were built to lighten the work of the farmer, the attention of inventors was soon attracted to other fields of endeavor and the farmer was left to toil slavishly from daybreak to sundown with no further mechanical aid. The tools he used were improved in form and quality. Oxen were used to draw the plow. The wooden plow made out of a forked stick[240] gave way to a bronze plow and, finally, to one of iron. The curved knife or sickle went through a similar process of evolution from flint to iron. It was the only implement used for cutting the standing grain, and not until comparatively recent times did it give way to the scythe. Practically all the work of tilling, seeding, cultivating, harvesting and threshing was done by hand in practically the same way and with practically the same tools from the time of the Pharaohs down to the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nTHE FIRST HARVESTING MACHINE\nTo be sure, there is a record of a harvesting machine built in Gaul, while that province was under Roman dominion. Pliny described this machine in 70 A. D. It consisted of an ox cart which was pushed through a field of grain, instead of being pulled by the ox. This cart carried a rack or comb which caught the heads of the standing grain, tearing them off and delivering them into the body of the cart. Unfortunately this primitive, but useful, harvester was not extensively employed and in time it was lost to agriculture. Farmers reverted to the time-honored method of reaping by hand and the ox-pushed machine was forgotten. From time to time in recent years this machine has been reinvented and a machine similar in principle is used to-day to gather clover seed.\n\nThe scythe was a distinct improvement over the sickle. It enabled a man to use two hands at the work of reaping instead of one. It provided a much longer and heavier blade, and hence a much broader swath was cut at each stroke. A distinctly American improvement on the scythe is the grain cradle, consisting of a set of fingers above the blade[241] which catch the grain and lay it in a swath at the end of the stroke. This important improvement rapidly spread to all parts of the world and is still used to-day where it is impracticable to use a mechanical reaper. It is claimed that one man can cut and bind more grain with the cradle than three men could with the sickle.\n\nEVOLUTION OF THE PLOW\nThe plow has undergone important developments in comparatively recent years. Wooden plows were still in use in America in Revolutionary times; usually the point was shod with wrought iron. However, these wooden plows speedily gave way to metal when iron came to be manufactured in considerable quantity in this country. A plow has to contend with two conditions of service that apparently conflict with each other. The constant friction of the soil against the blade tends to wear it away very rapidly, hence a very hard surface is requisite. On the other hand, the plow is apt to encounter buried stones and rocks which will shatter it unless it is soft. The problem then is to make the plow both hard and soft. The chilled iron plow was invented by Oliver, in 1855, to meet the first condition. When molten iron is poured into an iron mold the surface that comes into contact with the mold is suddenly chilled, producing a very hard surface that takes a good polish. This effect is accentuated by using a hollow mold through which water is circulated. The hard surface of the chilled iron wears well in sandy and gravelly soil, it does not rust deeply, and it clears well in sticky soil. However, it is very brittle and is liable to break if struck a sharp blow. A more recent improvement[242] is the soft-center steel plow. This is both hard and soft. It is composed of three layers of metal; the outer layers are of hard cast steel and the center one of soft steel. These metal layers are heated to a welding heat and then rolled together, producing a plow that has a hard outer wearing surface and at the same time is tough because the center layer of soft steel acts as a cushion to absorb sharp blows. To increase the wearing qualities of the plow still further a patch of very hard cast steel is welded over the point of the share. Thus both conflicting requirements of softness and extreme hardness are met.\n\nWe think of the plow as a very simple tool, but the modern implement is a product resulting from a vast amount of study and research into the materials most suitable for its construction and into the best form of share and moldboard. In place of a single plow for all purposes the modern farmer is offered a large assortment to suit various classes of work. At least three different kinds of plows are indispensable on every farm; the sod plow, the stubble plow, and the corn-cultivating plow. The sod plow is used for turning over the sod and breaking the clod. This is provided with a jointer or diminutive plow point set above the share, which turns over the edge of the furrow to prevent grass from growing up between the furrows. The stubble plow has a moldboard with less twist than that of the sod plow. This is used for plowing land that was under cultivation during the previous year.\n\nThe plow of to-day has become more than a hand-guided, horse-drawn tool. It has developed into a real machine, mounted on wheels, with a disk or coulter wheel that cuts the furrow cleanly, means[243] for leveling the plow and regulating the depth of the plow, and a seat for the plowman. It works upon soil with the same precision that a planer works upon a slab of cast iron. The furrow is neatly sliced, lifted, and turned over with mechanical accuracy. As the furrow slice slides over the moldboard of the plow the soil is pulverized by friction. The front furrow wheel runs in the furrow previously cut which serves as a track to guide the machine. The front and rear furrow wheels are inclined from the vertical so as to balance the thrust of the plow and they may be given a lead toward or from the \u201cland\u201d or unplowed part of the ground to regulate the steering automatically. The proper adjustment and balancing of a plow calls for considerable skill.\n\nAgricultural operations are now conducted on such a vast scale that the single plow cannot begin to do the necessary work. Instead, sets of gang plows are used so that from a dozen to two dozen furrows may be turned at a time. Steam or gasoline tractors of the wheel or track-laying type are required to furnish the tractive effort needed to haul these huge plows. The larger tractors are so powerful that they haul not only the plow but a harrow behind the plow to break up the clods and a seeder behind the harrow to sow and cover the seed so that all three operations are performed simultaneously.\n\nThe disk type of plow is used in very dry and hard soil and also in very sticky soil. A rolling disk takes the place of the moldboard and share, and in this way friction is reduced very materially, with the result that less tractive effort is required to draw the machine.\n\n[244]\n\nThere is scarcely any agricultural operation for which a machine has not been designed. We cannot attempt to describe them all. For tilling the soil there are plows, harrows, drags, and rollers of many different varieties; for seeding and planting there are grain and seed drills, corn planters, potato planters, etc.; for cultivating or working the growing crops there are cultivators, weeders, fertilizer drills, corn plows, etc.; and for harvesting or gathering the crops there are mowers, hay rakes and tedders, reapers and binders, potato diggers, corn binders and huskers, corn shellers, etc.\n\nINVENTION OF THE REAPER\nMost interesting of all are the reapers because they represent the first successful efforts to introduce machinery into farming operations. Toward the close of the eighteenth century the Royal Agricultural Society of England offered a prize for the invention of a successful reaper, which stimulated inventive effort in this field. But although many patents on reaping machines were granted by the British patent office, nothing was produced that completely met the requirements. In fact even as late as 1851 when a World\u2019s Fair was held in London the British had no really successful reaper to exhibit. In the meantime, American inventors had been at work and two inventors in particular, Obed Hussey of Maryland and Cyrus McCormick of Virginia, had developed machines which had so far proved their worth that they were extensively used on American farms. These two inventors, working independently, produced machines that were very similar in basic principles. As our patent regulations of that period did not call for an extensive[245] search of the prior art there was no official investigation to show which was entitled to the honor of priority of basic principles or whether both did not include in their applications much that was old. Hussey filed his patent on the last day of 1833 and McCormick in June of 1834.\n\nThe main stumblingblocks of earlier inventors of reaping and mowing machines was in finding a suitable method of cutting the grain. Revolving combs for tearing off the heads of grain, fingers for gathering the grain and holding it against a revolving cutter, horizontally reciprocating knives\u2014all these methods were tried without success. Nearly three years before Hussey obtained his patent, Manning, of Plainfield, New Jersey, solved the problem by inventing a reciprocating cutter with spear-shaped blades cooperating with a finger bar that guided and held the grain against the blades. This invention was apparently unknown to either Hussey or McCormick and their patents show cutting means that were broadly the same as that of Manning.\n\nTHE \u201cFULTON\u201d OF AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY\nOf the two rivals, McCormick showed the better business ability in perfecting his invention and promoting it so that he eventually became to be considered the \u201cFulton\u201d of agricultural machinery and the public forgot the pioneer work of Hussey. As a matter of fact, McCormick built his first successful reaper three years before he obtained his patent. Four horses were hitched to the machine and he went out into a neighboring field of oats to demonstrate it. In less than half a day he had reaped six acres, which was a remarkable performance[246] when we consider that a single acre was considered a day\u2019s work for one man. McCormick\u2019s machine had a reel above the cutter to hold the grain against the knife and as the grain was cut it dropped upon a platform. A man walked alongside the machine and removed the grain with a rake. And so the reaper with two men to operate it did the work that had formerly required twelve men with the cradle.\n\nThe next important improvement was to provide a seat at one side of the reaper so that the man with the rake could ride. While this reduced the labor of the man it did not materially increase the efficiency of the machine. The next step, however, was of material importance. In place of raking off the hay by hand an automatic rake was furnished and the services of the extra man were dispensed with. One man could then do the work of twelve. McCormick had had difficulty in introducing his machine into public use, but now its superiority over hand labor was so marked that reapers came to be extensively employed on American farms. The reaper had reached this stage of its development when the World\u2019s Fair of 1851 was held in London and McCormick\u2019s machine was sent across the Atlantic to be displayed at the exhibition. At the same time Hussey sent over one of his machines which had reached the same stage of development. There was a British machine also on exhibition based on the invention of Rev. Patrick Bell of Scotland in 1826, but in a competition with the American machines it could not begin to compare in efficiency. The work of the American machines was a revelation to the British farmers. The prize was carried off by McCormick\u2019s machine, which was declared by the judges[247] to be worth the whole cost of the exposition. Unfortunately Hussey was not on hand to direct the operation of his machine, which may have had something to do with its failure, for in another test the Hussey reaper was found superior to the McCormick.\n\nThe excellence of American reapers was now well established and their fame spread throughout Europe. In a competitive test held near Paris in 1855, America won the highest honors by cutting an acre of oats in twenty-two minutes as against sixty-six minutes for a British machine and seventy-two for an Algerian machine. In 1878 McCormick was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences in honor of his achievements.\n\nTYING KNOTS BY MACHINE\nAfter the self-raker was introduced the next important improvement was in the binding of the grain. At first the cut grain was raked into a receptacle which was dumped by the driver of the machine when enough had accumulated to form a bundle and the bundles were bound by men following the machine. As in the evolution of the raker, the next step was to provide a platform for these men on the machine so that they could ride as they bound the grain and finally in 1873 a self-binding attachment was invented which increased the efficiency of the machine manifold. This self-binder, however, called for the use of wire which did not meet with favor as a binding material because of the difficulty of cutting it without a special tool. Efforts were therefore made to introduce twine instead. But twine cannot be fastened by mere twisting; it has to be tied and a mechanical means of tying a knot was far from an easy problem to[248] solve. While it is true that the human body is a machine and every movement of which it is capable may be reproduced by mechanical means, the difficulty is to copy many operations without involving such complexity of members as to make the mechanism wholly impracticable. The human hand is really a very intricate piece of mechanism which by long generations of evolution and development has become wonderfully deft. It exhibits this deftness and complexity of movement in tying knots and the very intricacy of this operation was enough to baffle the majority of inventors. There was one inventor, however, who was not to be thwarted even by so formidable an obstacle as this. In 1864 Jacob Behel secured a patent on an attachment for binders which would actually tie a knot. The mechanism passed the twine around the gavel of grain, formed a loop in the two ends, and tied a simple overhand knot in much the same way that the hand ties this knot. Ten years later Marquis L. Gorham improved the mechanism and built a successful twine binder. Finally in 1879 John F. Appleby perfected the binding mechanism, completing the last stage in the development of the modern automatic self-binding reaper.\n\nTo keep pace with the reaper, other agricultural machines had to be invented and developed. The vast quantity of grain harvested could not be threshed by hand and the old-fashioned flail had to give way to the steam-driven threshing machine. Finally to meet the requirements of the vast western wheat fields, the combined harvester and thresher was developed which, with a crew of four men, will reap, thresh, and bag between two and three thousand bushels per day. According to statistics[249] of the U. S. Department of Agriculture it took a man three hours and a half to produce a bushel of wheat in 1830 as against ten minutes in 1896. Surely the world owes a tremendous debt to Hussey and particularly to McCormick for introducing machinery into agriculture and starting the train of inventions which in the space of two-thirds of a century have led up to the present remarkable era of machine farming.\n\nThere still remains one task of the farmer that has not yet been accomplished with unqualified success by machine. The harvesting of the corn crop is a tedious and disagreeable task and one which the farmer would only too gladly turn over to the machine. To be sure, many corn-harvesting machines have been built and put into service with more or less success, but none has reached the perfection of other classes of agricultural machinery. The difficulty lies not in the machine, but in the fact that corn is so easily beaten down by storms that at harvest time the machine seldom finds the stalks all standing up in nice straight rows. Machines must therefore be provided with means for lifting up the fallen stalks to vertical position. The stalks are cut and bound into bundles and stood up in shocks.\n\nEven more difficult than cutting and binding is the task of husking the corn. This work was always dreaded by farm hands, but now machines are provided to husk the ears and shred the stalks for fodder. Thus the farm is being relieved of its drudgery. Unfortunately it is only the large western farms that can afford to avail themselves of the latest agricultural machinery. On small eastern farms it does not pay to purchase a machine which can be used for only a few weeks in the year and then must[250] be stored away until the next season, but small farmers are now cooperating and clubbing together to buy the less frequently used machines and so even the small farm is being relieved of its drudgery, and the arduous burdens which have always had a tendency to drive young men away from the farm are now being assumed by the unfeeling machine.\n\n[251]\n\nCHAPTER XVI\nMACHINING THE EARTH\n\nTHE ALBANIAN people have a story that the Creator recently visited the earth and was astonished to find how it had changed. \u201cWhy, this is not the earth I created,\u201d He said. \u201cEverything has changed. My forests are cut down; My rivers have been diverted from their courses; My hills have been blasted away, and My mountains have been robbed of their minerals. The whole face of the earth has been altered.\u201d But in the course of His roamings, the Creator suddenly came upon the land of Albania. \u201cAh!\u201d He exclaimed in delight. \u201cHere is a bit of earth untouched by man. It is still just as I made it.\u201d\n\nMan\u2019s ambition to make over the face of the earth to his own liking dates far back of the present age of machinery. However, the work of the ancient engineer was accomplished only at the expense of decades and generations of hard manual labor. To-day, with powerful and gigantic machinery to do our bidding, we do not hesitate to change the course of rivers, to level off the hills, to carve highways through the mountains and pierce them with tunnels, to bore into their depths for treasure and drive deep holes into the bowels of the earth in quest of liquid fuel. We are able to machine the earth in much the same way as a piece of metal is machined in the machine shop. In fact, the drill,[252] the circular saw, the slotter, and even the milling machine have their counterpart in the excavating machinery of to-day. Of course we cannot expect to find the counterpart of such machines as the lathe, boring mill, and planer, in which the work revolves against the tool, because this planet of ours is rather too big a piece of stock to be placed between lathe centers or to be bolted to a planer bed.\n\nMECHANICAL MONSTERS\nThe twentieth century finds this planet again stocked with monsters larger and more powerful than the gigantic saurians that dominated the earth in the Jurassic and Cretaceous epochs, but our mighty fire-breathing, steel-sinewed beasts are humbly subservient to the will of man.\n\nThe spectacle of a large steam shovel at work makes one feel at once very small and very big. Before the work of this monster the human shoveler shrinks to the proportions of a mere insect. Seven to eight cubic yards shoveled into a cart is considered a fair day\u2019s work for a laborer, but a big steam shovel can easily gobble up as much material in two bites. However, when we contemplate that this mammoth machine is a human creation and an absolute slave to human command, we are rather inclined to be puffed up with the greatness of man.\n\nSteam shovels are ideal machines for excavating railroad cuts and were primarily developed for just such work. The general operation of the machine is very similar to that of hand shoveling. The shovel proper consists of a big scoop or dipper and a dipper handle which correspond respectively to the blade and handle of a hand shovel. Like the[253] shovel, the dipper is supported at two points. The dipper is suspended by a chain from the end of a boom while the handle of the dipper is also supported in the boom. By loosening the hoisting chain the dipper is lowered to the ground, and by moving the handle forward the toothed cutting edge is made to bite into the ground or sand bank. The hoisting chain then hauls up the dipper, making it scoop out the bank, after which it is swung to one side over a car on an adjoining track. The rear of the bucket is fitted with a door which is opened by a spring latch and the contents are emptied out. Some of the largest steam shovels for ordinary grading have dippers with a capacity of 5 cubic yards. They are not confined to railroad grading, but are applicable to any excavation where a firm footing is provided for the heavy machine. They are even used for excavating the cellars of large city buildings. The machine must be supported on road wheels or on skids. When used for excavating sewer trenches, it is sometimes mounted on a platform spanning the trench. However, the steam shovel is rather limited in its reach. The largest ordinary steam shovels have a clear lift of but sixteen feet and can make a cut only sixty feet wide at the top.\n\nFor more extensive excavating as well as for digging ditches and trenches the drag-line excavator has recently come in to use. In these machines a scraper takes the place of the dipper. This is suspended from the end of a long crane and it is dragged along the ground by a cable, scooping up a load of earth. In some cases the scoop or scraper is merely attached to a cable leading from the hoisting engine to an anchorage and back to the engine.[254] To adapt excavating machines for service in soft ground they are mounted on broad wheels or on track-laying tractor surfaces. One peculiar form of walking traction used by a drag-line excavator was described in Chapter XIII.\n\nDITCHING AND TRENCHING MACHINES\nFor digging narrow ditches and trenches, particularly for sewers, water mains, gas-pipe lines, etc., a number of very interesting machines have been invented which are of two general types, the endless chain and the wheel excavators. The first type consists of a traction engine with a ladder at the rear that drops down into the trench. About this ladder runs an endless chain which carries a series of scoops or buckets. These are dragged up against the breast of the work and carry the excavated earth to the top of the ladder where it is dumped upon a transverse belt conveyor and carried to one side of the trench. With the larger sizes of chain excavators, trenches may be dug to a depth of twenty feet and the width of the trench may be from two to six feet wide.\n\nThe wheel type of trenching machine is similar in principle to the chain excavator. Instead of the chain of buckets, it has a wheel fitted with buckets. In one prominent type the wheel has no hub or spokes, but consists of a rim that is supported on and is turned by four friction rollers mounted in a rigid frame. This frame is mounted on a boom which can be raised or lowered as desired. Such machines can commonly dig to a depth of a dozen feet or so.\n\nA ditch differs from a trench in the fact that its side walls are sloping instead of vertical. A trench is usually a temporary excavation for the laying of[255] pipes or conduits while the ditch is left open and serves for irrigation or drainage. There are chain ditching machines in which the chain of buckets runs laterally across the course of the ditch, dipping into the earth to form a V-shaped channel. In connection with the draining of the Everglades of Florida, a peculiar wheel type of ditcher was built. The wheel is of gigantic proportions, consisting of a series of radiating shovels or scoops shaped to conform to the outline of the ditch. As the wheel revolves it scoops up the mud which slides down toward the hub of the wheel and is carried to one side by a traveling conveyor.\n\nFLOATING EXCAVATORS\nThe main difficulty in drainage work is to provide a good footing for the machine which must necessarily be very heavy. Broad caterpillar tread surfaces are about the only means of locomotion. In very soft swampy regions dredges have to be used. Dredges are merely floating excavators. In them the problem of support and locomotion disappear and there are no limitations of size and weight to be considered. Floating excavators are therefore much more powerful than excavators that run on land. The ordinary dipper dredge is merely a floating steam shovel with a much longer dipper handle and much larger dipper. When work on the slides of the Panama Canal had proceeded far enough to admit of using dredges in place of steam shovels material progress was made. Two enormous dipper dredges were built, each provided with a dipper that had a capacity of fifteen cubic yards or about twenty tons at a single lift. The dipper was big enough to hold thirty men. The[256] dipper handle was seventy-two feet long and it could reach down to a depth of fifty feet. A smaller dipper of ten cubic yards capacity was also provided. The power of these huge dredges was illustrated when one of them, while using its ten-yard bucket, picked up an enormous bowlder weighing forty tons. It was much bigger than the dipper that had raised it and it was far too big to be placed on the mud scow that was receiving the spoil brought up by the dredge. Had it been rolled off on the scow it would have crashed right through the bottom of the boat and so the big rock had to be drilled and broken up on the dipper before it could be dumped into the scow.\n\nFor work on a soft bottom, grab buckets are used in place of dippers. These may be made of two scoops as in the clam-shell bucket or of four leaves as in the orange-peel bucket. No rigid handle is provided for these scoops. They are spread open as they are lowered into the water and on hauling in the hoisting cable, the scoops or leaves come together biting into the bottom and lifting up a load of mud. Grab buckets are largely used for picking up coal, ore, gravel, etc.\n\nThe equivalent of the chain trench-digging machine is found in the ladder dredge. A ladder is hung over the stern of the dredge and carries a chain of buckets which dig into the bottom and bring up the mud or sand.\n\nGOLD MINING WITH A DREDGE\nIt is a dredge of this type that is put to the peculiar task of gold mining. The dredge eats its way into gold-bearing sands, the material passing through a system of separators which extract the gold and then being discharged at the rear of the dredge. The dredge floats in a pool of water that it carries with it, for as it excavates ahead it builds up sand banks behind. In this way it may travel far from the river from which it first started.\n\n\nDIGGING A TRENCH WITH A CHAIN TYPE MACHINE\n\n\nMULTIPLE PLOWING ON A WESTERN WHEAT FIELD\u2014TURNING FIFTY FURROWS AT ONCE\n\n[257]\n\nSUCTION DREDGES\nSuction dredges are particularly adapted for excavating sandy bottoms. One type used for dredging channels consists of a large steam vessel with large bins into which the dredged material is pumped. At each side of the boat there is a long pipe which may be let down into the water. Each pipe terminates in a drag or footpiece with grated opening which is designed to be dragged along the bottom as the vessel slowly steams ahead. Powerful pumps suck a stream of water up the pipes which carries with it a quantity of sand. The sand and water flow into the bins, the solid matter settling to the bottom while the liquid flows out over the top. When the settlings have filled the tanks, the drags are pulled up and the vessel steams out to sea. Here doors in the bottom of the bins are opened and the material drops through. The idea of opening up the bottom of a boat to empty it seems rather startling until we consider that the bins are sealed off from the rest of the boat and do not contribute to its buoyancy. The sand that is dumped out of them is much heavier than the water that takes its place when the bin doors are opened.\n\nCANAL DIGGING UNDER WATER\nThe Ambrose channel in lower New York Bay was dredged by means of suction dredges. The channel is forty feet deep at low water and the bottom had to be excavated from ten to twenty-five[258] feet to attain this depth. About seventy million cubic yards of material had to be excavated or nearly a third as much as was excavated in the Panama Canal. The Ambrose channel is seven miles long while the Panama Canal is forty-five miles in length. Two of the larger dredges each had a capacity of forty-five hundred cubic yards in their bins or enough to load a train about a mile long, composed of 175 cars. It took less than three hours to fill the bins. The openings in the gratings of the drags measured about eight by nine inches and any stones or solid matter small enough to pass through them was easily sucked up into the bins. When a pile of stones of larger diameter was encountered a deep hole was dredged around it and then by means of a water jet the stones were forced into the hole.\n\nThe material sucked up by a dredge is sometimes dumped into a scow alongside. This makes the structure of the dredge less expensive, but where work has to be conducted in bodies of water exposed to storms it is more expedient to let the dredge collect the material within its own hull.\n\nLAND BUILDING WITH DREDGES\nThe sand drawn up by a suction dredge is valuable material for land building. In fact, a suction dredge is often used for the double purpose of excavating and filling in low land. Sometimes its only purpose is to fill in tide flats to above tide level. The material is discharged through a pipe line which may be over a mile in length. This pipe line is supported on a string of wooden or steel pontoons. The pipe sections are connected by means of heavy rubber sleeves so as to make the line flexible. This permits the dredge to move about and also allows[259] of moving the discharge end about to distribute the sand properly.\n\nUnfortunately all dredging does not consist of sand and mud. Sometimes snags and matted roots are encountered which give trouble. For handling such material rotary cutters are used. The bow of the dredge is fitted with a hinged ladder about sixty to seventy feet long in which the cutter is mounted. The ladder also carries the suction pipe close to the cutter. The ladder is lowered to the bottom and the revolving cutter chops up the roots into pieces which are drawn up into the suction pipe. The size of the pieces that are sometimes sucked up is remarkable. The greater part of the area of the New Orleans Inner Harbor Navigation Canal was filled with stumps and matted cypress roots. The cutters tore up and cut these roots and stumps and the pieces were transported through a pipe line about 600 feet long. Stumps that were too large to be handled in this way were undercut and sunk below grade.\n\nCutters are used also for loosening packed hard bottoms and some of them will dig into hard pan and even soft rock. A pressure of 100 to 150 pounds per square inch is maintained in a discharge pipe twenty to twenty-four inches in diameter, which is enough to carry along heavy bowlders dug up by the cutter.\n\nTHE DEEPEST MINE SHAFT\nSo far we have dealt only with surface conditions, but man has not been content to stay on the surface of this planet. True, we have scarcely begun to explore the crust of the earth. The deepest mine in the world is the Morro Velho in the province of Minas Geraes, Brazil. Here the earth has been[260] penetrated to a depth of 6,426 feet in quest of gold. This is a depth of less than a mile and a quarter and it shrinks into insignificance when we reflect that we must go more than 3,000 times that distance to reach the center of the earth. However, we have made material progress in shaft-sinking in recent years, and it is quite likely that the lure of scientific research may prove even more powerful than that of gold and that some day we shall be induced to dig many miles into the crust of the earth just to learn something more about this globe that whirls us through space.\n\nWe have not yet reached the point at which hand labor may be dispensed with in tunnel work, but there are machines which will do what formerly could only be accomplished with the manually wielded pick and shovel. We have already (in Chapter VII) described the pneumatic tunnel shield and explained how it is sometimes driven forward through soft silt by means of hydraulic jacks without any excavation of material. This method of tunneling which is analogous to driving a punch through soft metal, has a very limited field of application. It is impossible to force the shield in this manner through sand or through any but very soft silt.\n\nTUNNELING BY MACHINE\nThe city of Cleveland takes its drinking water from Lake Erie. In order to obtain water that is not contaminated by the refuse of the city, tunnels are carried out under the bottom of the lake about two miles from the shore where they terminate in water intakes far enough below the surface to avoid floating impurities and far enough above the[261] bottom to avoid impurities that have settled to the lake bed. The material through which the tunnels pass is a stiff clay, that cuts like cheese. So uniform is this material that a special machine was built to bore the tunnel through it. This machine is somewhat similar to a boring mill. It has an arm that revolves against the face of the tunnel heading and carries a cutter that travels along the arm so that it cuts a continuous spiral ribbon of clay. The clay ribbon passes back through the machine and is loaded into a train of dump cars.\n\nFor boring tunnels in hard rock many different machines have been invented, but not one of them as yet has proved an unqualified success. One very interesting machine, which was tried on the New York subway excavation at 42d Street and Lexington Avenue, consisted of a series of chipping hammers which, by means of pneumatic mechanism, were made to hammer and pulverize the face of the rock with repeated blows. The hammers were arranged in a circle and were revolved as they hammered so that the whole surface of the heading was attacked and a circular tunnel was cut through the rock. A serious disadvantage under which the machine labored was the fact that the rock had to be crushed to a powder or into small chips before it could be removed.\n\nIn ordinary rock excavation holes are bored into the heading and the rock is then blown out by means of dynamite or some other explosive. Large fragments of rock are then broken up into pieces small enough to be handled readily, but no energy is wasted in reducing the material to a powder. The percussion drills with which the rock is bored have already been briefly described. When boring holes[262] for a blast in soft material, such as bituminous coal, a drill is used which resembles in many respects an ordinary twisted auger bit except that it is many feet in length. It is driven by hand into the coal by the use of a common bit brace. Percussion drills or punches are also used. These are driven either by pneumatic or electric power.\n\nCOAL-CUTTING MACHINERY\nWhen excavating coal the heading is first undercut, that is, a deep slot is cut in the wall of coal along the floor line. Then blast holes are bored into the coal above this cut so that when the charges are fired the coal will be broken downward. To undercut the coal special machines are used, driven by compressed air or electricity. These have endless chains fitted with chisel or pick points that bite into and cut the coal. After the material has been shattered and reduced to fragments of convenient size special machinery may be employed to shovel it away from the heading and into dump cars. One electrically driven shoveling machine which was tried out on some of the Catskill aqueduct excavation had a broad open shovel which could be driven into the pile of rock fragments under the control of an operator and would scoop up the material, delivering it upon a traveling belt conveyor which carried it on to the train cars. Many types of mechanical shoveling and loading machines have been built for use in mines. They are driven either by pneumatic or electric power.\n\nEXPLORING SUBSURFACE CONDITIONS\nIn all engineering work it is highly important to explore subsurface conditions before starting[263] any construction or even drawing up plans. The ordinary pneumatic percussion drill will not serve for deep holes. Instead a rotary boring motion is requisite. The tool is mounted with black diamond cutters which cut through the hardest rock. Water is introduced into the hole to lubricate the tool and also to wash out the abraded material. By trapping this material the character of the rock penetrated may be determined. The material, however, is pulverized and does not furnish, as a general rule, a fair sample of the rock. When it is highly important to determine the exact nature of the rock or other material a core drill is used. In other words the drill is a hollow tube set with cutting crystals about its periphery. As the tool is revolved it cuts an annular slot in the rock leaving a central core standing. This core is broken off and drawn to the surface and furnishes a true sample of the material encountered by the drill.\n\nThere is an interesting type of core drill in which steel shot is used in place of diamonds. The cutting end of the drill is a collar with a notched edge. Steel balls are fed into the drill and under the cutting head. The balls are caught in the notches and rolled around against the rock surface. There is also a partial dragging action. The friction is sufficient to wear away the rock. As the balls wear away they are replaced with new ones. Very evidently such drilling costs less for upkeep than diamond drilling, but it is not as rapid as the latter.\n\nLOCATING ROCK UNDER HUDSON RIVER\nA notable illustration of exploration drilling was furnished by the surveys for the Hudson crossing of the Catskill Aqueduct. To bring water from the[264] Catskill Mountains to New York City it was necessary to cross the Hudson River. In order to furnish a permanent conduit it was decided to carry the water in an inverted siphon bored through solid rock. It was necessary to obtain a profile of the rock at the point where a crossing seemed most feasible. Borings were therefore made from a barge anchored in the river, but it was impossible with such an unsteady working base to carry on the boring to any considerable depth. Tides, the wash of passing steamers, floating ice, all combined to obstruct the work. Drills were constantly broken. Finally it was decided to do the boring from opposite banks of the river at such an angle that bore holes would meet or pass each other under the middle of the river. The exploration boring from the barges indicated that solid rock lay at a considerable depth below the river bed and that the bore holes would have to be set at a sharp angle to keep from breaking through rock. The river at that point is about 3,000 feet wide and a boring from the surface at the middle of the river had been driven to a depth of 768 feet without striking solid rock. Two shafts were sunk to a depth of about 250 feet and from these diamond drill borings were started at such an angle that they would cross at a depth of 1,500 feet. Excellent rock was encountered throughout the boring. Then a second set of borings was made which crossed at a depth of 950 feet without encountering any appreciable amount of water. It was accordingly decided to carry the aqueduct in vertical shafts, one at each side of the river, at a depth of 1,100 feet below water level, and then connect these shafts with a horizontal tunnel. It was important to have a good solid rock[265] cover over the tunnel because the aqueduct reaches the river with a head of 400 feet which added to the 1,100 feet of depth of the inverted siphon gave a total head of 1,500 feet or a hydraulic pressure of about forty-two tons per square inch.\n\nAlthough the diamond drill borings just mentioned were remarkable because of their inclination and because of the cramped quarters from which they were driven, they do not begin to compare in depth with some of the borings made in search of water and of oil. The deepest boring in the world to date is near Fairmount, West Virginia, where a hole six inches in diameter was driven to a depth of 7,579 feet or nearly a mile and a half. At that point an earth slide stopped further borings.\n\nBORING FOR OIL\nThe time-honored method of boring for oil known as the percussive system is to hammer through the earth and rock with a heavy steel drill. The drill really consists of a long string of parts measuring altogether as much as sixty feet in length. (See Figure 64.) The drill proper or bit has a cutting edge adapted for the character of the material it is to penetrate. The bit is attached to a steel bar known as the \u201cauger stem\u201d which may be from twelve to forty-five feet in length. Then come the \u201cjars\u201d or a link member which allows a play of about sixteen inches. The purpose of this is to assist in freeing the bit from the material it is penetrating by jarring it upward on the upstroke of the drill. Above the jars there is another bar known as the sinker, and this is provided with a rope socket to which is attached the cable that carries the string of drill parts. The cable passes over a pulley to a[266] walking beam which gives the necessary up-and-down motion.\n\n\nFIG. 64.\u2014A STRING OF WELL-DRILLING TOOLS\n\nThe loose material in the bore is removed by a sand pump. To protect the bore from caving a casing of steel pipe must be lowered into the well. The boring may proceed at the rate of ten to sixty feet per day, depending upon the material penetrated and the depth of the well. All sorts of difficulties are liable to interrupt the work. The cable may break, the string of tools may become unscrewed, or the casing may drop into the hole, and[267] then follows the tedious process of fishing for the lost parts and hauling them up out of the well.\n\nAs the drilling proceeds, the bore becomes progressively smaller and casings of smaller diameter must be used. The well is completed by lowering a pipe within the casing through which the oil flows to the surface and is carried to the storage tanks and thence by pipe lines to the refineries.\n\nWhile the percussive system of drilling is very generally used throughout the American oil fields, rotary methods of drilling are largely employed in California.\n\n[268]\n\nCHAPTER XVII\nFROM FIBER TO FABRIC\n\nIT IS NOT very long since the spinning wheel and the clacking loom were an indispensable furnishing of every farmhouse and of many city dwellings as well. With infinite patience the fleece of sheep, the lint of flax, the filaments of silk and the fibers of cotton were spun into yarn and then woven into cloth, and it was the nimble fingers of the housewife that carried the process through from the matted raw product to the finished garment.\n\nIt is comparatively easy to comprehend the development of machines for dealing with such gross material as earth, rock, iron, and wood, but when we come to consider the infinitely delicate and almost imponderable fibers that go to make up our textiles, the marvel is that any but highly skilled human hands, guided by keen eyesight, could combine the tangled and obstreperous filaments into fine yarn and weave this yarn into complicated patterns of cloth. But the spinning wheel and hand loom could not stand long in the path of power-driven machinery, and now huge, blind machines, with stiff, unbending fingers of metal, comb out the matted masses of raw material, remove the dirt and twigs, straighten out the snarls far quicker and better than could be done by hand, and transform the fibers into beautiful fabrics such as in former days would have been the envy of kings.\n\n[269]\n\nWe cannot attempt to describe all the machinery involved in the spinning and weaving of yarn, but it is highly important that every well-informed person have a general knowledge of textile machinery. Because cotton cloth is more widely used than either linen or wool, we shall confine ourselves to the cotton branch of the textile industry, particularly as the difference between the treatment of cotton and other textile materials lies chiefly in the preparation of the thread or yarn.\n\nThe predominance of cotton among textiles may be traced back to the invention of a young New Englander fresh from college, who went to Georgia as a private tutor, only to find when he got there that some one else had been engaged in his stead, leaving him stranded and practically penniless in a strange land. We had occasion to refer to this man in Chapter III. Eli Whitney was a born mechanic, and before entering college had not only shown great skill but had actually built up a thriving business in the manufacture of nails, hatpins and knife blades.\n\nINVENTION OF THE COTTON GIN\nThe agricultural condition of Georgia and its neighboring States at the time that Whitney arrived there was very poor. There was no market for their products. A splendid cotton, with fibers from 1\u215c to 2\u00bd inches long, was growing on the islands along the coast, but this cotton could not be raised inland. The upland product, known as \u201cgreen seed\u201d cotton, had a fiber only half as long as the \u201cSea Island\u201d cotton, but the principal drawback to its use was the difficulty of separating the fiber from the seed. It was a day\u2019s work[270] for one woman to separate a single pound of the \u201cgreen seed\u201d cotton fiber.\n\nHis attention having been brought to this matter, Whitney undertook to design a machine which would remove the fiber from the seed in a small fraction of the time required by hand labor. He was visiting at the time at the plantation of Mrs. Greene, widow of General Nathaniel Greene, of Revolutionary fame, and he set himself to the task with such limited materials and tools as he could find on the estate. In a couple of weeks he had built a model which contained all the essentials of the modern cotton gin, with which a single man could separate more cotton in a day than could be produced by hand in a whole season. This was in the winter of 1792. The effect of the invention was felt immediately. Cotton production had been falling off steadily. In 1791, 189,316 pounds of cotton had been exported. The next year there was a falling off to 138,328 pounds, but following the introduction of the cotton gin exports rose to 487,000 pounds in 1793, 1,681,000 in 1794, and 6,276,000 in 1795. Fifty years later the world production amounted to 1,169,600,000, nearly seven-eighths of which was contributed by the United States, and of this only a small amount was Sea Island cotton.\n\nA cotton gin (Fig. 65) consists of a gang of circular saws (A), with forwardly pointed teeth which pass between the ribs of an inclined grating (B) that forms the floor of a chamber (C) known as a roll box. In this box is mounted a toothed roller (D). The cotton is fed into the box and the fibers are seized by the teeth of the saws and dragged through the grating while the seeds, being too[271] large to pass through, are left behind and, rolling down the grating, drop into a hopper. The action of the saws is such as to impart a rolling motion to the mass of cotton, and hence to the roller in the roll box. This tends to drag the cotton into the roll box and bring fresh supplies to the saws. The fleece carried by the saw teeth is beaten off by a wheel (E) fitted with wire brushes. These brushes, traveling in the same direction as the saw teeth, but at a higher velocity, readily disengage the fibers from the teeth and create an air blast that blows the cotton fleece out of the gin.\n\n\nFIG. 65\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A COTTON GIN\n\nPREPARING COTTON FOR THE SPINNING MULE\nCotton as it comes from the bale is a compact, matted mass, mixed with bits of seed, leaves, sand, and other impurities, and it must pass through a[272] number of machines before it comes out as a pure, light, fleecy product, with the fibers combed parallel. Even for a medium yarn a dozen machines are required to prepare the cotton for the spinning mule.\n\nA system of \u201ccounts\u201d is used to indicate the size of yarn and it is based on the number of hanks it takes to make a pound. A hank is always 840 yards and 50\u2019s would mean that the yarn is of such fineness that it would take 50 \u00d7 840 yards (=4,200 yards) of it to weigh a pound. Yarn below 30\u2019s is graded as coarse; between 30\u2019s and 60\u2019s as medium and above 60\u2019s as fine. To prepare cotton as it comes from the bale for a fine yarn of, say, 100\u2019s, it must go through no less than sixteen machines before it reaches the mule.\n\nWe have not the space to describe all of these machines, but in general it will suffice to say that the cotton is graded by passing it through a series of pickers. These machines throw out the fibers and beat them so as to knock out the impurities and, at the same time, a blast of air blows out the dust. The cotton is treated by a number of such machines in succession and is finally delivered in a broad sheet known as a \u201clap,\u201d after which it passes through the carding machine which combs out the tangled bunches and removes further impurities from the lap. The lap is then gathered into a compact rope known as a \u201csliver.\u201d The sliver goes through the drawing rolls which serve to parallelize the fibers and make the sliver of even thickness, and at the same time to give a moderate amount of twist so that it will hold together, and it issues from the machine as \u201croving.\u201d In the case of fine yarn the sliver issuing from the carding[273] machine goes through a combing machine so as to remove the finer fibers. The bobbins of the roving are then placed in the spinning machine, which may be either the spinning mule or the ring spinning machine. The principal difference between the two is that the spinning mule is intermittent in its operation, while the ring spinner not only spins the roving into yarn but at the same time winds it up on a bobbin.\n\n\nFIG. 66.\u2014ARKWRIGHT\u2019S DRAWING ROLLS\n\nARKWRIGHT\u2019S DRAWING ROLLS\nThe first advance over the old-fashioned spinning wheel, which dates back to the fifteenth century, was in 1770, when the first spinning jenny was invented by Hargreaves. This consisted practically of a multiple spinning wheel by which one man could spin a large numbers of bobbins of yarn at the same time. It was at about the same time that[274] Arkwright invented the drawing rolls which have played a most important part in the preparation of yarn, and this invention is worthy of our attention because it contains an interesting mechanical principle. As shown in Figure 66, a number of pairs of rolls are provided through which the roving passes, but successive pairs operate at higher velocities. Thus, the second pair of rollers through which the roving passes run at a little higher speed than the first pair, the third a little higher than the second pair, and so on. As a result, the roving is drawn out by the operation and issues from the last pair of rollers at a higher speed than it entered the first pair of rollers. The only way in which it can accommodate itself to this accelerated motion is to be attenuated or drawn out. Weights are used, as shown in the drawing, to press the upper rollers against the lower ones.\n\nTHE SPINNING MULE\nShortly after Arkwright\u2019s invention came the mule spinner, invented by Crompton between 1774 and 1779. Machines operated on the same general principle as this are in general use to-day. In the old-fashioned method of spinning by hand the worker took a small quantity of cotton, pulled it out into a long sliver, attached one end to a bobbin and gave the bobbin a twirl between his hands in order to spin the fiber into yarn; then the yarn was wound up on the bobbin and the process was repeated. The spinning mule does practically the same thing, but infinitely faster and on a much larger scale. As shown in Figure 67, the bobbins of roving (A) are mounted on a stand and passed through a set of drawing rolls (B) which are regulated to pull the rovings out to the desired thickness of yarn. The roving then passes to the nose of a \u201ccop,\u201d or spindle (C), which is revolved at very high speed. The cop is carried by a carriage (D) which moves away from the bobbins of roving to the position indicated by dotted lines, while the cop is revolving. The cop has a travel of about five feet during the time the yarn is drawn out and spun. Then the carriage moves back toward the stand upon which the bobbins of roving are mounted and the spun yarn is wound up on the cop. The reason the yarn does not wind up on the cop while it is spinning is because it runs to the nose of the cop and, at each turn of the cop, the coil twists on the nose and slips off. On the return of the carriage, however, a set of wires (E), called \u201cfallers,\u201d press the yarn down so that the revolving cop will wind up the slack.\n\n[275]\n\n\nFIG. 67.\u2014DETAILS OF A SPINNING MULE\n\n[276]\n\nThe continuously operating ring-spinning machine is provided with a ring frame (Figure 68) around the cop or spindle. This frame, together with the spindle, revolves at high speed, but as the ring revolves a little more slowly than the spindle it winds the yarn comparatively slowly upon the spindle or bobbin.\n\nWOVEN, BRAIDED, KNITTED, AND NET GOODS\nHaving now produced our yarn, we may pause to consider the different types of fabric into which it may be formed, and to draw a distinction between, woven, braided, knitted, and net goods. In weaving we have two sets of threads, one set running transversely to the other; in braided materials the threads all run longitudinally and are arranged to cross each other diagonally, so that they are interwoven;[277] in knitting and netting there is a single thread. In the case of netting this thread is knotted where it loops back upon itself, whereas in knitting it is merely looped without knotting.\n\nTHE LOOM\nThe loom can trace its genealogy away back to early Babylonian times, and the modern power-driven machine does not differ in its broad principles of operation from its ancient progenitor\u2014the hand loom.\n\n\nFIG. 68.\u2014RING-SPINNING FRAME\n\n[278]\n\n\nFIG. 69.\u2014THE HEDDLES OF A LOOM\n\nEvery industry has a vocabulary of its own to furnish names for its machine parts and products peculiar unto itself, and in this respect the textile industry is by no means an exception. The threads that run lengthwise in a piece of woven cloth are known as the \u201cweft,\u201d \u201cwoof\u201d or \u201cfilling.\u201d In the loom the warp threads are threaded through loops on what are known as \u201cheddles\u201d; in fact, there are two \u201cheddles,\u201d A and B, Figure 69. Alternate warp threads (C) pass through the loops of one heddle, and the other threads through the loops[279] on the other heddle. When one heddle is raised and the other lowered, the threads form a wedge-shaped space (D) which is known as a \u201cshed.\u201d The filling thread is sent through the shed and is then pressed closely into the wedge-shaped space against the cloth already woven by means of a \u201creed\u201d (E) which is a comblike member with teeth or flat pieces of metal that pass between the warp threads. This done, the position of the heddles is reversed, so that A is now lowered and B raised, thus binding the warp thread in place and forming another shed for the next warp thread; and thus the process continues.\n\nThe filling thread is placed in a shuttle (F) which carries a bobbin on which the thread is wound. As the shuttle is thrown back and forth through the shed, the thread is unwound and trails behind it. Formerly the shuttle was thrown back and forth by hand, but years ago, long before the invention of the steam engine, the flying shuttle was invented. In other words, a mechanism was provided for striking the shuttle a blow and throwing it across the warp from side to side. By this means the speed of operations was greatly increased.\n\nAbout the middle of the eighteenth century the drop box was invented. This consists of a receptacle for shuttles carrying different colors of thread which may be selected in a definite order and thrown back and forth so as to vary the pattern of the cloth.\n\nIn present looms a special machine is provided for taking the threads from the bobbins or cops and laying them in an even sheet to form the warp of the loom. These are wound on a beam and the[280] machine is known as a beam warper. As the threads are apt to be somewhat fuzzy it is necessary to size them, and a machine known as a slasher is employed for this purpose. This machine coats each thread of warp yarn with a sizing compound or an adhesive and dries the sheet of warp preparatory to its use in the loom.\n\nIn common weaving the weft or filling threads run alternately under and over the warp threads with perfect regularity. A pattern can be formed by passing the weft threads under and over alternate groups of warp threads, and this is effected in the ordinary loom by threading the weft in groups through the heddles, i. e., instead of having every second thread pass through one heddle and the intervening threads through the other heddle; the threads are arranged in alternate groups of two or more. This gives a regular pattern, but it may be varied to form ornamental designs if the groups are varied. Such designs used to be worked out by hand very slowly and laboriously, with the result that figured weaving was very expensive.\n\nTHE JACQUARD LOOM\nAt the French Exposition of 1801 a loom was exhibited that made a sensation. With seemingly human intelligence it selected individual warp threads or groups of threads and raised them or lowered them so as to work out elaborate ornamental designs. The inventor, Joseph Marie Jacquard, of Lyons, received a medal for his marvelous invention and was decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor.\n\nThe \u201cbrains\u201d of the Jacquard loom is a set of pasteboard cards that are perforated in accordance[281] with a prearranged design. The warp threads, instead of being passed through the loops of two heddles, are passed through what might be termed individual heddles, one for each thread, or for a small group of threads. These consist of cords in each of which is an eyelet through which the warp thread passes. The cord is weighted at its lower end and its upper end is fastened to a hook in a box at the top of the machine. The hooks engage transverse bars known as \u201cgriffes\u201d or \u201cknives,\u201d and when the griffes are raised, the hooks engaging them are also raised. In this way the warp threads that pass through the eyelets that are connected to the hooks are raised. But running horizontally across the hooks there are \u201cneedles\u201d or rods with eyelets or bends in them through which the hooks pass. These needles may be moved lengthwise to make the hoops engage or disengage the knives. The mechanism is illustrated in Figure 70, where the knives are shown in section at A, the hooks at B and the needles at C. For the sake of simplicity only eight hooks and needles are shown; in actual practice there are hundreds in a single machine. At the right-hand end of each needle there is a spring which pushes the needle toward the left, thereby bringing the hook through which it passes into position to be lifted by its griffe. At the left-hand side of the machine there is a card (D) which presses back the needles and thereby bends the hooks out of position to engage the griffes. However, there are perforations in the card through which certain of the needles can pass, letting the hooks they control engage the needles. The cards thus select the particular weft threads that are to be raised. In our illustration most of the needles[282] have entered holes in the card, but the second, fourth and sixth from the top have been pushed back by the blank wall of the card and their hooks have been bent back clear of the griffes. Only four cards are shown in the drawing arranged in a four-sided box or \u201ccylinder,\u201d and the cards are successively presented to the needles. For more elaborate designs a large number of cards are used, arranged in a slatted belt, and these come successively into position. As many as thirty thousand cards have been employed to carry out a single pattern.\n\n\nFIG. 70.\u2014DETAIL OF A JACQUARD LOOM\n\nINVENTION OF THE KNITTING MACHINE\nWe are wont to call Necessity the Mother of Invention; in many cases Laziness has given rise to valuable inventions, but according to legend, Cupid[283] played the leading r\u00f4le in the development of the knitting machine. It is said that in 1589 William Lee of England fell in love, but the girl who was the object of his devotion was always so busy with her knitting that she could not give him the attention he sought or thought he deserved. However, Lee was not to be thwarted in this fashion, so he built a machine to do the knitting in order that the girl could devote herself more completely to him.\n\nThere is another less pleasant version of the story to the effect that Lee became so attached to his knitting machine that he neglected the girl. However, in either case, love was somehow mixed up in the invention of the knitting machine.\n\nWe are not going to attempt to delve into the complicated mechanism of a modern knitting machine, but will merely call attention to the fact that modern machines perform automatically practically all the movements of the human hand in hand knitting.\n\nThe tendency of modern machinery has been to relieve the housewife of the tedious work she formerly performed and to take such work away from the home to the factory. There is one important machine, however, which has been introduced into the home, apparently to stay; for in the majority of houses it is still considered indispensable. It is a fact that the introduction of labor-saving machinery into the household has, until recently, met with stern opposition on the part of the housewife. It is all the more remarkable, therefore, that in the middle of the nineteenth century the sewing machine began successfully to invade the home.\n\n[284]\n\nHOWE\u2019S INVENTION OF THE SEWING MACHINE\nIt was in 1844 that Elias Howe hit upon the brilliant idea of putting an eye at the point of a needle. This enabled him to produce a successful sewing machine, because it was unnecessary for him to pass the needle completely through the cloth in order to pull the thread through it. When the needle point penetrated the cloth a shuttle passed through the loop of thread that was carried through with the point. This shuttle carried a second thread which interlocked with the thread of the needle forming what is known as a \u201clock stitch.\u201d In Howe\u2019s machine the cloth was held vertically and the needle which was curved was carried by a lever. The needle was driven through the cloth with a swinging motion, somewhat like that of a pick-ax. The shuttle was driven back and forth by a pair of strikers after the manner of the flying shuttle of a loom. George Fisher, a friend of Howe, furnished $500 with which the first successful machine was built in 1845, and with this machine Howe sewed two suits of clothes, one for Mr. Fisher and the other for himself. A public exhibition was held at which the machine, crude as it was, beat five of the best hand-sewers that could be found. In 1863 Howe was reaping a fortune in royalties from his machine which were estimated at $4,000 per day.\n\nThe next notable improvement in sewing machinery was that of the rotary bobbin, invented by A. B. Wilson, which was patented in 1852. This did away with the flying shuttle and simplified the machine considerably. It made the sewing machine comparatively quiet, thus adapting it for domestic[285] use. In Wilson\u2019s machine, a rotating hook passed through the loop of thread and carried it around the bobbin on which the lower thread was wound. Wilson also invented the four-motion feed for feeding the cloth under the needle. Sewing machines up to that time had been operated by hand, but Isaac Merritt Singer introduced a foot-power machine and by progressive business methods built up a thriving industry and did much to establish the sewing machine, not only at home, but abroad as well.\n\nTHE SINGLE-THREAD SEWING MACHINE\nThe single-thread machine was invented by a Virginia farmer who had never seen a sewing machine. James E. A. Gibbs had seen a picture of a sewing machine and, unaware of the fact that there was a shuttle carrying a second thread on the rear, or under side of the cloth, fell to puzzling over the problem of what happened to the thread carried by the needle through the cloth. Somehow, it seemed to him, the loop of thread must be held until the next stitch carried another loop of thread through it, thus forming a chain stitch. This led him to invent an ingenious revolving hook. With infinite patience he whittled out a model of his invention, and it is this hook that is the outstanding feature of the Wilcox and Gibbs machine.\n\nMACHINE-MADE EMBROIDERIES\nA notable modern development of the sewing machine is its adaptation to the making of embroideries and even laces. In the common domestic sewing machine the cloth is fed step by step under the needle, and the length of the step regulates the[286] size or length of the stitches. The feed may be set for short or long stitches. It is evident that if a greater range of length of stitch were provided, and if, while the machine was operating, the stitch could be varied at will, not only in length but in the direction as well, it would be possible to work out elaborate patterns of embroidery. This is what is done on the power-driven embroidery machines. Like the original Howe machine, the cloth is held vertically and a series of needles are used which pass horizontally through the cloth. As the needle retreats, the thread it carries forms a loop on the rear or \u201cwrong\u201d side of the cloth, and through this a shuttle is driven which carries a thread wound upon a bobbin. Between stitches the cloth is moved this way and that, in accordance with a prearranged pattern, and thus the design is embroidered. A single machine may have several hundred needles and, as they all work in unison, each needle repeats the design. The arrangement is such that one needle starts where the next one leaves off, so that the embroidery is continuous. The shuttles which operate on the wrong side of the cloth are small, boat-shaped parts which the Swiss have named \u201cschiffli\u201d or \u201clittle ships,\u201d and this name has come to be applied to the whole machine.\n\nThe guiding of the cloth to produce the required design is accomplished either by hand or automatically. In the hand-guided schiffli machine a skilled \u201cstitcher\u201d seated at one side of the machine operates a pantagraph, tracing an enlarged design mounted on a board before him. As he moves the lever vertically and horizontally the frame carrying the cloth is correspondingly moved before the needles. An expert stitcher can put a great deal[287] of individuality into the work, which is impossible in the strictly automatic machine; accordingly the pantagraph is used for the finer grades of embroideries. In the automatic machines a perforated roll like that of a piano player is used. The perforations control the movements of the frame that carries the fabric.\n\nFINE NEEDLEWORK BY MACHINE\nThese machines are of Swiss and German design, but American inventors have recently developed a machine for producing fine needlework which imitates very closely the work of the hand. In this machine the needle passes completely through the fabric as in ordinary hand sewing, but it does not have to be turned around for the return stitch because it is pointed at each end and has the eye in the middle. The needles are held by spring clips in a swinging frame. When the frame swings toward the cloth the needles are pushed through the fabric and their points are caught by spring clips in a frame on the opposite side. The latter frame draws the needles completely through and a set of hooks catch the thread and pull the stitch taut. The advantage of this type of machine is that it produces the same design on each side of the cloth; in other words, there is no \u201cwrong\u201d side to the embroidery. The design is controlled by a \u201cstitcher\u201d operating a pantagraphic system of levers and by skillful manipulation he can completely overcome the flat machinelike appearance of the automatic schiffli machine.\n\nLaces are very ingeniously produced on schiffli machines by using the \u201cburnt-out\u201d system invented forty years ago by a German, named Beckel. This[288] consists in the use of thread of a different material from that of the fabric, and after the embroidery is completed the fabric is removed either chemically or by the application of heat, leaving only the stitching, which forms a delicate lace. For instance, cotton thread may be embroidered on a groundwork of wool, or silk thread is used on a fabric of cotton. Laces made in this way are known as Plauen laces, taking their name from the city where Beckel invented the process, and they form a large part of the machine-made laces that are now so widely used.\n\n\nSAWING LOGS INTO 16-INCH LENGTHS PRIOR TO GRINDING THEM INTO PULP\n\n\nCopyright Kadel & Herbert\n\nTHE HEATER IN A PULP MILL WHERE THE WOOD PULP IS MIXED WITH CLAY\n\n\nA MODERN FOURDRINIER PAPER-MAKING MACHINE\n\n[289]\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\nTHE MAKING OF PAPER\n\nTHE MAKING of paper is closely related to that of textiles. In each case the same basic materials are used. A mass of interlacing fibers is formed into a continuous sheet, but the method of interlacing the fibers and holding them together is entirely different. Paper resembles felt more closely than any other form of fabric. The fibers are not woven but are matted together and compressed. In the case of felt the fibers of wool or hair are held together mainly by the microscopic barbs that they possess while paper fibers are held together by means of sizing.\n\nAlthough paper gets its name from papyrus the latter was not paper, for it was a felt of pith rather than fiber. The ancients produced a very fair writing material from the rushlike plants that grew in the swamps along the Nile. The stem of the papyrus was stripped of its bark and the pith was cut into thin ribbons which were laid side by side to form a sheet. Over these and at right angles to them was laid another layer of pith ribbons. The material was then soaked in water, pressed into a continuous sheet and dried. These sheets were then pasted together and rolled up into scrolls. Unquestionably they played a most important part in the civilization of ancient Egypt, providing, as they did, a[290] ready means of recording knowledge and disseminating it among the people.\n\nCHINESE INVENTION OF PAPER\nLike so many inventions that are of vital importance to modern civilization, paper is a Chinese invention. The Chinese made paper from the fibers of trees, a material to which we have reverted in recent years. The invention dates from about 150 A. D., when some one devised a process of reducing the bark of the mulberry tree to a pulp, beating it and boiling it in lye and then matting the fibers on a screen and pressing them into a finished sheet. The process was introduced into Europe by the crusaders in the 12th Century. In 1150 a paper-making plant was established in Italy and soon the new writing material was being made in increasing quantities and became a common article throughout Europe. It was not until the end of the 18th Century that machinery for making paper came into use.\n\nIn the old hand process which is still used to a very limited extent for special papers, the pulp, after being reduced to a thin milky fluid, was dipped out of a vat with a rectangular sieve which had a wire screen bottom of fine mesh. The water drained off, leaving the fibers upon the screen. As the pulp was draining the sieve was shaken about to distribute the fibers evenly and interlace them as much as possible. The depth of the sieve determined the amount of pulp that was dipped out and hence the thickness of the paper. The soft, matted mass of fibers was turned out upon a felt mat and left to dry. Soon other fibers came to be used and the finest grades of paper were made from linen and cotton rags. The rags were carefully sorted out and[291] washed after which they were stored in a damp place to rot for a number of weeks. Then they were cut and shredded and boiled until they were converted into a pulp. The complete process of making fine paper by hand took from two to three months. Paper was made in small sheets limited by the size of sieve that could readily be operated by hand.\n\nThe first man to make a continuous web of paper was Nicholas Louis Robert, a Frenchman who received a reward of 8,000 francs from his government for his invention. Robert\u2019s patent rights were acquired by the Fourdrinier Brothers (Henry and Sealy), of England. They developed and perfected the machine and to them is ascribed the honor of founding the modern paper industry.\n\nUSES OF PAPER\nPaper is more commonly and extensively used to-day than any other product of manufacture and is employed for an astonishing variety of purposes, ranging from milk bottles to suits of clothing. One very novel use we might mention, in passing, is to be found on the sugar plantations of Hawaii. After the cane is planted the fields are covered with a thick paper made, by the way, from sugar-cane fiber. This covering prevents the weeds from growing, but the sharp spikes of the sugar sprouts pierce the paper and grow through it. By the time the paper has disintegrated and the weeds have a chance to grow, the cane has such a start on them that they are kept shaded and cannot compete with or choke out the cane.\n\nTURNING FORESTS INTO PULP\nBefore we proceed to describe the modern Fourdrinier machine, we must look into present day[292] methods of preparing pulp. The finest papers are still made from linen and cotton rags. Esparto grass is largely used in Europe. This comes from Spain and North Africa. But by far the greater part of the paper produced to-day is made from the fiber of trees. Particularly is this true of our own country, which consumes half of the world\u2019s output of paper.\n\nIt used to be that only the poorest grades of paper were made from wood pulp; now however not only newspapers but nearly all books and magazines are printed on a forest product. Formerly only spruce wood was considered suitable for paper manufacture, but the rapid depletion of this raw material led to the employment of many other species of trees and our Government scientists are constantly searching for and experimenting with new woods for this purpose.\n\nBecause of the insatiable appetites of our large newspaper printing presses and because a newspaper is not intended to be an imperishable document but a fleeting record of passing events, quality is of little importance in the preparation of pulp for newsprint and everything must be sacrificed for speed. The pulp is made of \u201cground\u201d wood as distinguished from the chemically prepared wood pulp known as \u201csulphite.\u201d The wood is first stripped of its bark and then cut into pieces running from two to four feet in length, depending upon the size of the magazine of the grinder. The wood is pressed against a revolving grindstone by hydraulic pressure and at such an angle that the fibers torn off will be as long as possible. The fibers are borne off by a stream of water which carries them through a set of screens. These remove any unground slivers,[293] and eventually the pulp is drained of water and pressed into laps, or, if it is to be used immediately, it goes directly to the beating engine. Here it is mixed with a certain amount of \u201csulphite pulp,\u201d usually from 20 to 25 per cent. To correct the yellowish color of the pulp, a small amount of blue and red coloring is added. To give body to the paper from 5 to 15 per cent of clay is mixed into the pulp and, to bind the fibers together and give the paper a finish that will be at least partly nonabsorbent, a quantity of rosin and soda ash is added with enough alum to precipitate the rosin upon the fibers. The beater thoroughly mixes the mass of material and converts it into a fluid of the consistency of thin milk, which then passes on to the Fourdrinier machine.\n\nGETTING DOWN TO THE \u201cBONES\u201d OF THE WOOD\nPaper made from ground wood pulp soon discolors and becomes brittle owing to the presence of the lignin and resin of the tree. The superiority of sulphite pulp is due to the fact that chemical processes are used to remove these disturbing ingredients, leaving only the \u201cbones\u201d of the tree, that is, the pure cellulose fiber. Spruce wood is usually used and after being freed of its bark and thoroughly cleaned, all knots are cut out and it is sawed into short lengths which are then split and cut up into little chips from \u00bc to \u00bd inch long. These chips are boiled under pressure in a solution of sulphur dioxide and slaked lime. The \u201cdigesters\u201d in which the chips are boiled are large steel cylinders lined with brick set in cement and coated with litharge and glycerin, so as to prevent the sulphite liquor from coming into contact with the metal. A[294] steam pressure of seventy to eighty pounds is maintained for eight to ten hours and then the digesters are discharged into vats. The sulphite liquor in which the resinous matter is dissolved is drained away and the pulp is washed.\n\nSoft woods, such as poplar, basswood, etc., are boiled in caustic soda, producing what is known as \u201csoda pulp.\u201d \u201cSulphate pulp\u201d is made by boiling in a solution of sodium sulphate, to which a certain amount of sodium carbonate and caustic soda are added. This process is used for producing pulp for so-called \u201cKraft\u201d paper and brown wrapping paper.\n\nFormerly pulp was always made in the paper mill and hence the mills had to be located near the source of wood supply, but to-day the making of pulp is carried on as an independent industry in remote forest regions where water power is plentiful. The pulp is pressed into laps and compressed into bales weighing about 400 pounds. These are sent over long distances by rail or steamship to paper mills located in or near the big cities, so that the paper may be made near the points of consumption.\n\nBaled paper pulp has to be reconverted into a smooth milklike fluid. A shredding machine is used for this purpose, which tears the pulp apart and mixes it with water. Then it goes to the beater where it receives its quota of sulphite pulp, coloring matter, clay, and sizing, as explained before. After an hour of treatment in the beater, it passes on to a tank in which it is further diluted with water and is then put through a Jordan engine. This consists of a conical cylinder in which is placed a conical roll. Both cylinder and roll are formed with[295] knives that extend longitudinally, but the revolving knives are set at a slight angle to the fixed knives, somewhat after the fashion of a lawn mower. The conical form permits of careful adjustment of the roller in the cylinder. The pulp mixture enters at the smaller end and discharges at the larger end. This machine gives the pulp its final beating and reduces it to a very smooth consistency.\n\nTHE FOURDRINIER PAPER-MAKING MACHINE\nFrom the Jordan engine the pulp is passed on into the Fourdrinier machine, which we are now ready to investigate. The principal element of this machine is a traveling belt of copper wire gauze which takes the place of the screen or sieve used in the hand process. To confine the pulp to the belt there are two endless bands of rubber, known as \u201cdeckles,\u201d along each edge of the screen, which travel with the screen. To insure proper interlacing of the fibers, as in the hand process, the screen is shaken laterally at the rate of about 300 vibrations per minute.\n\nThe fluid pulp enters the machine through a flow box, where a constant hydraulic head is maintained, so as to preserve a uniform discharge to the wire gauze. The milky stream issues through a narrow opening in the flow box, known as a \u201cslicer.\u201d This may be adjusted to alter the width and also the thickness of the stream. No one would suspect from the appearance of the milky fluid that it is filled with fibers, but a microscopic examination of a drop of the thin liquid shows that it is filled with tiny particles floating in the water like logs in a river. It is interesting to watch this stream, as it passes out upon the screen, change magically before[296] one\u2019s eyes, from a milky stream into solid mass of pulp.\n\n[297]\n\n\nFIG. 71.\u2014DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF THE FOURDRINIER PAPER-MAKING MACHINE\n\nA.

Dandy Roll\nIn Figure 71, which is a diagrammatical view of a portion of a Fourdrinier machine, the flow box is shown at A and the copper gauze belt at B. This belt is supported on a series of rollers, C. The deckles which confine the pulp along the margins of the screen are shown at D. These belts travel with the wire gauze for a certain distance and then pass back over the pulleys, EE, while the wire cloth passes on and around the drums, FF. As soon as the pulp flows out upon the wire gauze, the water it contains begins to drain away through the gauze. But it does not do this fast enough under the mere pull of gravity and it must be helped by means of suction. At GG there are boxes or troughs that fit against the under side of the wire gauze. In them a partial vacuum is maintained by means of suction pumps and a large part of the water remaining in the pulp is sucked out here. A dandy roll is shown at H, which presses lightly upon the moist pulp, squeezing out the moisture in it, and at I there is a final suction box which further dries the web of fibers. It is the dandy roll that puts a patterned surface on the paper. If the face of the dandy roll is of finely woven wire cloth with diagonal mesh, a \u201cwove\u201d paper is produced, while if it is of such surface as to impress parallel lines in the half-formed paper, \u201claid\u201d paper is produced. Water marks are also produced by placing a suitable raised or depressed pattern on the dandy roll, producing a corresponding thickening or thinning of the pulp. Even after passing the last suction box, the thin web of paper is still very wet and so flimsy that it cannot be handled. Right here comes the most delicate part of the whole process. The web must be picked off the wire cloth and carried across a narrow gap to a felt belt which conducts it through another set of rollers, A felt-covered roll, J, known as a \u201ccouch\u201d roll, presses down upon the web and the latter clings to the felt in place of the wire cloth which passes down around the roller F. In starting a web of paper very skillful manipulation is required to transfer the web from the couch roll to the felt belt, but after it has once bridged the gap it has enough tensional strength to pull itself across the gap. The felt belt carries the web through a pair of heavy rollers which press out more of the water. Because[298] the paper passes through the rolls with the felt belt it receives an impression from the felt on the under side. This is now corrected by running the paper through a second pair of rolls in the reverse direction, and on a second felt belt, so that both sides of the paper receive the same impression. From here on the paper passes through a long series of steam-heated drying rolls and emerges eventually as a perfectly dry sheet.\n\nOur largest Fourdrinier machines make a web 200 inches wide and they can be run at a rate of 800 feet per minute, or more than nine miles per hour. The paper is made in lengths eight miles long, which are wound up into rolls to be fed into the huge printing presses of our metropolitan newspaper plants.\n\nThe difference between the making of news print and finer papers lies chiefly in the quality of pulp used and the quantity of clay and sizing added. After the finer grades have issued from the drying rolls, they are put through calenders to give them a glazed surface. This consists virtually in ironing the paper between smooth rolls of iron on one side and compressed paper or cotton on the other. Just as in ironing clothes, the paper must be moistened before being ironed and steam is used to supply the necessary moisture. In some cases a high glaze is given to one side only of the paper by means of friction. The paper passes between two rollers of different size. The smaller one travels faster than the larger one and consequently it slips on the paper, giving it a very smooth surface.\n\nTHE CYLINDER MACHINE FOR MAKING PAPER\nThere is another type of paper-making machine which is used for coarse papers, pasteboard, etc.[299] This is known as a cylinder machine. The wire gauze is formed into a cylinder which revolves in the liquid pulp. A slight suction is maintained in the cylinder which causes the water to flow in through the gauze; leaving the fiber drained on the surface. The cylinder revolves, carrying the drained pulp on its surface until it encounters a felt roll that picks off the web and carries it to the pressing and drying rolls. One disadvantage of this type of machine is that the cylinder in dragging the drained pulp through the water causes the fibers to be combed in a direction parallel to the run of the paper web, so that the paper, while strong in the direction of its length, is comparatively weak in the transverse direction. This is corrected to a certain degree by the use of \u201criffles\u201d or devices that produce eddies which disturb the even flow of the pulp.\n\nIn the making of pasteboard, a number of cylinders contribute their webs to form a single sheet of several plies.\n\n[300]\n\nCHAPTER XIX\nTYPESETTING AND PRINTING MACHINERY\n\n\u201cWHO WON the war?\u201d The question immediately brings forth numerous contenders who claim the honor, respectively, for the aviator, the chemist, the engineer, the mechanic, the farmer, the shipbuilder, etc. As a matter of fact, all these and many others as well were invaluable contributors to the final success, and \u201cthere is glory enough for all.\u201d\n\nThe question, \u201cWhat branch of technology or what branch of machinery has done most for civilization?\u201d finds a similar division of opinion, with partisans in favor of the steam engine, machine tools, electrical machinery, iron manufacture, paper making, printing, etc. Again, it is clearly evident that all have been most valuable contributors and none may carry off all the honors. However, partisans of the printing press are entitled to place that machine among the foremost because it has certainly been most useful in preserving and disseminating all classes of knowledge and in promoting the progress of civilization.\n\nEARLY CHINESE PRINTING\nIt is hardly necessary for us to refer to Johann Gutenberg\u2019s invention in 1436 of separate type for each letter. Many centuries before that the Chinese[301] had made wood engravings of complete pages and printed them on paper. Their method was to prepare an ink copy on a sheet of paper and then transfer the copy by pressing the paper on the wood before the ink was dry, after which they carved away all the surface except those parts which were inked. This gave them a reverse plate from which any number of copies could be printed. The invention of individual type which could be used over and over again for setting new copy was a marked improvement over the Chinese system.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF PRINTING PRESSES\nThe primitive screw press saw little improvement except in minor details down to the end of the eighteenth century. Then steam began to take the place of hand power and the idea was conceived of using a rotary cylinder in place of a flat press. The types were tapered so that they could be fitted about a cylinder. The paper was fed between the type cylinder and a soft impression cylinder faced with leather. The ink was applied to the type by means of a roller which was fed by an inking apparatus.\n\nIn 1814 two rotary presses were installed in the offices of the London \u201cTimes,\u201d making it possible to turn out that newspaper at the marvelous rate of 11,000 impressions per hour. In this country, Richard Marsh Hoe invented a machine in which four, six, eight, or ten impression cylinders operated on a single form of type, thereby increasing the output of the press correspondingly. The first machine, a four-impression cylinder press, was used by the Philadelphia \u201cLedger\u201d in 1846, and it printed 8,000 papers per hour.\n\n[302]\n\nNext came the \u201cperfecting\u201d press that printed on both sides of the paper, and then came the continuous web press, in which the paper was fed from a roll as a continuous sheet and, after receiving the type impression, was cut, folded, and delivered as a complete newspaper.\n\nTHE STEREOTYPE PLATE\nMeanwhile stereotyping was introduced into newspaper printing. In stereotyping an impression in plastic material is made of the type face and then a casting is made from this impression which, of course, exactly duplicates the type face. The type is thus relieved from wear in the press and it is immediately released for use in setting up other copy while the printing is done from the stereotype plate. While the use of stereotyping in book printing dates back to the eighteenth century, it was not thought practicable for newspaper printing because of the length of time taken in making the plate, but in 1861 papier-mach\u00e9 was introduced as a matrix material and a system of rapidly drying the mold was developed so that a plate could be cast in a comparatively short time; furthermore, impressions could be made from a flat face of type and then the mold could be bent so as to make curved stereotype plates for use on the cylinder presses. In newspaper work it takes but five minutes to make a stereotype plate. Stereotype metal does not stand the wear of printing very long and the plates must be renewed from time to time. This fits in well with newspaper requirements because clean cut work is not called for, and as the news keeps coming in new editions must constantly be printed, which means that new plates must be[303] made from time to time. For the finer printing of magazines and books, copper-faced electrotype plates are used in place of the soft stereotype plates of newspaper printing.\n\nMODERN NEWSPAPER PRESSES\nA modern large newspaper press is a bewildering sight to behold; there is such a vast number of rolls and cylinders, and the web of paper moves so rapidly. But, after all, the machine is multiplex rather than complex. It consists of a large number of printing cylinders, all operating in a single frame. Take, for instance, a double-octuple, color-combination press. It consists really of two separate presses, each operating on four webs of paper that feed from opposite ends toward the middle. There are two type cylinders for each web, one for each side of the paper. Each cylinder is long enough to take four stereotype plates side by side, and since each plate extends but half way around the cylinder we have eight pages printed on each side of the web. This makes sixteen pages per web or sixty-four for each half of the machine, giving a total of 128 page impressions at each turn of the cylinders. It is seldom that a 64-page paper is required, hence the webs are slit in two by a revolving knife blade and each section of the press has two folding mechanisms so that two sets of 16-page papers are printed, folded, and delivered by each section. Arrangements are provided whereby the product may consist of 32-page papers. The papers are delivered by a traveling conveyor and every fiftieth paper is pushed out ahead of the others so as to provide a simple method of keeping count of the product.\n\n[304]\n\nPRINTING 240,000 PAGES PER HOUR\nThe cylinders turn at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute which means that the paper runs through the machine at nearly 14 miles per hour. Summing up all the webs we have a total consumption of 108 miles of paper per hour. The paper is 6 feet wide and the weight of paper in an hour\u2019s run is about 18 tons and the hourly production is 150,000 sixteen-page papers. When color is used, the press will deliver 50,000 24-page papers per hour with the two outside pages printed in three colors and black. The course of the color printed web must necessarily be different from that of the plain black printed web. It must pass through a number of printings; and to prevent the moist ink from transferring to the impression rolls and from them back to a succeeding page, thus soiling or blurring the impression, an extra roll of thin paper is passed between the printed web and the impression cylinders. This acts in a measure as a blotter. The offset paper is taken up on a roll and used over and over again. It is used not only for color work, but also when fine half tone engravings are to be printed so that a cleaner impression may be obtained.\n\nThe inking system of printing press is very elaborate. It is highly essential that the ink be spread upon the type surface in just sufficient quantity to be picked up by the paper and that the ink be uniformly distributed over the whole surface. There is an ink reservoir and a set of inking rollers for each cylinder. The reservoir consists of a trough running the whole length of the cylinder. At each turn a revolving roller dips into the ink[305] and transfers a thin film of ink to a series of small rollers. These are grouped about a large roller to which they deliver the ink. The small rollers have an axial reciprocating motion whereby the ink is uniformly spread over the large roller. The latter transfers its thin coating of ink to a pair of rollers known as \u201cform rollers\u201d and these in turn deliver the ink to the printing cylinder.\n\nA SEA CAPTAIN\u2019S CONTRIBUTION\nThe folding mechanism of a printing press is interesting. The paper is first fed over a wedge-shaped form which folds the paper lengthwise and then it is given a cross-wise fold. Curiously enough the folding mechanism for printing presses was first invented by a Yankee sea captain, named Cromwell, who could not read a drawing but developed his invention by whittling out wooden models. He also contributed other valuable improvements for the printing press worked out in the same primitive way.\n\nThe rotary press was evolved especially for the printing of daily papers and for a long time magazines continued to be printed on flat-bed presses. But as the circulation of magazines grew into the hundreds of thousands it became necessary to build high speed presses to turn out these large editions. Accordingly rotary machines were constructed similar in design to newspaper presses, but with refinements to enable them to produce the better class of work required of magazine printing. Although there are many magazines still printed on flat bed presses, particularly those which publish small editions of less than a hundred thousand, all the big national weekly journals and monthly[306] magazines are printed on rotary presses and some of them even use web presses.\n\nGATHERING AND BINDING MAGAZINES\nWhen a newspaper leaves the press it is folded, cut, and ready for the news stand. Not so with the book and magazine press. There are too many pages to be handled by a single press, and, furthermore, the pages must be bound together. Some large magazines contain regularly more than 500 pages and occasionally they will run over a thousand pages. Obviously no single press could handle so many pages and it takes the product of many presses to make up a single copy. Each press prints what is known as a form or signature and these signatures from the different presses are then gathered, wire-stitched, and bound into individual copies. There are machines which will do this work of gathering and binding at the rate of sixty 1,000-page magazines or catalogues every minute. The machines are adjustable for pages of different dimensions. The forms may consist of four, eight, sixteen, or thirty-two pages. A separate compartment is provided for each signature. A large machine will handle thirty-six 32-page signatures. The compartments are kept supplied by an operator, there being usually six compartments for each operator to attend to. The bottom signature in each compartment is brought into position by a suction device which seizes the signature and draws it out, depositing it in a steel trough. Here a belt conveyor moves the signature along at the right speed to carry it before the next compartment just as a signature is being withdrawn therefrom. Thus the magazine or book is progressively built up and the[307] signatures reach the end of their course properly assembled. A very delicate adjustment is provided to insure the proper adjustment of signatures. The grippers are adjusted to receive signatures of a certain thickness. If the operator should make a mistake and put a signature of a wrong size in the compartment the whole machine would come to a standstill. The adjustment is so delicate that even a variation of a single thickness of paper is enough to operate the stop mechanism. Each assembly of signatures as it reaches the end of the trough is squared up and then bound with wire stitching. From this point it moves on to receive its cover. A thin coating of hot glue is applied to the rear edge of the signatures. The cover is automatically applied and firmly pressed into place. The finished book is then carried on out of the machine and deposited neatly on a pile of previously bound books. To operate such a machine there are required one chief operator and an assistant and six girls to feed the signatures to the compartments.\n\nSETTING TYPE BY MACHINE\nThe publication of a modern daily newspaper with its many special editions would be well nigh impossible if we still had to depend upon hand setting of type. Tens of thousands of type characters are required to make up a single newspaper page, and although skilled hand compositors work with extreme rapidity it would take a large corps of men to set type for even a small newspaper in the short time available. Speed is of prime importance in newspaper work and the task of handling thousands of little pieces of type metal and arranging them correctly into words and sentences was[308] long recognized as a serious handicap, but the problem of doing this work by machine was by no means simple one and baffled inventors for years. One of the principal difficulties lay in the size and shape of the type and another was that of justifying the lines, that is, providing just the right width of spaces between words to fill out the lines completely so that they would all be of equal length, giving a straight instead of a ragged margin to the column. After that came the problem of redistributing the type.\n\nThe first really successful composing machine was the invention of Ottmar Mergenthaler in 1888. Mergenthaler overcame the difficulties that had balked other inventors by attacking the problem from a radically new angle. Instead of setting precast type, his machine cast its own type from a set of matrices. By operating a keyboard, the matrices were assembled in a line which was justified automatically after the line was composed and then the whole line of type was cast in a single slug. Hence his machine earned the name \u201clinotype.\u201d Then the matrices were returned automatically distributed to the proper channels of the matrix magazine ready to be used over again for succeeding slugs.\n\nTHE LINOTYPE MATRIX AND SPACE BAR\n[309]\n\n\nFIG. 72\u2014A LINOTYPE MATRIX\n\nA picture of a linotype matrix is shown in Figure 72. It is a plate of brass formed with ears A at the four corners. The type mold is shown at B and of course the thickness of the matrix varies with the width of the type letter it is designed to cast. In the top of the matrix there is a V-shaped slot C formed with teeth which are designed to engage grooves in a V-shaped bar over the matrix magazine. The teeth on the matrices are variously cut away and serve as keys to the different channels of the magazine. There is a different combination of teeth for each letter of the alphabet and all matrices of the same letter have the same combination of teeth. The teeth on the distributing bar are also cut away according to various combinations. After the line has been cast the matrices are all raised by their ears and fed one by one upon the distributing bar. Each matrix moves along until it arrives over the channel it is designed to enter when it comes to a gap in the teeth of the bar that are supporting it and drops into the magazine. Although there are but seven teeth on each side of the V-shaped bar, there are more than enough combinations possible to provide a characteristic one for every key of the keyboard. A matrix always has at least one pair of teeth in engagement with the bar until it reaches the gap that lets it fall into its own special channel of the magazine. The number[310] of matrices of each character varies with the normal frequency of use of that letter. For instance, the letter e is very commonly used, and there must be many more e matrices than z matrices, but in any case the number need not be very large because the process of casting a line and redistributing the type does not take very long and the matrices are soon back in the magazine ready to be used over again. The casting and distributing operations are entirely automatic and while they are in process the compositor is setting a new line.\n\nThe method of spacing which was a later development of the linotype is also very ingenious. The compositor does not have to bother with the width of spaces required to fill out a line. He merely touches the space key at the end of each word and and a space bar drops into place. Each space bar is formed of a pair of wedges and after the line has been assembled the space bars are automatically expanded to fill out the line completely by mechanism which holds down one wedge member (A, Figure 73) and slides up the other (B).\n\nINDIVIDUAL TYPE CASTING AND COMPOSING\n[311]\n\n\nFIG. 73.\u2014A LINOTYPE SPACE BAR\n\nThe difficulties of casting the linotype slug proved a serious handicap in the earlier days of the linotype. The product of the machine could not compare in quality with precast hand-set individual type, although it served very well for newspapers; but the machine is now so far perfected that it is widely used for magazine and book composition. However before this stage of perfection was reached the demand for a machine that could do a higher grade of work led to the invention of another machine known as the \u201cmonotype.\u201d The monotype consists actually of two machines, one of which is operated by a compositor and the other operated entirely automatically by the product of the first machine. The compositor operates a keyboard and thereby cuts perforations in a long strip of paper. These perforations are arranged in characteristic groups one for each key. The perforated paper is then run through the second machine and in accordance with the various perforations the separate types are cast and assembled into justified lines. Air flowing through the perforations operates a pneumatic mechanism which brings the proper molds into position and casts the separate types. The method of justifying the lines is very interesting. As in the linotype the operator merely touches a space key at the end of each word, but at the end of the line the mechanism automatically estimates the spaces to be filled and divides this by the number of spaces so that a characteristic group of perforations is punched when the compositor shifts to[312] the next line. In the casting machine the paper ribbon runs through backward and the space group of perforations is encountered before the line is cast. This automatically adjusts the mechanism to cast spaces of the requisite size to fill out the line exactly.\n\nWRITING BY MACHINE\nIn one sense we have taken up the various machines employed in printing in reverse order. Of course the first machine used is the typewriter, after which comes the composing machine, and finally the press.\n\nIt was in 1866 that two inventors, C. Latham Sholes and Samuel W. Soule, undertook to make a machine for printing numbers in serial order upon the pages of a blankbook. Carlos Glidden, another inventor, who was engaged in developing a spading machine designed to take the place of a plow, saw their work and suggested that they make their machine write letters and words as well as numbers. The three combined and proceeded to evolve the new machine. By the end of the summer of 1867 they had produced a typewriting machine that could be operated fairly rapidly and that produced fair work. It was one of the letters written by this machine that brought James Densmore into the enterprise. He furnished the money needed to improve the crude typewriter and make it a commercial machine. Many models were built but nothing was produced that seemed good enough for commercial production. This development work was too slow and discouraging for Soule and Glidden and they dropped out, but Sholes inspired by Densmore persevered until at last in 1873 he had produced a machine which he could offer for manufacture.[313] The typewriter was then taken to the Remington factory at Ilion, N. Y., and the next year it was placed on the market and began its public career.\n\nSuch is the story of the early development of the typewriter. It has become so widely used and is so indispensable a part of the business office that it arouses the utmost astonishment to learn that there still are a few old-fashioned houses so conservative and so far behind that they continue to write their business letters with the pen. So common a machine, it is hardly necessary for us to describe in detail except to mention two steps in the development of the machine, namely the arrangement of the type bars whereby the typewriting is visible to the typist, and secondly the effort to overcome noise by limiting the stroke of the type bar and making it impinge upon the paper with a pressure stroke rather than a hammer blow.\n\nA recent development is the \u201cstenotype,\u201d a small machine which prints shorthand characters, thus expediting the taking of rapid dictation.\n\n[314]\n\nCHAPTER XX\nCAST IRON, WROUGHT IRON, AND STEEL\n\nIT USED to be that wars were fought for gold, but nowadays the possession of rich iron mines is enough to arouse the cupidity of neighboring nations less favored by nature. In fact, even though an ounce of gold is worth twice as much as a ton of iron, the value of the iron we dig out of the earth each year is far greater than that of gold. When that rough ore is converted into iron and steel and then into thousands of useful articles, its value mounts so high that it cannot be estimated. The qualities of iron and its alloys are so excellent and so varied under different treatment that this metal may truly be said to form the foundation of all our mechanical progress. On the one hand it spans our wide rivers, carries the burden of heavy freight trains, or, in the form of armor plate, resists the terrific impact of high-powered shells; on the other hand the same metal, spun into a hair spring, governs the ship\u2019s chronometer, or, in the compass, points a trembling finger to guide the navigator on his course.\n\nIRON IN ANCIENT DAYS\nThe first use of iron in the service of man dates far back into the ages. An iron tool was found in the pyramid of Kephron which must have been[315] used 3,500 years before Christ. However, because of the difficulty of working it, iron was not extensively employed except for swords and cutlery. The conversion of iron into steel and the tempering of steel blades grew to be an art which gave Damascus and Toledo a world-wide reputation that dates back over a thousand years.\n\nThe ancients used to smelt their iron ore in what was known as a Catalan forge because of its extensive use in Catalonia, Spain. Whether the forge was invented there or not we cannot say. Similar forges have been found in India and other widely remote places. They comprised an inclined tray leading to a pot which formed the furnace and in which a charcoal fire was kindled. The ore and charcoal were placed on the tray and from time to time were raked down into the furnace and air was forced into the bottom of the furnace by means of bellows. In an improved form of the Catalan forge air was furnished by means of an air compressor operated by a stream of water. This has already been referred to and illustrated on page 90. Limestone served as a flux to melt the earthy matter. The iron obtained from these primitive furnaces was not heated sufficiently to flow as a stream, but was merely reduced to a pasty mass which was then hammered into shape by the blacksmith. Ten or twelve pounds of metal per day was considered a fair output for one of these forges.\n\nDISCOVERY OF COKE\nIt was not until the middle of the 14th Century that a blast furnace, crudely similar to those we have to-day, was first built and with it a temperature was obtained that was high enough to turn the[316] metal into a liquid which could be cast in molds. Charcoal continued to be the fuel used until about four centuries later, when Abraham Darby discovered that by baking coal to remove its free gases, he could produce a new fuel known as coke which was a good substitute for charcoal. This gave a wonderful impetus to the iron industry in England where there were ample deposits of coal adjacent to the iron mines. Shortly after that, Mr. Henry Cort of Gasport, England, invented the processes of puddling and rolling the product of the blast furnace, thus converting the iron into a tough, malleable metal.\n\nALLOYS OF CARBON AND IRON\nWe must pause here to learn the difference between cast iron, wrought iron and steel. Iron, as we know, has a high affinity for oxygen. When exposed to air and moisture it oxidizes, rusts very quickly. The iron we find in nature is largely oxidized. In other words, it is rusty. It is also found in combination with other elements as well. The object of putting iron ore through a furnace is to rid it of oxygen and this is most readily accomplished by melting it in a carbon fire. The highly heated carbon combines with the oxygen and passes off as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas. But a certain amount of carbon unites with the iron and it is this alloy of carbon and iron that makes cast iron so stiff and brittle. The less carbon present the softer is the metal and pure iron is very ductile.\n\nIt was to rid cast iron of its carbon content that Cort invented the puddling process. As the metal came out of the blast furnace it ran into a \u201creverberatory\u201d furnace where, without coming[317] in contact with coke or other carbon fuel, it was exposed to flames from an adjoining furnace which burned out the carbon, and then the carbon-free iron was cast into large pieces known as blooms which were hammered to rid them of slag. The final product was known as wrought iron. Wrought iron then differs from cast iron in having no carbon. Steel, on the other hand, stands half way between wrought iron and cast iron in having a small percentage of carbon. How steel is made will be described later.\n\nMECHANICAL HANDLING OF ORE\nOf course machinery plays a large part in the modern iron industry. It would be an endless task even to load one of the big blast furnaces by hand and then the enormous output of molten metal\u201440 tons for every pound produced by the old Catalan furnaces\u2014could not be handled without ponderous machines whose huge arms and fingers are not scorched and blistered by the intense heat. Along the Great Lakes vast loading machines fill the holds of ore vessels and at the plant there are enormous unloading machines that travel on rails. These have long bridgelike arms that reach out over the ore boat and drop huge clam-shell buckets into their holds. The buckets quickly unload the boats and dump the ore on shore where other buckets pick up the ore, carry it back and pile it up in big heaps that look like mounds of reddish earth.\n\nTHE MODERN BLAST FURNACE\nBlast furnaces are towering cylindrical structures of steel lined with fire brick. They are loaded from the top with alternate layers of coke[318] and ore. Limestone also is added to act as a flux for the earthy matter, as explained above. Running around the furnace near the base there is a large pipe known as the \u201cbustle\u201d pipe. Through this air is fed to a set of \u201ctuyeres\u201d which lead to the base of the furnace and admit blasts of air requisite to maintain combustion at an intense heat. The gases of combustion are not allowed to escape freely into the atmosphere. The top of the furnace through which the ore and fuel is admitted is closed by an air lock and the flaming hot gases are led into \u201cstoves\u201d where they give up a large part of their heat to preheat the air which is pumped to the blast furnace. The gases being mainly composed of carbon monoxide are further combustible and may be used for heat, light, and power purposes. In fact, they are commonly used to drive the air compressors which feed the blast furnaces.\n\nThe blast furnace has two openings, one above the other. Through the upper one slag is drawn off while the molten iron which trickles down and collects at the bottom of the furnace is tapped off through a hole near the base of the furnace. The fiery stream pours out into a lot of small trough-shaped molds and is thus formed into \u201cpigs.\u201d These pigs are all connected to the main body of the metal stream and must be broken off. To save the time of cooling and of breaking off the pigs a machine is used which consists of a series of molds connected to form an endless belt. The molten iron is poured into these molds which in their course dip into a trough of water. Here the iron is cooled and solidified. The molds then run up an incline and finally dump the pigs directly into railway cars which haul them away.\n\n[319]\n\nBURNING OUT THE CARBON\nThe production of steel economically and on a large scale dates back to the inventions of Henry Bessemer. While searching for an improved method of making big guns, Bessemer hit upon the idea of forcing a blast of air through the molten iron and thus burning away carbon, silicon, and manganese in the cast iron. No fuel was supplied except the carbon and silicon in the iron itself. In burning out this carbon sufficient heat was generated to keep the metal fluid.\n\nWhen Bessemer made the announcement of his new process before the British Association in 1856, his paper met with skepticism, but he was able to demonstrate by actual experiment that cast iron could be converted into malleable iron in this way. However, when several firms operating under licenses from the inventor endeavored to reproduce his experiment on a commercial scale they were unsuccessful, and after costly experiments the process was given up as a failure. Bessemer, however, persisted in his efforts and succeeded eventually in producing malleable iron of a quality equal if not superior to that on the market. But iron makers after the failure of the first experiments would have nothing to do with the new process until Bessemer began to turn out quantities of iron at $100 a ton below the prevailing market price. Then iron makers woke up and Bessemer had no difficulty in placing his process with numbers of firms on a very profitable royalty basis.\n\nThis process pertained to the making of iron and not steel. When Bessemer tried to produce steel he was confronted with serious difficulties. The steel[320] he obtained was very brittle. He tried purer ores with little better success. Then a solution of his problem was offered by Robert F. Mushet, who discovered a compound which would be added to the molten metal to purify it. This compound which is known as \u201cspiegeleisen\u201d is composed of iron, carbon, and manganese. It removes the oxide of iron and the sulphur and regulates the amount of carbon in the steel.\n\nA Bessemer converter furnishes by far the most spectacular operation in steel manufacture. The converter consists of a large bottle-shaped vessel lined with refractory material. In the bottom of the vessel there are openings through which the air blast is admitted. The molten metal is poured into the flask and then the air blast is turned on. The metal begins to boil violently. A dazzlingly brilliant blast of flame and sparks comes roaring out of the mouth of the converter. Bubbles of metal are thrown high into the air where they burst into showers of sparks. The effect is similar to that of a volcanic eruption. In from ten to twenty minutes the eruption subsides and then a quantity of spiegeleisen is added. The converter is mounted on trunnions so that when the operation is completed the vessel is tilted over and the charge of molten metal now converted into steel is poured out.\n\nOPEN HEARTH FURNACES\n\nMOLTEN METAL FROM A BLAST FURNACE\n\n\nBESSEMER CONVERTER BLOWING AIR THROUGH A MASS OF MOLTEN IRON\n\n\nA STEEL BEAM PASSING THROUGH THE FINISHING ROLLS OF A STEEL MILL\n\n[321]\n\n\nFIG. 74.\u2014SECTIONAL VIEW OF A REGENERATIVE OPEN-HEARTH FURNACE\n\nWhile the Bessemer converter provides a very economical and expeditious method of converting cast iron into steel, it is difficult to regulate the carbon content with great accuracy and hence the use of the open-hearth furnaces which furnish a slower method of burning out the carbon. Figure 74 is a diagrammatic representation of such a furnace. Below the hearth of the furnace there are two pairs of chambers, A, B and C, D, filled with a checkerwork of bricks. Gas is passed through one chamber A, and air through the other B, and they combine to form a very intense flame above the hearth E in which the metal is placed. The burnt gases pass over and through the other pair of chambers, C, D, on their way to the stack. By this means the bricks in the latter chambers are raised to a white heat. Then the process is reversed; air flows through the hot checkerwork of bricks in the chamber C and gas through the hot checkerwork in chamber D, and after combustion in the furnace the burnt gases are drawn through the bricks of the first pair of chambers. By alternating the direction[322] of flow the air and gas fed to the furnace are always preheated by the stored-up heat of the previously burned gases. While it takes but a few minutes to convert cast iron into steel in the Bessemer converter, the open-hearth process occupies from eight to twelve hours.\n\nThe steel produced in the open-hearth furnaces is poured into ingot molds. These are approximately rectangular in section and slightly larger at the bottom than at the top. They are open at the top and bottom, but at the bottom rest upon a base plate. As soon as the steel has hardened the plunger of a stripping machine holds down the glowing ingot while a pair of hooks lift off the mold, leaving the ingot resting on the base plate.\n\nROLLING INGOTS INTO RAILS\nIn the manufacture of railroad rails the ingots are placed on a traveling \u201ctable\u201d consisting of a series of rapidly turning rollers. These carry the ingot to a pair of large steel rolls between which it passes. The rolls compress the ingot slightly and it is automatically turned over and passed through a second pair of rolls. After passing through four \u201cstands\u201d of rolls, turning over between each stand, it is considerably reduced in cross-sectional area and correspondingly lengthened. It is now termed a \u201cbloom.\u201d The bloom goes through a series of rollers which gradually reduce its section until it is some forty feet long. Then it is cut in two and each section passes through other rolls, until finally it is reduced to the required rail section. Each section is then about a hundred and twenty feet long and the glowing writhing rail passes on to the saws where it is cut into ten-yard lengths. A similar[323] process is employed in rolling other forms of rails and in making steel plates and sheets.\n\nSTEEL FOR BIG GUNS\nThe largest machines employed in the steel industry are those used for the manufacture of armor and big guns. A modern large high-powered gun is not a single solid casting or forging, but is made up of a series of steel tubes that are shrunk one upon another so that the inner tube is compressed. The reason for this is that the explosives used are so powerful that they would expand the inner tube or lining of the gun beyond its elastic limit and in that way enlarge the bore. By having it compressed to start with it can expand farther without exceeding the elastic limit. This expansion takes place so suddenly that the lining rebounds or returns to its original dimensions before the outer tubes have felt the full pressure and they too are thus prevented from being expanded too far. In some cases the compression is effected by winding the gun with a heavy wire of rectangular cross section.\n\nSQUEEZING OUT THE \u201cPIPES\u201d\nSteel for guns and armor is made in the open-hearth furnace where the quality of the metal may be regulated to a nicety. Gun tubes are cast in vertical molds and during the cooling of the ingot it is subjected to pressure so as to prevent segregation and the forming of \u201cpipes.\u201d Pipes are cavities that are liable to form in the center of the ingot due to contraction during cooling. Steel, as we have learned, is not pure iron, but an alloy, and the various constituents have different temperatures of solidifying, consequently they exhibit a tendency to[324] segregate. It is to overcome such tendencies that a so-called \u201cfluid\u201d compressor is used. This is virtually a hydraulic press with a plunger that bears down on the fluid metal as it is solidifying. Modern big guns are enormously large. A sixteen-inch 50-caliber gun, for instance, is nearly seventy feet long, consequently the ingot must be even longer than this and the fluid compressor for so large a piece must be correspondingly powerful. After the ingot has been cast and cooled, the ends are cut off and it is bored to form a tube. Then it is placed in a furnace and raised to a white heat, after which a bar or mandrel is inserted in the bore and the tube is placed under the hydraulic forge press. This is a very powerful machine with an immense hammer that is actuated by hydraulic pressure. The stroke of the hammer is carefully regulated so that the forging as it is turned in the forge is subjected to equal blows. In the forge the tube is roughly formed to the dimensions it is eventually to have when finished. The process of forging subjects the metal to strains which must be relieved and so the tube has to go to the annealing oven where it is raised to a temperature which destroys crystallization. In this oven it is allowed to cool very slowly, letting the molecules of the metal adjust and rearrange themselves. When the temperature of the tube has been lowered to a certain point it is taken out and plunged into a bath of oil. This sudden cooling tempers the metal, giving it a high degree of elasticity and tensile strength. Again the tube must be annealed to relieve it of any strains occasioned by the tempering, and then it goes to the shop to receive its finish boring and turning.\n\n[325]\n\nThe process as here briefly described seems simple enough, but we must not forget the enormous size of these pieces and their tremendous weight. They would be difficult enough to handle when cold, but much of the work is done while the pieces are at a white heat so that the men who control and operate the machinery that handles the big forgings must keep their distance. The casting, annealing, and tempering operations are performed with the piece in vertical position, and lofty machines and cranes are required to deal with these tall castings. A visit to a plant which manufactures big guns is bound to impress the visitor with awe and give him increased respect for the men who are able to handle such huge masses of metal and also for the men who have conceived and developed such gigantic operations.\n\n[326]\n\nCHAPTER XXI\nANIMATED MACHINERY\n\nIN MARKED contrast to the massive machinery and apparatus described in the last chapter, and fully as wonderful, is a class of machinery to which we might apply the term \u201canimated.\u201d By this we do not mean manikins or toys, but certain higher types of machines which seem to be possessed of powers that we should expect to find only in living beings\u2014machines that have a sense of touch, sight, and hearing\u2014machines that will reason out a mathematical problem; that will talk; that have the equivalent of a memory. In this broad classification we may include such widely different machines as the motion-picture camera and projector, and that mysterious mechanism which seems animated with strange powers of its own\u2014- the gyroscope.\n\nMATHEMATICAL MACHINES\nAdding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and the working out of complex mathematical problems by machine seems wonderful until we stop to reflect that mathematics is the most precise and mechanical of all sciences. In the simpler forms these machines are mere counting mechanisms in which the counting is done very rapidly by the aid of intermeshing gears. The adding machine is in no sense possessed of any reasoning power, but blindly obeys the simplest of mechanical laws.[327] There are rows of wheels with numbers running from 0 to 9 printed on their peripheries. One wheel represents \u201cdigits,\u201d the next \u201ctens,\u201d the next \u201chundreds,\u201d etc. The wheels are interconnected by means of gearing so that when the digits wheel makes a complete turn, the tens wheel makes 1-10th of a turn, and when the tens wheel completes a rotation the hundreds wheel makes 1-10th of a turn. Keys numbered from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c9\u201d are provided, which respectively turn each wheel through angles from 1-10th to 10-10ths of a rotation. Thus suppose the digit wheel has already been turned through 9-10ths of a rotation and registers the figure \u201c9,\u201d and the \u201c8\u201d key is depressed, the wheel will be given an additional turn of 8-10ths of a rotation and will register the figure \u201c7,\u201d but the tens wheel to the left will also move through 1-10th of a rotation, so that the two wheels will register \u201c17.\u201d Such is the underlying principle of the adding machine, but various refinements are added. For instance, the numbers that are being added are recorded in print, and the total sum of the numbers is not printed until the operator desires to foot up the column.\n\nMore complicated, of course, are the mathematical machines which work out involved equations, but they are all based on simple mechanical operations. In the Weather Bureau at Washington there is a tide-predicting machine, which has been called a \u201cgreat brass brain.\u201d Its brass gears may be set to allow for all the varying factors of apparent solar and lunar motions, and they will work out the tide for any past or future data in a few moments, solving mechanically a mathematical problem that, by hand, would take hours and hours of weary figuring.\n\n[328]\n\nHEARING AND TALKING WITH A MECHANICAL \u201cEAR\u201d\nIt was in 1877 that Edison startled the world with a machine that could actually talk. Others had been working on this problem for years, but they had been trying to copy the human mouth and organs of speech. Edison attacked the problem from a new angle. He was not aiming to produce speech but to reproduce it. Let the human vocal organs modulate the sound waves so that they would produce spoken words; he would provide a machine with no mouth but only an ear and a very retentive memory which would listen to these sound waves and make an impression of them on its soft tinfoil or wax brain. Then, at any time by the principle of \u201creversal,\u201d the record could be made the transmitter instead of the receiver of sound waves, and it would actuate the ear so that it would repeat the sound vibrations it had formerly received. Thus Edison made the ear of his machine serve the double office of hearing and talking. When Edison\u2019s phonograph was listening it had a sharp needle attached to the ear-drum or diaphragm of the sound box, which cut a hill and dale groove in the brain or cylinder record of the machine; when reproducing, a blunt needle was used which faithfully followed the hills and dales of the groove without cutting a path of its own.\n\nThe next notable improvement in the phonograph was that of Emile Berliner, who in 1887 invented the laterally vibrating needle which cut a zigzag groove in the record instead of a hill-and-dale groove. In other words, instead of having his recording needle move in and out as in the Edison[329] machine, it moved sidewise. He also invented the flat-disk record, which has almost completely supplanted the cylindrical record.\n\nMACHINES THAT PICTURE MOTION\nIn a measure associated with the phonograph is the motion-picture machine, a machine with an eye and a retentive memory, which records on a sensitive retina a series of pictures that it is able to reproduce at any time. The recording of still photographs is remarkable enough in itself, but photography does not properly belong in a book on machinery. The taking of motion pictures, however, and the projection of these pictures upon the screen, involves the use of machinery, and we must refer to these machines briefly, owing to their widespread use at the present time.\n\nLong years ago it was observed that when a picture is suddenly flashed before the eye an image is impressed upon the retina, which persists for a brief interval even after the picture itself has been withdrawn from view. By preparing a series of pictures of a figure which show it in progressive positions and flashing these pictures in rapid succession before the eye, persistence of vision will bridge the gaps between pictures and the figure will appear to move. This principle was first used as early as 1834 in an ingenious toy known as \u201czoetrope,\u201d which consisted of a cardboard cylinder with a series of pictures drawn on the inner surface. There were slots cut in the cylinder through which these pictures on the opposite face of the cylinder could be seen. As the cylinder was revolved the eye caught only momentary glimpses of these pictures, one after the other, producing a sense of[330] motion. In 1870, Henry Heyl of Philadelphia prepared a progressive series of photographs each separately posed before the camera. From these he made glass positives and projected them on a screen in rapid succession so that the picture appeared to move. In 1880, Edward Muybridge set up a battery of cameras and took a succession of instantaneous pictures of a galloping horse. The shutters were operated by strings stretched across the course and as these were successively snapped by the horse the pictures were progressively exposed. Glass positives of these pictures were thrown on the screen by means of a machine to which he gave the formidable name \u201czo\u00f6praxiscope.\u201d\n\nINVENTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM\nNo one at that early date had thought of using anything but glass plates, and they were difficult to handle, both in the camera and in the projector. It was not until 1887 that the celluloid film was invented by Rev. Hannibal Goodwin, and then it became possible for Edison to invent a camera with a film that was intermittently moved so as to take a series of pictures. From the negative thus obtained a positive film was then made and placed in a machine known as a \u201ckinetoscope.\u201d Looking through a peephole in this machine the pictures were flashed before the eye in rapid succession. Finally, in 1893, C. Francis Jenkins, of Washington, developed a projector similar to those now in use by which the pictures could be thrown on a screen. Thus was born the motion-picture industry which has taken such a strong hold on the public.\n\nIt is now possible to project pictures in their natural color so as to add to their realism, but one[331] more step is needed to give a sense of real life. The figures on the screen must talk as well as move. Efforts to combine the phonograph with motion pictures have so far been only partially successful. Perfect synchronism is very difficult to obtain, but it is highly probable that obstacles which hitherto have been most troublesome and seemingly insurmountable will, in time, be overcome. Then the \u201csilent drama\u201d will no longer be silent and we shall have \u201canimated pictures\u201d that will be really animated.\n\nIn addition to machines that talk we have machines that hear\u2014machines that will respond to sound waves. A diaphragm flexed by sound waves closes an electric circuit and starts the operation of a machine. Some toys have been made which operate on this principle. Experiments have been made with a typewriter that will respond to a spoken message, but so far they have not been attended with much success. Boats have been built whose steering gear may be controlled by sound waves, but as yet nothing of commercial importance has been developed in machines controlled by sound.\n\nMACHINES THAT SEE\nMuch more has been done with machines that see. There is a delicate device known as a \u201csun valve,\u201d which is used on beacon lights so that as soon as it grows dark or very foggy the lamp is automatically lighted, and when the day dawns or light breaks through the fog the light is extinguished. The sun valve has two rods, one brightly polished and the other a dead black. Light and its attendant radiant heat waves are absorbed by the black rod, but are reflected from the bright rod.[332] As a consequence, the black rod grows hotter than the polished rod and expands. The difference of expansion between the two rods is utilized to operate a valve which controls the supply of gas to the lamp. This valve is very sensitive and marvelously responsive to variations of light.\n\nThere is a chemical element called selenium, which is peculiarly sensitive to light. When light shines upon selenium its electrical resistance is lowered, and hence it can be used as a light-operated valve to control the flow of electric current.\n\nA MACHINE THAT READS PRINT\nOne of the most marvelous machines of the present day is one which will actually read ordinary printed type, uttering musical sounds that vary for each letter, so that a blind man after learning this new musical language can read any book. This machine, known as the optophone, is the invention of Prof. E. Fournier d\u2019Albe, and was developed to a commercial success last year (1920). With it blind operators are able to read at the rate of twenty-five words per minute.\n\nThe operation of this wonderful machine can best be understood by reference to the accompanying diagrams, Figures 75 and 76.\n\n[333]\n\n\nDiagrammatic Arrangement of Optophone.\n\nFIG. 75.\u2014END VIEW OF THE OPTOPHONE\tFIG. 76.\u2014SIDE VIEW OF THE OPTOPHONE\nThere is an electric lamp in the machine before which there is a disk that is revolved by a small motor. In this disk there are five circular rows of slots and the light shining through these slots is cut up into five pulsating beams of light. These beams are brought to a focus in a vertical row upon the type page. From the paper they are reflected to a selenium cell or bridge. The selenium bridge forms part of the circuit of a telephone receiver and the diaphragm is thus made to vibrate at the same frequency as the light beams do. By varying the number of slots in each row in the disk the beams of light are given different periods of pulsation or vibration and they produce a sound chord or \u201cscala\u201d in the telephone receiver. The speed of the disk and the disposition of the slots is so chosen that the notes produced are G C\u2032 D\u2032 E\u2032 G\u2032 of the musical scale. Only white paper reflects the light beams; the black surface of the printed type absorbs them. Thus, as the row of beams is swept across a line of printed matter, the beams will be extinguished in various orders of succession, or simultaneously in accordance with the shape of the particular type-character they encounter.\n\n[334]\n\nThe middle three beams correspond to notes C\u2032, D\u2032 and E\u2032, and play upon the small letters, while G\u2032 plays up the upper part of capital letters, and G upon the tails of such letters as y, p, etc. If the scala passes over the letter \u201cV,\u201d for instance, first the top note G\u2032 is silenced, then E\u2032, D\u2032, C\u2032, D\u2032, E\u2032 and G\u2032 in succession. This arrangement constitutes what is known as the \u201cwhite sounding\u201d optophone, because the full chord is sounded constantly, except when the type matter is encountered.\n\nTo simplify the reading an improved type of optophone has been made, which is known as the \u201cblack-reading\u201d optophone, With this machine there is no sound produced except when the type is encountered. The letter \u201cV\u201d is then identified by the sounding, instead of the silencing of the notes G\u2032, E\u2032, D\u2032, C\u2032, E\u2032 and G\u2032. The letter \u201cA\u201d produces the sounds C\u2032, D\u2032, DE\u2032, DG\u2032, DE\u2032, D\u2032 and C\u2032. This result is obtained by using two selenium bridges, as shown better in the side view, Figure 76. There is a concave reflecting lens, which reflects half of the light upon the second cell, known as the balancer selenium bridge. Electric current passing through the balancer opposes the current passing through the main selenium bridge, and hence there is silence in the telephone receiver when the scala passes over plain white paper, but when type is encountered and certain of the beams are not reflected against the main selenium bridge the sounds are produced through the balancer bridge.\n\nThe success of the optophone leads one to hope that it may be but the forerunner of a machine that will translate the whole world of light and color into one of music, and permit the blind not only to read by ear, but also to see their friends and their[335] surroundings through the sense of hearing. In fact efforts to make such an apparatus preceded the invention of the optophone.\n\nTHE WILLFUL GYROSCOPE\nAs intimated above, we have included the gyroscope among the higher type of machines, because it seems possessed of a stubborn will of its own, and apparently defies the laws of gravity.\n\nThere is nothing mysterious about its mechanism. It is merely a wheel with a heavy rim and with its axis mounted in gimbals, so that it may turn freely in any direction. The wheel, when at rest, behaves no differently from any other mechanism. But once the wheel is set to spinning at a high velocity it seems to acquire marvelous powers and obstinate notions of its own as to what it will do and what it won\u2019t do. You may lift it, or lower it, or move it sideways in any direction, and it will not show the least sign of rebellion so long as the plane of its rotation is not deflected, but attempt to twist its plane of rotation and it will resist with the power of a giant. The resistance that even a small gyroscope will develop is astounding. A wheel weighing not more than 10 pounds may develop so much energy that a man twenty times as heavy pushing with all his might cannot turn it over. Not only does it resist the push, but it actually leans back against the pusher. Then it has the peculiar habit of turning at right angles to the direction in which it is pushed. Suppose, for instance, the axis of the gyroscope is horizontal and it is resting freely on a pair of supports, one at each end. Remove one of the supports and the gyroscope does not fall. To do so it would have to[336] swing around the other point of support as a center; in other words, the plane of rotation would have to be turned angularly and such a motion the gyroscope resists. The unsupported end of the axis dips momentarily under the pull of gravity, but immediately recovers and actually rises above the horizontal, then it begins to revolve slowly in a horizontal circle about the supported end of the axis\u2014a motion which is technically known as \u201cprecession\u201d. The pull of gravity exerted in a downward direction results in a horizontal motion at right angles thereto. It seems as if the gyroscope was bidding defiance to laws that govern other objects, but, of course, such is not the case. The gyroscope is as submissively obedient to the laws of gravity as any other object or machine, but the forces which act upon it are so complicated that it is difficult for one to comprehend them without study. In fact, it is almost impossible to explain the strange behavior of a gyroscope without the use of mathematics that is too involved to be presented in this book.\n\nOf course, the underlying cause of gyroscopic action is inertia; i. e., the tendency of a body to retain its state of rest or uniform motion. A bullet is forced out of a gun by the sudden expansion of gases behind it, but after it leaves the muzzle and the influence of the gases, why does it keep on traveling? We may just as well reverse the question and ask why it should ever stop. Having once acquired a certain velocity it keeps that velocity because of its inertia or mechanical helplessness, and it would keep on going forever were it not for the resistance offered by the air and the pull of gravity, which gradually draws it down to earth.[337] It takes a deal of energy to divert the bullet from its course. In a gyroscope we have a similar condition.\n\nFORCES DEVELOPED IN A GYROSCOPE\nWe may conceive of a gyroscope as consisting of a stream of bullets all tied to a center, so that they fly around in a circle. Any effort to deflect the bullets out of their course will be resisted by each bullet as it comes to the deflector. Here each bullet acts individually, but in a gyroscope wheel the equivalent of the stream of bullets is a solid rim, each particle of which is rigidly connected to every other particle, and so the whole wheel immediately feels the deflecting force and resists it. As long as the wheel is maintained in its own plane of rotation, or moved into parallel planes, there is such a perfect balance of all forces that no more resistance is offered to the motion of the wheel as a whole than would be offered by any other object of equal mass. But when the wheel\u2019s plane of rotation is moved angularly, a complicated series of forces is developed.\n\n[338]\n\n\nFIG. 77.\u2014SOME OF THE FORCES DEVELOPED IN A GYROSCOPE WHEN ITS PLANE OF ROTATION IS SUBJECTED TO ANGULAR MOTION\n\nSome idea of the nature of these forces and why they give rise to precession may be understood by reference to the diagram, Figure 77. Here we have a disk with a heavy rim turning on the axis X, X\u2032. At A, B, C and D are four particles whose flights we are going to consider. Suppose the wheel to be at rest; then if X, X\u2032 is tilted in the direction of the arrows x x\u2032, the wheel will turn about the line Y Y\u2032; D will move forward toward D\u2032, and B backward toward B\u2032, but A and C will remain where they are. Now, suppose, the wheel to be revolving clockwise, or in the direction A, B, C, D, then the particle A will pursue a spiral course that will bring it to B\u2032, and C will pursue a spiral course that will bring it to D\u2032. However, particle D will have an irregular course, as indicated by the dotted line, starting first to move forward and then curving back toward A. The same will be true of B, except in the reverse direction. The course of particles D and B is, therefore, materially different from that of A and C. Now, the particle D will resist being deflected from its course and will develop an opposing force represented by the arrow d. A moment later this is reversed as the particle bends back toward the axis Y Y\u2032, and we may represent the new force by the arrow d\u2032. It may be proved that the force d\u2032 is more powerful than that of d. The particle A in the meantime exerts a force opposing its deflection, which is represented by the arrow a. On the other half of the wheel there are similar but opposite forces, b, b\u2032 and c. The sum of these forces gives the wheel a tendency to turn about the axis Z Z\u2032. To avoid[339] complicating our diagram with too many arrows, we had better refer to a new diagram (Figure 78) which shows only the resultant of the forces developed. The application of the forces x x\u2032, which would have turned the wheel on the axis Y Y\u2032, had it been stationary, have resulted in the development of forces z z\u2032 at right angles to x x\u2032, tending to turn the wheel about the axis Z Z\u2032. Now, if we go through the same processes of reasoning as before, it will be evident that the forces z z\u2032 will result in a third set of forces y y\u2032 at right angles to z z\u2032 tending to turn the wheel about the axis Y Y\u2032. The forces y y\u2032 exactly balance the forces x x\u2032, and hence the wheel does not turn about the axis Y Y\u2032 in response to the original forces, but starts instead to revolve slowly about the axis Z Z. Because the forces x x\u2032 and y y\u2032 balance each other, there is no fourth couple developed and hence no opposition to the forces z z\u2032.\n\n\nFIG. 78.\u2014DIAGRAM EXPLAINING PRECESSIONAL MOVEMENT OF A GYROSCOPE\n\nThe gyroscope was used as a toy ages ago. The top, which is one form of gyroscope, was a favorite plaything of ancient Egypt. But although known[340] these many centuries, it is only in the past few years that any real effort has been made to set the top to work. Because it persists in maintaining its plane of rotation it has proved most useful on submarine torpedoes to control the rudder and hold the torpedo on a true course to its target.\n\nTHE GYROSCOPE AS A COMPASS\nAnother most important use for the gyroscope is found in the submarine itself. The needle of a magnetic compass is kept pointing north by action of the magnetic lines of force which surround this earth. Whenever a large mass of iron is placed near the compass the magnetic field is distorted and the compass needle is deflected from the true north. On modern steel vessels the compass has to be carefully corrected by using iron masses to counterbalance other disturbing masses. However, in a submarine the whole shell of the vessel is of steel and the magnetic lines of force flow along this shell. The compass needle is virtually insulated from the terrestrial magnetism by the surrounding steel hull. But, fortunately, the gyroscope may be used as a compass and it is in no way affected by magnetism. Once the gyroscope is set spinning with its axis pointing to the North Pole of the heavens it will continue to point in that direction no matter how devious a course the vessel may pursue. If pointed in some other direction, the precessional forces set up by the rotation of the earth will turn it due north. As the vessel rolls or pitches, disturbing precessional movements are likely to be set up. These are overcome by special mechanism, so that the gyroscopic compass may now be depended upon as a perfectly reliable instrument.\n\n[341]\n\nPREVENTING SHIPS FROM ROLLING\nOne of the most remarkable recent developments of the gyroscope is its use as a stabilizer in ships to keep them from rolling in a heavy sea. A comparatively small wheel is mounted in the hold of the vessel with perfect freedom to turn in any direction. If the wheel is clamped so that it cannot precess, the vessel will roll and pitch, but the instant the gyroscope is released it exerts its wonderful powers. The ship rides smoothly and its groaning and creaking ceases, showing that it is no longer subjected to severe strains. Of course, it rises and falls with the waves, but it maintains an even keel as if sailing in smooth water. The object of stabilizing a ship is not merely to cater to the comfort of passengers who are subject to seasickness, but to save wear and tear on the vessel and also to economize time and fuel. An unstabilized ship riding a heavy sea pursues a very sinuous course; in other words, it must travel farther than it would in smooth water. The rudder must constantly be turned to keep the ship on its course, and this acts as a drag on the progress of the ship, slowing it down and wasting the power of the engine. As the ship wallows in the sea it displaces much more water than it does when riding on an even keel and here there is a further loss. It has been estimated that a 15,000-ton vessel running at 18 knots may waste as much as 1,000 to 1,200 horsepower in a heavy sea. If stabilized with a gyroscope, practically all this wasted horsepower would be saved at the expense of a very small amount of power used in keeping the gyroscope spinning.\n\n[342]\n\nThe first man to stabilize a ship with a gyroscope was Dr. Schlick, who demonstrated the powers of this mysterious mechanism in 1906. His stabilizer, however, was not sensitive enough to provide perfect stabilizing. The ship had to roll some before the gyroscope exerted its corrective forces. Recently, however, Mr. Elmer A. Sperry has improved the stabilizer, making it so sensitive that there is practically no rolling or pitching of the vessel.\n\nCuriously enough, the gyroscope may be used not only to keep a ship from rolling, but also to make it roll. Should a vessel run upon a mud flat it may be rocked by braking or accelerating the precessional motion of the gyroscope. In this way the ship may work itself out of the mud bank. Ice breakers are equipped with gyroscopes, so that they may be rolled to prevent them from being frozen into an ice pack and to assist them in crushing their way through the ice.\n\nTHE MONO-RAIL CAR\nIn 1907 a sensation was created by the exhibition of a car which ran on a single rail. The inventor of this monorail car was Mr. Louis Brennan. The public was astonished at the ease with which this car maintained its balance on the rail, leaning in as it rounded a curve to keep its equilibrium. Passengers could move about at will without the slightest danger of upsetting the car; in fact, if a heavy weight was placed on one side of the car that side would rise rather than fall. The car could run with equal ease upon a cable of a crooked pipe line. The gyroscope that maintained the balance of the car consisted of a couple of small wheels which[343] revolved in a vacuum chamber at the rate of 7,000 revolutions per minute. Once started, little power was required to keep them going. Interesting as this car was, it did not offer sufficient advantages over the present-day double rail cars and locomotives to justify its development on a commercial scale. Although witnesses of the exhibition marveled at the strange spectacle of this mechanical tight-rope walker, they did not realize that they themselves had had gyroscopic cars in their midst for years. The gyroscopic action of the wheels of a motorcycle is very marked. It is this action which is mainly responsible for holding the machine upright. The same is true of a bicycle, although the gyroscopic effect is not quite so marked, because of the lower velocity of the wheels. However, we all know that any tendency for the machine to fall to one side or the other may be corrected by a slight turn of the front wheel in that direction which at once has the effect of bringing the bicycle back to vertical position.\n\nTHE AUTOMATIC AEROPLANE PILOT\nStill another recent development of the gyroscope is its use as an \u201cautomatic pilot\u201d on aeroplanes. Two sensitive gyroscopes are used to stabilize the aeroplane. If a gust of wind tends to tilt the machine, the gyroscopes immediately sense the deviation and by closing electrical circuits operate the ailerons to bring the machine back to a horizontal plane.\n\nAn aviator possesses a certain sense of balance which is highly developed by experience and long practice, but at its best it does not begin to compare with sense of balance possessed by the gyroscope. Not only will it keep the machine from[344] tipping laterally, but it will also hold it on a level keel and can be used to steer the aeroplane in any desired direction, so that the human pilot may surrender the helm to the faithful mechanical pilot with perfect confidence in the ability of this animated machine to hold the aeroplane on a true course despite the vagaries of the wind. While this is theoretically possible, in practice certain difficulties are encountered which up to the present have prevented gyroscopic control of aeroplanes from being entirely successful.\n\n[345]\n\nCHAPTER XXII\nHEAT VACUUMS\n\nIN THE preceding chapter we dealt with high temperatures and their employment in melting, molding, and working steel into useful forms. It will be well for us to pause here to consider temperatures at the other end of the thermometer scale, how they are obtained, and the important part they play in modern civilization.\n\nIt is not absolutely correct to speak of producing \u201ccold.\u201d We are apt to forget that cold is merely absence of heat. Strictly speaking, there is nothing cold on earth. Everything is more or less hot. A piece of ice at 32 degrees F. is hot compared with a lump of frozen alcohol, and the latter at its freezing point is hot compared with a lump of frozen air, while air at its freezing point is hot compared with a lump of solid helium. In other words, frozen alcohol will be melted by the heat in the ice; frozen air will be melted by the heat in frozen alcohol, and frozen helium will be fused by the heat in frozen air. Everything contains heat, and one object is colder than another only because it contains less heat.\n\nOf course, the temperature of ice may vary. One block of ice may be ten, fifty, or a hundred degrees warmer than another, but ice cannot be heated above 32 degrees F. at the normal pressure of the atmosphere.\n\n[346]\n\nIce is really a partial heat vacuum, a chamber partially exhausted, into which heat will flow if it gets a chance. We pack it away in sawdust, granulated cork, or other materials through which heat can with difficulty penetrate, and then in hot weather cakes of ice are placed in our household refrigerators, so that the heat that is in our food will have something to flow into. When we place our hands near a cake of ice, they feel cool and it seems as if ice radiated cold just as a stove radiates heat; but, of course, such is not the case. The heat of our hands radiates more rapidly in the direction of the cake of ice than in other directions, because there is a partial heat vacuum for the heat to flow into and the result is a sensation of cold.\n\nWe no longer depend upon cold winters for our supply of ice. We have learned how to pump heat and we can make heat vacuums, anywhere and at any time, even in the heart of the tropics, and regions in which no natural ice is ever obtainable have the benefits of refrigeration. Furthermore, we are not dependent upon ice for cooling foods. In many cases it is not necessary or even desirable to reduce temperatures to the freezing point of water. A moderate chilling is all that is required for certain foods. By the proper use of refrigerating machinery any degree of temperature may be obtained and maintained. To-day small refrigerating plants are constructed for domestic purposes, so as to render the housewife independent of the ice man.\n\nWith refrigerator cars and refrigerating plants on shipboard, fruit from the far west and from tropical lands may be brought to our breakfast[347] table. Meats from northern slaughterhouses may be transported in perfect condition into hot southern climes. There are also certain industries which are dependent on the use of the low temperatures. In breweries, dairies, margarine factories, etc., refrigeration is of the utmost importance, and refrigerating machinery is used for cooling and drying the air blast for blast furnaces.\n\nIn some few places refrigerating machinery is used to cool buildings in warm weather and make life more bearable in summer weather. It is highly probable that refrigeration of dwellings will be more and more extensively developed. In winter time we can make the climate in our houses anything we please. Why should we not control the indoor climate in summer time as well?\n\nABSOLUTE ZERO\nThe volume of a gas varies inversely in accordance with the pressure to which it is subjected, and also directly according to the temperature. If we start with a gas at the freezing point (32 degrees F.) and reduce its temperature 1 degree (or to 31 degrees F.), we find that the volume of the gas is reduced 1/492.6 of its original volume, provided, of course, that we do not vary the pressure on it. In fact, for every reduction of 1 degree below the freezing point there is a reduction of 1/492.6 of its volume, and for every degree of increased temperature there is an increase of 1/492.6 of the volume. From this it is assumed that at 492.6 degrees below the freezing point, or 460.6 degrees below zero F., we will reach the absolute zero, or the point at which there is no more heat in the gas.\n\n[348]\n\nWe have not yet succeeded in reaching the extreme of low temperature, although we have come very near it in laboratory experiments. Helium is liquefied at -448 degrees F., which is very near to the absolute zero. At the other end of the scale we have attained enormously high temperatures. The heat of the electric arc, for instance, is between 6,500 and 7,200 degrees F., and that is the highest degree of temperature that we have been able so far to attain.\n\nHuman life occupies a very limited zone in this range of temperatures. We must maintain our blood at a temperature of 98 degrees F. A variation of 8 degrees either way is fatal. By piling on heat insulators, such as fur clothing, to retain the heat of our bodies and keep it from flowing out too rapidly, we can maintain the blood temperature at 98 while the surrounding atmosphere may be 70 or 80 degrees below zero. There are internal fires within us that generate heat which radiates from the body, and by checking this radiation by suitable clothing we can maintain our blood at the normal temperature.\n\nBut what can we do when the surrounding temperature is higher than blood heat? The outside heat may be kept from flowing in by surrounding ourselves with heat-insulating clothing, but the internal heat then has no means of radiating away from our bodies; it accumulates, and we become overheated. However, Nature provides a cooling system in the perspiration which oozes from our pores, and as this evaporates it cools the skin and enables us to maintain our normal blood heat, although submerged in an atmosphere of a higher temperature. If the air is dry, the evaporation is[349] more rapid and the cooling is greater than in a moist atmosphere. That is why a temperature of 105 degrees on our Western plains may be more endurable than a temperature of 95 degrees in the moist atmosphere of New York. The importance of keeping down the temperature of the blood is particularly appreciated by physicians, and for this reason the earliest attempts at artificial cooling were made by physicians.\n\nEARLY USES OF LOW TEMPERATURES\nVery early in his history man discovered fire, learned how to kindle it and how to use it for his good. That discovery placed him immediately on a level far above the beasts. However, it is only in comparatively recent times that he has learned the uses of low temperatures. Nature\u2019s stores of ice were drawn upon, and methods of preserving ice through warm weather were discovered in ancient times. Nero had ice houses built for him in Rome, but he could stock these buildings only with the ice that nature furnished him. Freezing mixtures of salt and ice, such as we use in our ice-cream freezers to-day to obtain temperatures far below the freezing point of water, were probably known in early times, but the ancients did not know how to produce ice.\n\nArtificial ice was probably first made in India, where it has long been the practice to produce ice by evaporation. Water is placed in shallow pans and then dry air is circulated over it, causing so rapid a vaporization as to cool the water to the freezing point. The idea of cooling water by evaporation belongs to very ancient times. Water placed in porous earthen vessels was found to be[350] cooler than water kept in water-tight jars. The moisture that escaped through the vessel would evaporate, and in so doing draw heat out of the vessel and its contents. To-day campers keep water cool by putting it in canvas buckets and hanging the buckets in the wind, so that the moisture oozing through the canvas will evaporate quickly.\n\nIt was not until 1755 that a mechanical means of producing low temperatures was developed. The inventor was Dr. Cullen, and he used an evaporation system, expediting the evaporation by producing a partial vacuum over the water. But nearly a century elapsed before the first commercially successful refrigerating machine was built. Even then the advantages of artificial refrigeration were not fully realized, and it was not until late in the last century that real progress was made. Since then the development of artificial refrigeration has been truly remarkable.\n\nHEAT AND MECHANICAL ENERGY\nThere is a definite relation between heat and mechanical energy, in fact the two are mutually convertible. The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a pound of water 1 degree F. is called a British thermal unit or a B. t. u. This measure is taken at 39.1 degrees F., because at that temperature water is at its densest. Since heat and mechanical energy are mutually convertible, we can express foot-pounds or horsepower in B. t. u. One B. t. u. is equivalent to 778 foot-pounds of energy. In other words, the amount of heat that would raise the temperature of a pound of water 1 degree F. would, if converted into mechanical[351] energy, be sufficient to raise a weight of 778 pounds to a height of one foot, or one pound to a height of 778 feet. A horsepower is equivalent to 2,545 B. t. u. per hour.\n\nHeat from burning coal is used to generate steam, and this in turn is used to operate a steam engine and thus heat is converted into mechanical energy (unfortunately most of the original heat units in the coal are wasted, as was pointed out in a previous chapter); but heat will not flow from one body into another of higher temperature without the expenditure of mechanical energy. It always flows from a hot body into a cold one, and not from the cold body into the hot one, unless it is actually pumped up to the higher heat level by some mechanical means. A refrigerating machine is actually a heat pump with which we produce a partial heat vacuum.\n\nWhenever a gas is compressed, heat is generated. Anyone who has operated a tire pump knows how hot the pump becomes from the heat that is seemingly squeezed out of the compressed air. As was noted in Chapter VIII, heat is liable to give trouble in an air compressor, and sometimes the temperature rises to such a point that there is an explosion of the air and the vapors coming from the oil used to lubricate the machine. The compressed air is therefore cooled by means of water jackets or coils of pipe through which water is passed. In this way the excess heat is carried off. When, however, cooled compressed air is relieved of pressure and allowed to expand again the process is reversed. A partial heat vacuum is formed and heat from surrounding objects flows into the vacuum. In other words, the surrounding objects are cooled.\n\n[352]\n\nCOLD AIR MACHINES\n\nFIG. 79.\u2014COLD AIR MACHINE\n\nIt is a simple matter to make a machine which will alternately compress, cool, and expand air in such a way as to produce a lowered temperature. Such a machine is indicated diagrammatically in Figure 79. There are two cylinders, A and B, and a condenser at C. When the piston a in cylinder A descends it compresses the air in the cylinder; this air flows into the condenser C. There is a coil of pipe in this condenser through which water circulates. This carries off the heat of compression and then a valve is opened which permits the cooler air to pass off into cylinder B. As the air expands in this cylinder it becomes chilled. This chilled air is then forced out of cylinder B by means of piston b and flows into the refrigerator or cold storage room D. As the air is liable to take up moisture and to introduce objectionable vapors from oil used to lubricate the pumps, it is usually confined in pipes in the refrigerator and then returned to the cylinder A.\n\n\nCOMPOSITOR AT WORK ON A LINOTYPE MACHINE\n\n\nTHE OPTOPHONE\n\nAn instrument which enables the blind to read common print\n\n\nA BLIND MAN READING WITH HIS EARS\n\n[353]\n\nThis is a type of a refrigerating machine that is used very extensively on ships for chilling perishable foods. However, air has only a very low capacity for heat, and in order to obtain an appreciable amount of refrigeration very large volumes of air must be handled. This means that cold-air machines must be very large and bulky. The efficiency of such machines is low, but they find favor on shipboard because there are no inflammable or poisonous gases to be dealt with. In the standard machine of the United States Navy air is compressed to 260 pounds; and in the expansion is raised to 60 pounds pressure, which is enough to reduce the temperature to between 70 to 90 degrees below zero.\n\nLATENT HEAT\nFar more efficient are the machines which utilize latent heat. As explained in a previous chapter, whenever a solid is converted into a liquid or into a gas a certain amount of heat is absorbed and stored up in such a way as not to become apparent to the senses or to a thermometer. Such heat is known as \u201clatent heat.\u201d For instance, we can add a pound of water at 50 degrees temperature to a pound of water at 200 degrees, and the mixture will have a temperature of 125 degrees, or the mean of 200 + 50 degrees. But a pound of ice at 32 degrees mixed with a pound of water at 200 degrees will not give us 116 degrees ((200+32)/2), but only 44\u00bd degrees. In other words, about 143 heat units will[354] be rendered latent in converting solid water into liquid water, reducing the temperature of the water to 57 degrees and then the mean of 57 and 32 is 44.5 (200-143=57, (57+32)/2 = 44\u00bd). A more striking experiment is to mix a pound of water cooled to 32 degrees F. with a pound of water at 175 degrees F., and the result will be two pounds of water at 103.5 degrees, but if we mix a pound of chopped ice at 32 degrees F. with a pound of water at 175 degrees F., the result will be two pounds of water cooled to the freezing point.\n\nIn passing from a liquid into a gas water absorbs far more heat and renders it latent. For each pound of water converted into steam at atmospheric pressure 970 B. t. u. are absorbed. This storage of latent heat is utilized to good advantage in refrigerating machinery. The vacuum machine invented by Dr. Cullen in 1755 was a latent heat machine.\n\nVACUUM MACHINES\nAs we have observed before, the boiling point of a liquid depends upon the pressure to which it is subjected. Under the normal atmospheric pressure of 14.7 pounds per inch the boiling point of water is 212 degrees F., but if the pressure be increased the boiling point rises, and if it be reduced the boiling point is lowered. In a partial vacuum of ten pounds absolute pressure the boiling point is 193.2 degrees, at one pound it is 102.1 degrees, and if the pressure is reduced to .089 pound water will boil at 32 degrees, or its normal freezing point. Dr. Cullen, by exhausting the air from a vessel containing water, made the water boil or vaporize at a low temperature. In order to boil it had to[355] absorb heat, and not being supplied with any external heat it had to draw upon itself, thus producing ice.\n\n\nFIG. 80.\u2014DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF A VACUUM REFRIGERATING MACHINE\n\nDr. Cullen\u2019s machine has been improved upon by using various chemical substances to absorb the water vapor. Such a machine is shown in Figure 80. The vacuum chamber A is partly filled with brine, which may be cooled below the freezing point of pure water without congealing. A pump, B, maintains a vacuum in the chamber. In the upper part of the vacuum chamber there is a vessel, C, into which sulphuric acid is sprayed from a reservoir, D. This acid has a strong affinity for water vapor and hastens the evaporation by absorbing the vapor with which it comes in contact. The mixed sulphuric acid and water flows over into a receiver, E. The acid is reconcentrated by steam heat so that it can be used over again. However, this feature of the process is not shown in the diagram.[356] Brine from the chamber A passes through a coil of pipe F in the tank G, where the ice is made, and it is returned to the vacuum chamber by an injector H, which at the same time introduces fresh water into the chamber to take the place of that absorbed by the acid. The fresh water and brine enter as a spray at I, so as to increase the rate of evaporation.\n\n\nFIG. 81.\u2014ORIGINAL ABSORPTION MACHINE\n\nTHE ABSORPTION PROCESS\nAnother form of refrigeration is known as the absorption system, and strangely enough direct heat is applied to the machine in one place in order to abstract heat from it in another. A diagrammatic representation of the first machine of this type (which was invented by Frederick Carr\u00e9) is shown in Figure 81. Two vessels, A and B, are employed,[357] which are connected by a tube C. The vessel A contains ammonia solution. A lamp, D, is placed under the vessel A. Sufficient heat is produced to vaporize the ammonia, whose boiling point is very low, and distill it out of the water in the solution. It passes through tube C into vessel B. This vessel is surrounded by a tank, E, containing cold water, which condenses the ammonia vapor into liquid ammonia, then the process is reversed.\n\nThe circulation of water through tank E is checked and water from pipe F is sprayed on vessel A. This cools the contents of vessel A, producing a partial vacuum. The ammonia in chamber B boils and its vapors pass back into chamber A, where they are reabsorbed by the water in that chamber. The rapid vaporization in chamber B absorbs heat from the immediate surroundings and will freeze water placed in the tank E.\n\nIn commercial practice the absorption system is very extensively employed. The ammonia is placed in a large cylinder known as a generator and is heated by steam coils. The ammonia vapor passes through an analyzer which traps any water vapor it may contain, and then it goes through a series of condensing coils, which are cooled by water. In these condensing coils the ammonia vapor is liquefied by the pressure in the generator and collects in a receiver, whence it passes through an expansion valve into the cooling coils in the brine tank. From the cooling coils the ammonia gas passes back through an absorber which reverses the operation of the generator. Here weak aqua ammonia is sprayed on the ammonia gas and absorbs it. The rich ammonia solution is then pumped into the generator.\n\n[358]\n\nThere are several auxiliary apparatus which are omitted in this brief description in the interest of clarity.\n\nTHE COMPRESSION SYSTEM\n\nFIG. 82.\u2014DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF A COMPRESSION MACHINE\n\nOne more type of refrigerating machine remains to be described and that is the compression type. This was invented by Jacob Perkins in 1834, but was not developed into a commercial machine until 1850. This machine is the most important of them all. In some respects it is like the absorption process, but in place of adding direct heat a compressing machine is employed. Figure 82 illustrates the system diagrammatically. At A is the compressor which compresses ammonia gas. The gas which is heated by the compressor is then cooled and liquefied in the condenser B. Thence it passes into a brine tank C, where it expands and absorbs heat. From this point it is drawn back into the compressor, thus completing the cycle. In other words, the ammonia must absorb as much heat from the brine as is taken out of it at the condenser.\n\n[359]\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\nENGINES OF DESTRUCTION\n\nAT THE VERY beginning of this book we observed that war is a most potent stimulus to invention among primitive men. Despite all our advances in civilization we still have our wars, each more dreadful than the preceding one; for each important conflict brings forth new engines of destruction or stimulates the invention of new death-dealing machines which are developed during intervals of peace. So terrible has modern war become that with each great conflict it has seemed as if its very dreadfulness would stay the hand of the invader and make him hesitate to expose his men to the horrible monsters which science and invention have created. To-day, after a titanic struggle which cost millions of human lives, which destroyed billions of dollars\u2019 worth of property, and which made itself felt to the remotest corners of the earth, serious efforts are being made to banish war, but at the same time inventors here and abroad are busy inventing new and more powerful engines of death, and the prospects are that the next big war, should there ever be one, will be even more horrible and destructive than the one we have just passed through.\n\nFortunately engines of death are not the only inventions produced by war. Many machines, apparatus, and processes are originated or developed which have a distinct value in time of peace; hence[360] war is a great constructive as well as a destructive agency. In this respect the great World War was no exception and we are already reaping benefits which in a small way compensate for the havoc that was wrought. It advanced scientific research to a point it would not have reached in fifty years of peace. The stimulus was felt in every field of science from chemistry to acoustics, from geology to meteorology. Wonderful progress was made in radiotelephony, in submarine navigation, in aviation, and there were scores of inventions which will add to our comfort and aid us in the mastery of Nature.\n\nMany of these inventions have already been described; others do not properly belong in this volume as they have to do chiefly with electricity or chemistry. In this chapter we shall take up mainly the machines built for the purpose of destroying men and their works.\n\nPRIMITIVE \u201cENGINES\u201d OF WAR\nOf course the main objects of war are offense and defense, the destruction of the opponent and the protection of one\u2019s self. This first fighting was a hand-to-hand struggle which gave way to fighting at a distance as spears and arrows were invented. Shields and armor were then invented to ward off these missiles. Cities were surrounded with walls to hold off the enemy. Then came the Roman war \u201cengines,\u201d catapults and battering rams, to destroy the walls and towers which would enable the besiegers to fight on an equal level and in personal contact with the besieged. Although a battle might start with long-distance fighting it was always a hand-to-hand encounter that clinched the victory. Even to-day, although we have our big guns which[361] fight at ranges of five to twenty miles, it is the rifle or bayonet which wins or loses the battle.\n\nINVENTION OF GUNPOWDER\nThe introduction of gunpowder from China in the fifteenth century did not immediately revolutionize warfare. It was used only in cannon or mortars for hurling large stones at city walls. The range of those cannon was so limited and the time it took to load and fire them was so great that they were of little use on an open battlefield. A cannon, although a comparatively powerful offensive weapon, was helpless against attack and was only suitable for use in forts or behind breastworks. Later when its range was increased and it came to be used on the battlefield it had to be protected from capture by men supplied with small arms.\n\nThis defect of the cannon also applied to the use of the hand gun. Its range was small and consequently the blunderbuss type was invented to spread the charge of shot as much as possible so as to tear a wide gap in the enemy\u2019s line and prevent it from closing in upon the operator of the gun. But the loading and firing of these early firearms was extremely slow and the battle-ax and even the arrow and the crossbow were much more effective weapons. So unreliable were the muskets of our Revolutionary War that in battle more dependence was placed upon the bayonet than the firearm.\n\nTHE SPINNING BULLET\nThree important improvements were necessary to make the small gun a really effective weapon. First was the invention of a reliable means of igniting the powder; second the rifling of the barrel so that[362] the bullet would not tumble but would hold a true course, and finally the invention of a cartridge and a rifle that could be loaded from the breech. These improvements were not completely effected until the time of the Civil War. Since then there have been further marked improvements: The power of cartridges has been increased; the bullets have been given a stream-line form so as to increase the range of the rifle and its power of penetration; the rifle has been equipped with a magazine for carrying a number of cartridges; and a simple mechanism has been provided for discharging empty shells and inserting fresh cartridges in a minimum of time.\n\nGyroscopic action plays a very important part in the flight of a bullet or shell. The spiral grooves cut in the bore of the rifle give the projectile a twist that sets it to spinning rapidly. The spinning bullet is virtually a gyroscope and maintains its axis in the line of flight. Hence it is possible to use a long pointed bullet instead of the round ball of earlier days and to give the projectile a shape that will enable it to cut through the air with comparatively little resistance. The same bullet fired from a smooth bore gun would begin to tumble and would encounter so much air resistance that it would fall short in the space of a few hundred feet, besides which it would wander far off its course.\n\nMACHINE GUNS\nA rifle is really a machine for hurling small projectiles. During the Civil War a Chicago physician named Gatling fell to pondering over the inefficiency of using a machine that would fire only one bullet at a time with a considerable interval of time between shots for reloading, and he hit upon the idea[363] of developing a machine that would discharge a continuous stream of bullets. So he built a ten-barrel revolving gun operated by a hand crank. The barrels were automatically loaded and fired one after the other. Although it was slow to accept the Gatling machine gun, the U. S. Army after once accepting it was loath to give it up even after better machine guns were invented.\n\nUTILIZING THE KICK OF A GUN\nIn the Gatling gun hand power was required to operate the loading, firing and shell-ejecting mechanism, but it occurred to another inventor that a small portion of the energy developed in exploding the cartridge could very well be utilized to replace the hand power and thus make the machine gun completely automatic. It was Hiram Maxim who first carried out this idea to a successful conclusion. When a rifle is fired the suddenly expanding gases push back against the breech of the gun with just as much pressure as they do against the bullet and this shows itself in the recoil or \u201ckick\u201d of the gun. Maxim utilized the kick of the gun to cock the gun, open the breech, eject the empty shell, take a fresh cartridge out of a magazine belt, insert it in the breech chamber, lock the breech and fire the gun. All these operations occupied but an instant of time and the gun kept on firing as long as the belt of cartridges held out.\n\nJohn M. Browning, inventor of the Colt gun, instead of using the recoil, employed a small portion of the gases to operate the mechanism. A minute hole in the barrel of the gun, near the muzzle, communicated with a small cylinder in which was a spring-pressed piston. The gases pursuing the[364] bullet out of the barrel would find this tiny hole and, entering it, push back the piston. The pressure against the piston would be only a small fraction of that exerted against the bullet and would last for only the briefest part of a second, from the time the bullet uncovered the hole to the time it emerged from the barrel and liberated the gases, but this minute portion of the energy of the powder was sufficient to actuate the mechanism which performed all the operations necessary to reload and fire the gun.\n\nCOOLING THE GUN BARREL\nThe advantage of these machine guns over Gatling\u2019s lay not only in the saving of human labor, but in the fact that a single barrel was employed in place of ten, thereby greatly reducing the weight of the gun. But a serious handicap was encountered in the heat developed by the burning powder. Dr. Gatling, by using ten barrels, could let nine be cooling while the tenth was discharging, but even he found it necessary to place a water jacket about half the length of the barrels. In the Maxim machine gun a large water jacket enveloped the whole length of the barrel and when the gun was firing continuously at a moderate rate the 7\u00bd pints of water contained in the water jacket would come to a boil inside of a minute and a half, and thereafter more than a pint would be evaporated each minute of firing, or about a pint and a half per thousand rounds. The necessity of using water-cooling added considerably to the weight of the gun and made it occupy in the service an intermediate place between the shoulder rifle and the big gun.\n\nAnother method of cooling was to use a barrel with a large outer diameter and depend upon the[365] radiation of heat from the outer surface to prevent overheating. This was later improved by putting flanges on the outer surface of the barrel, so as to increase the radiating surface, in the same way that the cylinders of a motorcycle are kept cool. The barrel was made easily detachable and a spare one provided, so that as soon as the barrel grew excessively hot it could be removed and replaced with a cool barrel. The fault of overheating is not that it might explode the cartridge prematurely but that the bore will be enlarged by heat expansion so that the bullets will not take the rifling and will come out of the barrel as if from a smooth-bore gun. In a test of a Hotchkiss machine gun which was fired continuously the expansion was sufficient at the end of four minutes to make the course of the bullets very uncertain and in seven minutes the bullets, emerging without any spin, tumbled over and over and failed to carry more than three hundred yards.\n\nA GUN THAT FANS ITSELF\nThe next marked step in the development of the machine gun was to make it fan itself and thus keep its barrel cool. Col. I. N. Lewis designed a gun operated by gas pressure somewhat on the principle of the Colt gun and around the barrel he fitted sixteen deep flanges or fins of aluminum that ran lengthwise of the gun. Around these fins he fitted a casing, thus forming 16 long narrow chambers about the barrel. The casing was open at the breech end, but at the outer end was contracted into a narrow mouthpiece that extended beyond the muzzle. The mouthpiece was so formed that as the bullets passed through it they sucked air through the chambers, thereby cooling the gun. The air travels[366] through the casing at the rate of about seventy miles per hour.\n\nThis design permitted Col. Lewis to build a very light gun. Its total weight was but 25\u00bd pounds and it could be handled by a single man if the muzzle was supported on some sort of a rest. It represented a marked step toward a shoulder machine gun which would increase enormously the efficiency of infantry equipped with this weapon. The difference between rifle fire and machine-gun fire has been likened to the difference between trying to hit a tin can with a stone and with a stream of water from a hose. In the latter case the hose may be raised or lowered to correct the course of the stream and bring it to bear on the target. In the same way by watching the effect of the machine-gun bullets the leaden stream may be corrected to bring it directly upon the target. The advantages of a weapon such as this, which may be fired from the shoulder or from the hip, are perfectly obvious.\n\nAs the war was nearing its end John M. Browning produced two machine guns, one a water-cooled heavy model fired from a stand. The total weight of this gun was 34\u00bd pounds and with the water jacket empty it weighed but 22\u00bd pounds. It was operated by the recoil of the gun, but the mechanism was greatly simplified and there were but few parts. These could be taken apart and replaced with new ones in a minimum of time in case of breakage. The other gun was a shoulder rifle weighing only 16 pounds, which carried a clip of twenty cartridges. These could be fired singly or in rapid succession in the space of two and a half seconds. Only a second was required to replace the empty clip with a filled one. No special cooling apparatus was provided[367] because it was not likely that a shoulder rifle would be fired long enough at a time to become excessively heated.\n\nPOCKET-SIZED MACHINE GUN\nThe latest development in machine guns is a pocket edition weapon\u2014a firearm weighing only 7 pounds and measuring but 22 inches over all. This little gun which is too small to be classed as a rifle and yet rather large for a pistol, has two grips so that it may be fired from the waist line, and it may be fitted with a gun butt so that it may be fired from the shoulder. It operates at the astounding rate of 1,500 shots per minute or three times the speed of the average machine gun. The cartridges are fed either from a box magazine containing 20 rounds or from a drum-shaped magazine loaded with 50 to 100 cartridges. The operating mechanism of this gun is entirely different from anything produced heretofore and depends upon a discovery made by Commander Blish of the United States Navy. He found that a wedge of a certain angle will hold a breechblock closed against the pressure of an exploding cartridge while the pressure is high, but will slide when the pressure falls. Apparently at first the adhesion due to friction is too great to permit the wedge to move, but the adhesion falls off more rapidly than the pressure does and a point is reached at which the wedge yields to the pressure. In the \u201csubmachine\u201d gun, as the new weapon is called, the barrel (or rather an extension of the barrel) and the receiver, in which the operating mechanism is contained, are locked together by a wedge. The wedge slides in slots set at an angle of 80 degrees with the axis of the barrel. When a cartridge[368] is fired the wedge remains fast while the bullet is traveling through the bore, but when it emerges and the pressure of the gases falls off the wedge slides, unlocking the breech mechanism. The gun is remarkable for its simplicity and the fewness of its parts. It has been adopted by the Police Department of New York City.\n\nARTILLERY VS. ARMOR\nAs has been stated above, gunpowder was first introduced in warfare not for the purpose of destroying men, but for smashing city walls and fortifications, so that infantry could pour through the breeches made by the heavy stone or iron projectiles. As artillery grew more powerful and the aim more accurate walls of masonry gave way to earthworks and to masses of concrete and armored steel. However the World War demonstrated the impossibility of building any fortifications above ground that would stand up against modern high-powered guns.\n\nGUNS, MORTARS, AND HOWITZERS\nIn military parlance a \u201cgun\u201d is a long-barreled piece that fires its projectiles with a flat trajectory, that is, the projectile is fired at a low angle and describes a long flat curve. A \u201cmortar\u201d is a short-ranged weapon which fires at a high angle so as to land its projectile over the walls of a fortification. The barrel of the mortar was formerly very short and had a smooth bore, but later the barrel was extended and the bore rifled so as to give a greater range, developing what is known as the \u201chowitzer.\u201d The famous 42-centimeter gun with which the Germans started the war was a howitzer which fired a shell a yard and a half long weighing 2,108 pounds.[369] We have big guns to defend our coasts which fire a shell 16 inches in diameter, which is half an inch less than 42 centimeters, and the weight of the shell is 2,400 pounds. But the startling thing about the German big howitzers was that they were portable and could be brought up to smash fixed defenses. As the war proceeded enormous guns as well as howitzers were set on railroad mounts and moved about from time to time to avoid discovery by spying aviators.\n\nTHE 76-MILE GUN\nThe 76-mile gun which bombarded Paris fired projectiles of only 8.27-inch caliber. The projectile described a wide curve which carried it about twenty-four miles above the surface of the earth or about 3\u00bd times as high as the greatest altitude ever reached by man in an aeroplane. Had it pursued a perfectly straight line from the forest of St. Gobain to Paris its course would have carried it 3,750 feet below the surface, because of the curvature of the earth. The range of the projectile was very materially increased by rising to such a great elevation because of the extreme tenuity of the atmosphere. The air resistance that a shell is obliged to overcome is not generally appreciated. In the denser strata of the lower atmosphere the resistance is very great, but as a shell mounts to higher levels the air resistance falls off considerably and at twenty miles it is practically nonexistent.\n\nIt was not until the summer after the armistice that details of this gun were disclosed. There were seven of these powerful guns that participated in the various bombardments. They wore out very quickly under the terrific strain to which they were subjected and were rebored to a diameter of 9.4[370] inches. In the last bombardment a number of shells of this size reached Paris. The guns were fired at an angle of 55 degrees from the horizontal so as to pass quickly through the denser layers of the air. The shell left the muzzle of the gun with the velocity of about 5,000 feet per second and arrived in Paris about three minutes later with a velocity of about half that amount. The enormous muzzle velocity was obtained by using a very long gun so that the powder could keep pushing the projectile for a comparatively long time. The guns were built out of worn-out 15-inch naval guns. These guns which were 56 feet long were rebored, fitted with a heavy tube and pieced out to a length of 118 feet. The last 20 feet of the bore was not rifled and served as a guide to keep the shell in perfect axial alignment when it emerged from the muzzle. A comparatively slow powder was used so as not to put too severe a strain on the gun at the breech, but gradually to accelerate the shell in its travel through the bore.\n\nSpectacular as was the performance of these huge guns, they were of little military value. The slightest variation in the powder would cause a wide variation of range and they could not hope to hit a target smaller than a large city. All seven guns fired a total of 303 shells in 44 days of bombardment, only 183 of which fell within the city. They killed 256 persons and wounded 620. Far more damage at far less expense could have been effected by dropping bombs from aircraft.\n\nA 121-MILE GUN\nJust as a problem in ordnance, American officers designed a gun 225 feet long which would fire a 400-pound shell of 10-inch caliber. It was estimated that with a charge of 1,440 pounds of[371] powder the shell would leave the muzzle with a velocity of 8,500 feet per second and, if fired at an angle of 55 degrees, would have a range of 121 miles. The shell would rise to a height of 46 miles above the earth and would make the 121 miles in about 4 minutes. The gun was never built, because its military value would in no way be commensurate with its cost of construction and operation. The purpose of the German long-range bombardment was to produce a moral rather than a military effect. The Germans hoped to intimidate the French people by this spectacular performance, and in this they failed completely.\n\nTIMED AND PERCUSSION SHELLS\nIn modern warfare large guns are used either to rain a storm of death upon infantry or to destroy their defensive works. In earlier days the effectiveness of gunfire against a charging enemy was increased by the use of grapeshot. A cannon was thus converted into a gigantic shotgun. But although a wide dispersion of projectiles was obtained the range was very limited. This handicap was then overcome by having the gun fire another gun which would discharge when it had reached the enemy\u2019s lines. In other words, the grapeshot or leaden balls were packed into a shell which was fired like a solid projectile, and this exploded when it struck the target, scattering death broadcast. An improvement on this was the timed shell, which would explode while still in the air and scatter its rain of lead over a wide area. The time fuse of a shrapnel shell must be very delicately adjusted to explode at the desired instant. A train of powder is used which may be short-circuited to give the[372] exact length required for any given distance. The powder is ignited by a cap which is exploded by concussion when the gun is fired. The fuse then burns until it reaches the main charge of the shell. This explodes, bursting the shell open and scattering shell fragments as well as the scores of lead balls with which the shell is packed. Should the fuse fail, a detonating pin is provided which will explode the shell when it reaches the ground. Where the object is to destroy defensive works the shell is charged with a high explosive which is detonated not by a time fuse, but by concussion when the shell strikes its target.\n\nThe war brought forth many new types of projectiles: shells loaded with lethal gases; shells which left a trail of smoke whereby their course could be followed when fired at aircraft; shells that illuminated the battlefield at night, etc. The searchlight shells carried a number of \u201ccandles,\u201d each furnished with a little parachute so that when the shell exploded the burning candles would settle slowly to the ground, all the while casting a brilliant light on operations below.\n\nAERIAL BOMBS\nObviously, hurling projectiles from the air is a much simpler matter than projecting them from the ground. No propellant is required to carry them to the target and no rifling is necessary to keep them head-on in the direction of flight. They are pulled instead of being pushed and can easily be kept in their course by means of rudder planes. But hitting a target from an aeroplane is like hitting a swiftly moving object from the ground. The target is seemingly flying past the aeroplane and in calculating where the aerial bomb will strike the[373] speed of the plane through the air and its height above the ground must all be taken into consideration.\n\nNaval warfare is a fight of fort against fort and consequently the high explosive projectile is the principal one used. The shells must be able to penetrate heavy steel armor and explode within the hull of the vessel. In addition to these we have the torpedoes fired by destroyers and submarines which explode an enormous quantity of high explosive against the hull of the vessel. No attempt is made to penetrate the skin of the vessel, but the explosive, tamped by a considerable depth of water, delivers a very heavy crushing blow against the side of the hull.\n\nAUTOMATIC CONTROL OF SUBMARINE TORPEDOES\nIt is wrong to speak of firing a torpedo. A torpedo is really an automatic, self-propelled, submarine boat. All that the destroyer or submarine does is to set the steering gear in this little boat and then launch it at the enemy with a blast of air that ejects it from the torpedo tube. Most of the body of the torpedo is filled with compressed air which drives a small air motor coupled to a pair of propellers. These propellers run in opposite directions so as to balance each other and they drive the torpedo through the water at a speed of about forty miles per hour. The speed falls off gradually as the air supply is exhausted.\n\nTo hold the torpedo on its course horizontal and vertical rudders are employed. The vertical rudder is controlled by a gyroscope which turns it this way or that according as the torpedo tends to veer off its course.\n\n[374]\n\nThe value of a torpedo lies in its concealment. Were it to travel on the surface the vessel against which it was directed might be able to avoid it; furthermore the action of the waves would tend to disturb the gyroscopic steering mechanism and the torpedo would pursue an erratic course. For this reason it must travel under water at a depth sufficient to avoid surface disturbances. There is also a distinct advantage in having a good cover of water over the torpedo when it strikes its target because the force of the explosion, although felt in all directions, is mainly expended along the line of the least resistance. If the depth of water over the torpedo is slight, most of the force will be expended upward and only a comparatively small part will act against the hull of the vessel. It was the practice of the Germans to set their torpedoes for a depth of about ten feet.\n\nTo hold a torpedo at a fixed depth a very delicate hydrostatic valve is employed which operates the diving rudders. The valve is set for a certain depth or weight of water. If the torpedo goes below this depth, the weight of the water bearing on this valve presses it down and thereby tilts the diving rudders until the torpedo comes back to the required depth. If it rises above the depth for which it is set, the valve feels the reduction of water pressure and tilts the rudders in the opposite direction to correct the deviation from the predetermined line of travel. Once the valve has been set the torpedo takes care of itself automatically. It may be discharged from any depth or be dropped from torpedo tubes on the deck of a ship and after a few undulations it will find its depth and hold it as long as it keeps running.\n\n[375]\n\nTorpedoes have actually been discharged from aeroplanes and it is possible that in the next great war swiftly flying aeroplanes may actually bring death and destruction to powerful dreadnoughts. In fact winged destroyers and battle cruisers of the air may render obsolete all our modern fighting machines.\n\nAs we have already observed, it was war that first aroused the inventive instincts in man. Fortunately this instinct was not confined to destructive devices and engines, and the mechanical conquest of the earth, although it continues to derive much benefit from the stimulus of war, may well afford to break off relations with so grim and horrible a partner and proceed to develop under the stimulus of its own successes.\n\n[376]\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\nSUMMARY OF MECHANICAL PROGRESS\n\nTHE REAL beginning of the present age of machinery dates from Watt\u2019s invention of the double-acting steam engine which was patented in 1782. Prior to that date the steam engine was used merely for pumping water, but now in its new form it was adapted for use in driving industrial machinery. But, as we have shown in another chapter, it was not until John Wilkinson invented his boring machine in 1774 that it was possible to bore the cylinders that Watt used in his engine.\n\nIn the field of machine tools there were several notable inventions. Henry Maudslay invented the slide rest for lathes and later in 1797 the screwcutting lathe. Joseph Bramah invented the hydraulic press and Maudslay furnished the cup leather packing that made it a success. Woodworking machinery, and particularly mortising machines for making pulley blocks, were invented by Samuel Bentham and patented in 1791 and 1793.\n\nIn the textile industry we find the spinning jenny invented by Hargreaves in 1770, Richard Arkwright\u2019s roll-drawing spinning machine invented in 1769 and 1775, and Crompton\u2019s mule spinner invented between 1774 and 1779, but never patented. In addition to this there was the invention of the cotton gin in 1794 by our own Eli Whitney and Dr. Cartwright\u2019s series of patents on the power-driven[377] loom granted between 1785 and 1788. In 1799 Louis Roberts invented a machine that would make a continuous web of paper. The machine was developed in England by the Fourdrinier Brothers and has ever since borne their name.\n\n1801-1810\nJust before the Nineteenth Century dawned the patents on Watt\u2019s steam engine expired and the invention became public property.\n\nTrevithic applied steam power to the propulsion of a coach in 1801. This was the forerunner of the automobile and it led to the invention of the first steam railway and locomotive three years later. Steam was also applied to the propulsion of boats in this decade and reached the practical stage when Fulton built the Clermont in 1807. The first application of steam to the driving of a loom is accredited to William Horrocks in 1803. Jacquard\u2019s loom attachment for producing various patterns was invented in 1801. The first knitting machine in which the latch needle was used was patented in France in 1806 by Jeandeau.\n\nAmong the machine-tool developments the most important were Bramah\u2019s invention of the planer in 1802 and Brunel\u2019s mortising machine in 1801. A process of making malleable iron castings was invented by Lucas in 1804. The percussion lock for guns was invented by Forsyth in 1807.\n\n1811-1820\nThe second decade saw a much wider application of steam and considerable development in locomotives. Hedley\u2019s \u201cPuffing Billy\u201d was built in 1813, and Stephenson\u2019s first locomotive in 1814.\n\n[378]\n\nIn the same year Fulton built the first steam war vessel and five years later the Atlantic was crossed for the first time by a steamer, the Savannah. The rotary steam printing press belongs to this decade.\n\nThe circular knitting machine was invented by Brunel in 1816. About 1818 Eli Whitney invented the milling machine, and in 1819 Blanchard invented his \u201cgun-stocking\u201d lathe with which irregular forms could be turned out. The breech-loading musket was patented in this country by Thornton and Hall in 1811.\n\n1821-1830\nIn this decade we find the conversion of electricity into mechanical motion and many other important electrical developments, which, however, are omitted from this list as we are confining ourselves to mechanical inventions. There were marked developments in steam railroads. Stephenson built the \u201cRocket\u201d which won prizes on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and the first locomotive was imported into this country in 1829. The tubular locomotive boiler was invented by Seguin in 1828 and Ericsson\u2019s portable steam fire engine was built in 1830. In the previous year an important improvement in spinning mules was made when John Thorpe invented the ring frame.\n\n1831-1840\nImportant railroad developments mark the opening of this decade. The famous locomotive \u201cJohn Bull\u201d was imported from England in 1831 to operate on the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The following year saw the first American-built locomotive, \u201cOld Ironsides,\u201d which was built at Philadelphia by[379] the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Stephenson\u2019s link motion, also claimed by W. T. James, was invented in 1832.\n\nHowever, the most important development of the decade was the invention of the reaper. Hussey\u2019s patent was obtained in 1833 and McCormick\u2019s the following year.\n\nColt\u2019s revolver (1836); Perkin\u2019s portable ice machine (1834); Anthony\u2019s (1831), Tolle\u2019s (1834), and Burden\u2019s (1835) developments in machines for making horseshoes; and Isaac Babbit\u2019s antifriction-bearing metal are other notable developments.\n\n1841-1850\nIt was in 1841 that F. E. Sickels invented the drop cut-off valve gear, and the Corliss valve gear was patented in 1849 and 1851. Nasmyth\u2019s steam hammer was invented in 1842.\n\nHoe\u2019s revolving printing press was invented in 1845. The next year Sloan patented the gimlet-pointed screw. In 1847 Savage invented the time lock, and in 1849 Hibbert patented the latch needle for knitting machines. American machine-made watches appeared in 1850. However, the most important invention of the decade was Howe\u2019s sewing machine in 1845.\n\n1851-1860\nThe year 1851 saw an important improvement in the harvester when Seymour invented his self-raker, also an advance in firearms when Maynard invented the breech-loading rifle. Three years later Smith & Wesson came forth with their magazine rifle which was the forerunner of the \u201cWinchester.\u201d In that year Wilson invented the four-motion feed for sewing machines.\n\n[380]\n\nOne of the most notable inventions of the decade was Bessemer\u2019s converter for producing steel (1855), and the following year Siemens produced the regenerative furnace.\n\nGifford\u2019s injector (1858) marked a most important advance in steam engineering. The hand-turned turret for lathes was invented by Stephen Fitch about 1853, and the automatically revolving turret was brought out in 1855.\n\nOther inventions of the decade were Herman\u2019s diamond drill (1854), Ericsson\u2019s air engine (1855), the pedal-operated bicycle by Ernest Michaux (1855), use of wood pulp in the manufacture of paper by Voelter (1858), and the ammonia absorption ice machine invented by Carr\u00e9.\n\n1861-1870\nThe Civil War directed attention of inventors to military and naval improvements. Dr. Gatling invented his machine gun in 1862, the same year that Ericsson built the \u201cMonitor.\u201d It is interesting to note that the revolving turret was patented in that year by Theodore R. Timby. Dynamite was invented in 1867, and the Whitehead torpedo in the same year. Barbed wire was invented in 1861. The same year saw the first passenger elevator invented by Otis; the shoe-sewing machine invented by McKay, and Col. Green\u2019s invention of the drive well, which was brought about by the necessity of supplying his troops with water.\n\nThe pneumatic rock drill was invented by Burleigh in 1866, and Westinghouse invented the air brake in 1869. The latter, with Sholes\u2019s invention of the typewriter in the previous year, were undoubtedly the most notable inventions of the decade.\n\n[381]\n\nIn 1865 the cylindrical grinder marked a decided forward step in machine tools.\n\n1871-1880\nThis decade was marked by great activity, particularly in the field of electricity. While we are confining ourselves to mechanical inventions we cannot but mention Bell\u2019s telephone (1876), Edison\u2019s carbon filament lamp (1878), and Berliner\u2019s transmitter and Edison\u2019s carbon microphone which belong to the decade, although their patents were not issued until 1891 and 1892 respectively.\n\nThe web printing press was invented by Hoe in 1871. Ingersoll\u2019s compressed air rock drill appeared in the same year. A marked improvement in the Westinghouse air brake was patented in 1872, and the automatic car coupler appeared in 1873. The positive motion loom was invented by Lyall in 1872.\n\nThe harvester was improved by Gorham\u2019s twine binder in 1874, and in the same year a machine for making barbed wire was produced.\n\nThe Centennial year saw an important development in milling processes when the roller mill was introduced to take the place of the time-honored millstones. The middlings purifier was invented by George T. Smith in 1875. The hydraulic dredge was invented in 1876, also the universal grinder, and a machine for making cigarettes.\n\nEdison\u2019s invention of the phonograph and Otto\u2019s invention of the gas engine give prominence to the year 1877 and the Remington typewriter to the year 1878.\n\n1881-1890\nThe inventions of most far-reaching importance in this decade were Mergenthaler\u2019s linotype machine,[382] which was invented in 1884 and further developed into a practical machine in 1890; Gottlieb Daimler\u2019s invention of the automobile in 1883, and J. B. Dunlop\u2019s invention of the pneumatic tire in 1890.\n\nBerliner in 1887 invented the flat-disk talking machine known as the \u201cGramophone.\u201d The snapshot \u201cKodak\u201d camera appeared in 1888. In this year De Laval invented his steam turbine, while Harvey invented his process for annealing armor plate.\n\nThe following year nickel steel was invented. In 1883 Sir Hiram Maxim invented the machine gun. Hugo Bilgram\u2019s generating system of gear cutting was invented in 1881.\n\nA less prominent, though very important, invention of the same year was the buttonhole machine patented by Reece.\n\nIncidentally this decade saw the completion of the Brooklyn Suspension Bridge in 1883, and the Great Forth Bridge in 1890.\n\n1891-1900\nThe last decade of the Nineteenth Century gave us Parson\u2019s steam turbine (1891) and Curtis\u2019s steam turbine (1896); also Rudolf Diesel\u2019s heavy-oil engine.\n\nLangley\u2019s model for a motor-driven airplane was built in 1896 and actually flew. Santos-Dumont made his first ascension in a dirigible in 1898, and Count Friedrich von Zeppelin built his first rigid dirigible in 1900.\n\nJ. B. Holland built a steam-driven submarine, and Simon Lake constructed the first submarine to be driven by an internal combustion engine.\n\n[383]\n\nThis decade was largely devoted to the development of the automobile, which gradually evolved into a truly commercial machine. About 1900, Benjamin Holt invented the \u201ccaterpillar\u201d tractor. The decade also saw the invention of the Lanston \u201cmonotype,\u201d and Henry Wise Wood\u2019s \u201cautoplate\u201d machine which revolutionized stereotyping.\n\nIn 1899 William Draper brought out a loom with an automatic shuttle-changing mechanism. Hulett invented the automatic ore unloader in 1898. Improvements were also made in automatic machine tools. J. E. Gleason improved the Bilgram gear cutter in 1898, and at the close of the century Taylor and White brought out their high-speed cutting tools which revolutionized machine tools.\n\nThe decade was also remarkable for the invention of X-rays, wireless telegraphy, and certain chemical processes, none of which really belong in this summary.\n\n1901-1910\nIn this decade the automobile reached a marvelous state of perfection and a tremendous industry was built up which had a marked influence on the development of machine tools and the production of iron and steel. James A. Gailey invented a dryblast process for steel production, getting rid of the moisture in air by subjecting it to a freezing process. Fellow\u2019s gear-cutting machine was perfected and Bullard brought out the vertical turret lathe. There were important developments of the steam turbine.\n\nThere is one invention that makes this decade stand out from among all others. On December 17, 1903, the Wright brothers made a successful flight in a biplane driven by a gasoline engine, and opened up a new world for conquest. Man took[384] to wings and the dream of ages was realized. During the decade rapid progress was made in developing the flying machine. The invention of the monoplane soon followed.\n\nIt was in this decade that the gyroscope emerged from the laboratory and toy shop and began to be applied to practical uses. Schlick utilized the gyroscope to prevent ships from rolling. The gyrocompass was invented and reached a commercial stage in 1910.\n\n1911-1920\nIt is difficult to pick out the most important inventions of this decade because sufficient time has not elapsed to determine which are most deserving of mention. The Great World War stimulated invention in all civilized lands. Aeronautics developed faster in the five years of war than it could in twenty-five years of peace. Of course, engines of war developed to a remarkable degree. Among the lighter pieces we saw the development of the Lewis gun, and then the Browning gun. The most important invention was the tank. Many advances should be classed as remarkable developments rather than basically new inventions. The war of and against the submarine brought forth many ingenious devices.\n\nOf the peace-time inventions, the most remarkable is the optophone, the instrument which enables the blind to read ordinary printed matter.\n\nAnd thus the march of progress continues unchecked. We are tempted to give our imaginations free play and forecast the developments that the future holds in store for us, but unfortunately we cannot claim any prophetic instinct or inspiration.\n\n\nTitle: Experimental Mechanics\n\nAuthor: Robert S.

The audience was a large evening class consisting chiefly of artisans.\n\nThe teacher of Elementary Mechanics, whether he be in a Board School, a Technical School, a Public School, a Science College, or a University, frequently desires to enforce his lessons by exhibiting working apparatus to his pupils, and by making careful measurements in their presence.\n\nHe wants for this purpose apparatus of substantial proportions visible from every part of his lecture room. He wants to have it of such a universal character that he can produce from it day after day combinations of an ever-varying type. He wishes it to be composed of well-designed and well-made parts that shall be strong and durable, and [Pg viii]that will not easily get out of order. He wishes those parts to be such that even persons not specially trained in manual skill shall presently learn how to combine them with good effect. Lastly, he desires to economize his money in the matters of varnish, mahogany, and glass cases.\n\nI found that I was able to satisfy all these requirements by a suitable adaptation of the very ingenious system of mechanical apparatus devised by the late Professor Willis of Cambridge. The elements of the system I have briefly described in an Appendix, and what adaptations I have made of it are shown in almost every page and every figure of the book.\n\nIn revising the present edition I have been aided by my friends Mr. G. L. Cathcart, the Rev. M. H. Close, and Mr. E. P. Culverwell.\n\nRobert S. Ball.\n\nObservatory, Co.

I shall endeavour in this course of lectures to illustrate the elementary laws of mechanics by means of experiments. In order to understand the subject treated in this manner, you need not possess any mathematical knowledge beyond an acquaintance with the rudiments of algebra and with a few geometrical terms and principles. But even to those who, having an acquaintance with mathematics, have by its means acquired a knowledge of mechanics, experimental illustrations may still be useful. By actually seeing the truth of results with which you are theoretically familiar, clearer conceptions may be produced, and perhaps new lines of thought opened up. Besides, many of the mechanical principles which lie rather beyond the scope of elementary works on the [Pg 2]subject are very susceptible of being treated experimentally; and to the consideration of these some of the lectures of this course will be devoted.\n\nMany of our illustrations will be designedly drawn from very commonplace sources: by this means I would try to impress upon you that mechanics is not a science that exists in books merely, but that it is a study of those principles which are constantly in action about us. Our own bodies, our houses, our vehicles, all the implements and tools which are in daily use\u2014in fact all objects, natural and artificial, contain illustrations of mechanical principles. You should acquire the habit of carefully studying the various mechanical contrivances which may chance to come before your notice. Examine the action of a crane raising weights, of a canal boat descending through a lock. Notice the way a roof is made, or how it is that a bridge can sustain its load. Even a well-constructed farm-gate, with its posts and hinges, will give you admirable illustrations of the mechanical principles of framework. Take some opportunity of examining the parts of a clock, of a sewing-machine, and of a lock and key; visit a saw-mill, and ascertain the action of all the machines you see there; try to familiarize yourself with the principles of the tools which are to be found in any workshop. A vast deal of interesting and useful knowledge is to be acquired in this way.\n\nTHE DEFINITION OF FORCE.\n2. It is necessary to know the answer to this question, What is a force? People who have not studied mechanics occasionally reply, A push is a force, a steam-engine is a force, a horse pulling a cart is a force, gravitation is a force, a movement is a force, &c., &c. The true definition of force is that which tends to produce or to destroy motion. You may probably not fully understand this until some further [Pg 3]explanations and illustrations shall have been given; but, at all events, put any other notion of force out of your mind. Whenever I use the word Force, do you think of the words \u201csomething which tends to produce or to destroy motion,\u201d and I trust before the close of the lecture you will understand how admirably the definition conveys what force really is.\n\n3. When a string is attached to this small weight, I can, by pulling the string, move the weight along the table. In this case, there is something transmitted from my hand along the string to the weight in consequence of which the weight moves: that something is a force. I can also move the weight by pushing it with a stick, because force is transmitted along the stick, and makes itself known by producing motion. The archer who has bent his bow and holds the arrow between his finger and thumb feels the string pulling until the impatient arrow darts off. Here motion has been produced by the force of elasticity in the bent bow. Before he released the arrow there was no motion, yet still the bow was exerting force and tending to produce motion. Hence in defining force we must say \u201cthat which tends to produce motion,\u201d whether motion shall actually result or not.\n\n4. But forces may also be recognized by their capability or tendency to prevent or to destroy motion. Before I release the arrow I am conscious of exerting a force upon it in order to counteract the pull of the string. Here my force is merely manifested by destroying the motion that, if it were absent, the bow would produce. So when I hold a weight in my hand, the force exerted by my hand destroys the motion that the weight would acquire were I to let it fall; and if a weight greater than I could support were placed in my hand, my efforts to sustain it [Pg 4]would still be properly called force, because they tended to destroy motion, though unsuccessfully. We see by these simple cases that a force may be recognized either by producing motion or by trying to produce it, by destroying motion or by tending to destroy it; and hence the propriety of the definition of force must be admitted.\n\nTHE MEASUREMENT OF FORCE.\n5. As forces differ in magnitude, it becomes necessary to establish some convenient means of expressing their measurements. The pressure exerted by one pound weight at London is the standard with which we shall compare other forces. The piece of iron or other substance which is attracted to the earth with this force in London, is attracted to the earth with a greater force at the pole and a less force at the equator; hence, in order to define the standard force, we have to mention the locality in which the pressure of the weight is exerted.\n\nIt is easy to conceive how the magnitude of a pushing or a pulling force may be described as equivalent to so many pounds. The force which the muscles of a man\u2019s arm can exert is measured by the weight which he can lift. If a weight be suspended from an india-rubber spring, it is evident the spring will stretch so that the weight pulls the spring and the spring pulls the weight; hence the number of pounds in the weight is the measure of the force the spring is exerting. In every case the magnitude of a force can be described by the number of pounds expressing the weight to which it is equivalent. There is another but much more difficult mode of measuring force occasionally used in the higher branches of mechanics (Art. 497), but the simpler method is preferable for our present purpose.[Pg 5]\n\n\nFig. 1.\n\n6. The straight line in which a force tends to move the body to which it is applied is called the direction of the force. Let us suppose, for example, that a force of 3 lbs. is applied at the point a, Fig. 1, tending to make a move in the direction ab. A standard line c of certain length is to be taken. It is supposed that a line of this length represents a force of 1 lb. The line ab is to be measured, equal to three times c in length, and an arrow-head is to be placed upon it to show the direction in which the force acts. Hence, by means of a line of certain length and direction, and having an arrow-head attached, we are able completely to represent a force.\n\nEQUILIBRIUM OF TWO FORCES.\n\nFig. 2.\n\n7. In Fig. 2 we have represented two equal weights to which strings are attached; these strings, after passing over pulleys, are fastened by a knot c. The knot is pulled by equal and opposite forces. I mark off parts cd, ce, to indicate the forces; and since there is no reason why c should move to one side more than the other, it remains at rest. Hence, we learn that two equal and directly opposed forces counteract each other, and each may be regarded [Pg 6]as destroying the motion which the other is striving to produce. If I make the weights unequal by adding to one of them, the knot is no longer at rest; it instantly begins to move in the direction of the larger force.\n\n8. When two equal and opposite forces act at a point, they are said to be in equilibrium. More generally this word is used with reference to any set of forces which counteract each other. When a force acts upon a body, at least one more force must be present in order that the body should remain at rest. If two forces acting on a point be not opposite, they will not be in equilibrium; this is easily shown by pulling the knot c in Fig. 2 downwards. When released, it flies back again. This proves that if two forces be in equilibrium their directions must be opposite, for otherwise they will produce motion. We have already seen that the two forces must be equal.\n\nA book lying on the table is at rest. This book is acted upon by two forces which, being equal and opposite, destroy each other. One of these forces is the gravitation of the earth, which tends to draw the book downwards, and which would, in fact, make the book fall if it were not sustained by an opposite force. The pressure of the book on the table is often called the action, while the resistance offered by the table is the force of reaction. We here see an illustration of an important principle in nature, which says that action and reaction are equal and opposite.\n\nEQUILIBRIUM OF THREE FORCES.\n\nFig. 3.\n\n9. We now come to the important case where three forces act on a point: this is to be studied by the apparatus represented in Fig. 3. [Pg 7]It consists essentially of two pulleys h, h, each about 2\" diameter,[1] which are capable of turning very freely on their axles; the distance between these pulleys is about 5', and they are supported at a height of 6' by a frame, which will easily be understood from the figure. Over these pulleys passes a fine cord, 9' or 10' long, having a light hook at each of the ends e, f. To the centre of this cord d a short piece is attached, which at its [Pg 8]free end g is also furnished with a hook. A number of iron weights, 0\u00b75 lb., 1 lb., 2 lbs., &c., with rings at the top, are used; one or more of these can easily be suspended from the hooks as occasion may require.\n\n10. We commence by placing one pound on each of the hooks. The cords are first seen to make a few oscillations and then to settle into a definite position. If we disturb the cords and try to move them into some new position they will not remain there; when released they will return to the places they originally occupied. We now concentrate our attention on the central point d, at which the three forces act. Let this be represented by o in Fig. 4, and the lines op, oq, and os will be the directions of the three cords.\n\nOn examining these positions we find that the three angles p o s, q o s, p o q, are all equal. This may very easily be proved by holding behind the cords a piece of cardboard on which three lines meeting at a point and making equal angles have been drawn; it will then be seen that the cords coincide with the three lines on the cardboard.\n\n\nFig. 4.\n\n11. A little reflection would have led us to anticipate this result. For the three cords being each stretched by a tension of a pound, it is obvious that the three forces pulling at o are all equal. As O is at rest, it seems obvious that the three forces must make the angles equal, for suppose that one of the angles, p o q [Pg 9]for instance, was less than either of the others, experiment shows that the forces o p and oq would be too strong to be counteracted by o s. The three angles must therefore be equal, and then the forces are arranged symmetrically.\n\n12. The forces being each 1 lb., mark off along the three lines in Fig. 4 (which represent their directions) three equal parts o p, o q, o s, and place the arrowheads to show the direction in which each force is acting; the forces are then completely represented both in position and in magnitude.\n\nSince these forces make equilibrium, each of them may be considered to be counteracted by the other two. For example, o s is annulled by o q and o p. But o s could be balanced by a force o r equal and opposite to it. Hence or is capable of producing by itself the same effect as the forces o p and oq taken together. Therefore o r is equivalent to o p and oq. Here we learn the important truth that two forces not in the same direction can be replaced by a single force. The process is called the composition of forces, and the single force is called the resultant of the two forces. o r is only one pound, yet it is equivalent to the forces o p and o q together, each of which is also one pound. This is because the forces o p and o q partly counteract each other.\n\n13. Draw the lines p r and q r; then the angles p o r and q o r are equal, because they are the supplements of the equal angles p o s and q o s; and since the angles p o r and q o r together make up one-third of four right angles, it follows that each of them is two-thirds of one right angle, and therefore equal to the angle of an equilateral triangle. Also o p being equal to o q and o r common, the triangles o p r and o q r must be equilateral. Therefore the angle p r o is equal to the angle r o q; thus p r is parallel to o q; similarly q r is parallel to o p; that is, o p r[Pg 10] q is a parallelogram. Here we first perceive the great law that the resultant of two forces acting at a point is the diagonal of a parallelogram, of which they are the two sides.\n\n14. This remarkable geometrical figure is called the parallelogram of forces. Stated in its general form, the property we have discovered asserts that two forces acting at a point have a resultant, and that this resultant is represented both in magnitude and in direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram, of which two adjacent sides are the lines which represent the forces.\n\n\nFig. 5.\n\n15. The parallelogram of forces may be illustrated in various ways by means of the apparatus of Fig. 3. Attach, for example, to the middle hook g 1\u00b75 lb., and place 1 lb. on each of the remaining hooks e, f. Here the three weights are not equal, and symmetry will not enable us, as it did in the previous case, to foresee the condition which the cords will assume; but they will be observed to settle in a definite position, to which they will invariably return if withdrawn from it.\n\nLet o p, o q (Fig. 5) be the directions of the cords; o p and o q being each of the length which corresponds to 1 lb., while o s corresponds to 1\u00b75 lb. Here, as before, o p and o q together may be considered to counteract o s. But o s could have been counteracted by an equal and opposite force o r. Hence o r may be regarded as the single force equivalent to o p and o q, that is, as their resultant; and thus it is proved experimentally that these forces have a resultant. We can further [Pg 11]verify that the resultant is the diagonal of the parallelogram of which the equal forces are the sides. Construct a parallelogram on a piece of cardboard having its four sides equal, and one of the diagonals half as long again as one of the sides. This may be done very easily by first drawing one of the two triangles into which the diagonal divides the parallelogram. The diagonal is to be produced beyond the parallelogram in the direction o s. When the cardboard is placed close against the cords, the two cords will lie in the directions o p, o q, while the produced diagonal will be in the vertical o s. Thus the application of the parallelogram of force is verified.\n\n\nFig. 6.\n\n16. The same experiment shows that two unequal forces may be compounded into one resultant. For in Fig. 5 the two forces o p and o s may be considered to be counterbalanced by the force o q; in other words, o q must be equal and opposite to a force which is the resultant of o p and o s.\n\n17. Let us place on the central hook g a weight of 5 lbs., and weights of 3 lbs. on the hook e and 4 lbs. on f. This is actually the case shown in Fig. 3. The weights being unequal, we cannot immediately infer anything with reference to the position of the cords, but still we find, as before, that the cords assume a definite position, to which they return when temporarily displaced. Let Fig. 6 represent the positions of the cords. No two of the angles are in this case equal. Still each of the forces is counterbalanced by the other two. Each is therefore equal and opposite to the resultant of the other [Pg 12]two. Construct the parallelogram on cardboard, as can be easily done by forming the triangle o p r, whose sides are 3, 4, and 5, and then drawing o q and r q parallel to r p and o p. Produce the diagonal o r to s. This parallelogram being placed behind the cords, you see that the directions of the cords coincide with its sides and diagonal, thus verifying the parallelogram of forces in a case where all the forces are of different magnitudes.\n\n18. It is easy, by the application of a set square, to prove that in this case the cords attached to the 3 lb. and 4 lb. weights are at right angles to each other. We could have inferred, from the parallelogram of force, that this must be the case, for the sides of the triangle o p r are 3, 4, and 5 respectively, and since the square of 5 is 25, and the squares of 3 and of 4 are 9 and 16 respectively, it follows that the square of one side of this triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two opposite sides, and therefore this is a right-angled triangle (Euclid, i. 48). Hence, since p r is parallel to o q, the angle p o q must also be a right angle.\n\nA SMALL FORCE SOMETIMES BALANCES\nTWO LARGER FORCES.\n 19. Cases might be multiplied indefinitely by placing various amounts of weight on the hooks, constructing the parallelogram on cardboard, and comparing it with the cords as before. We shall, however, confine ourselves to one more illustration, which is capable of very remarkable applications. Attach 1 lb. to each of the hooks e and f; the cord joining them remains straight until drawn down by placing a weight on the centre hook. A very small weight will suffice to do this. Let us put on half-a-pound; the position the cords then [Pg 13]assume is indicated in Fig. 7. As before, each force is equal and opposite to the resultant of the other two. Hence a force of half-a-pound is the resultant of two forces each of 1 lb. The apparent paradox is explained by noticing that the forces of 1 lb. are very nearly opposite, and therefore to a large extent counteract each other. Constructing the cardboard parallelogram we may easily verify that the principle of the parallelogram of forces holds in this case also.\n\n\nFig. 7.\n\n  20. No matter how small be the weight we suspend from the middle of a horizontal cord, you see that the cord is deflected: and no matter how great a tension were applied, it would be impossible to straighten the cord. The cord could break, but it could not again become horizontal. Look at a telegraph wire; it is never in a straight line between two consecutive poles, and its curved form is more evident the greater be the distance between the poles. But in putting up a telegraph wire great straining force is used, by means of special machines for the purpose; yet the wires cannot be straightened: because the weight of the heavy wire itself acts as a force pulling it downwards. Just as the cord in our experiments cannot be straight when any force, however small, is pulling it downwards at the centre, so it is impossible by any exertion of force to straighten the long wire. Some further illustrations of this principle will be given in our next lecture, and with one application of it the present will be concluded.\n\n21. One of the most important practical problems in mechanics is to make a small force overcome a greater. There are a number of ways in [Pg 14]which this may be accomplished for different purposes, and to the consideration of them several lectures of this course will be devoted. Perhaps, however, there is no arrangement more simple than that which is furnished by the principles we have been considering. We shall employ it to raise a 28 lb. weight by means of a 2 lb. weight. I do not say that this particular application is of much practical use. I show it to you rather as a remarkable deduction from the parallelogram of forces than as a useful machine.\n\n\nFig. 8.\n\nA rope is attached at one end of an upright, a (Fig. 8), and passes over a pulley B at the same vertical height about 16' distant. A weight of 28 lbs. is fastened to the free end of the rope, and the supports must be heavily weighted or otherwise secured from moving. The rope ab is apparently straight and horizontal, in consequence of its weight being inappreciable in comparison with the strain (28 lbs.) to which it is subjected; this position is indicated in the figure by the dotted line ab. We now suspend from c at the middle of the rope a weight of 2 lbs. Instantly the rope moves to the position represented in the figure. But this it cannot do without at the same moment raising slightly the 28 lbs., for, since two [Pg 15]sides of a triangle, cb, ca, are greater than the third side, ab, more of the rope must lie between the supports when it is bent down by the 2 lb. weight than when it was straight. But this can only have taken place by shortening the rope between the pulley b and the 28 lb. weight, for the rope is firmly secured at the other end. The effect on the heavy weight is so small that it is hardly visible to you from a distance. We can, however, easily show by an electrical arrangement that the big weight has been raised by the little one.\n\n22. When an electric current passes through this alarum you hear the bell ring, and the moment I stop the current the bell stops. I have fastened one piece of brass to the 28 lb. weight, and another to the support close above it, but unless the weight be raised a little the two will not be in contact; the electricity is intended to pass from one of these pieces of brass to the other, but it cannot pass unless they are touching. When the rope is straight the two pieces of brass are separated, the current does not pass, and our alarum is dumb; but the moment I hang on the 2 lb. weight to the middle of the rope it raises the weight a little, brings the pieces of brass in contact, and now you all hear the alarum. On removing the 2 lbs. the current is interrupted and the noise ceases.\n\n23. I am sure you must all have noticed that the 2 lb. weight descended through a distance of many inches, easily visible to all the room; that is to say, the small weight moved through a very considerable distance, while in so doing it only raised the larger one a very small distance. This is a point of the very greatest importance; I therefore take the first opportunity of calling your attention to it.[Pg 16]\n\nLECTURE II.\nTHE RESOLUTION OF FORCES.\nIntroduction.\u2014One Force resolved into Two Forces.\u2014Experimental Illustrations.\u2014Sailing.\u2014One Force resolved into Three Forces not in the same Plane.\u2014The Jib and Tie-rod.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nFig. 9.\n\n24. As the last lecture was principally concerned with discussing how one force could replace two forces, so in the present we shall examine the converse question, How may two forces replace one force? Since the diagonal of a parallelogram represents a single force equivalent to those represented by the sides, it is obvious that one force may be resolved into two others, provided it be the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by them.\n\n25. We shall frequently employ in the present lecture, and in some of those that follow, the spring balance, which is represented in Fig. 9: the weight is attached to the hook, and when the balance is suspended [Pg 17]by the ring, a pointer indicates the number of pounds on a scale. This balance is very convenient for showing the strain along a cord; for this purpose the balance is held by the ring while the cord is attached to the hook. It will be noticed that the balance has two rings and two corresponding hooks. The hook and ring at the top and bottom will weigh up to 300 lbs., corresponding to the scale which is seen. The hook and ring at the side correspond to another scale on the other face of the plate: this second scale weighs up to about 50 lbs., consequently for a weight under 50 lbs. the side hook and ring are employed, as they give a more accurate result than would be obtained by the top and bottom hook and ring, which are intended for larger weights. These ingenious and useful balances are sufficiently accurate, and can easily be tested by raising known weights. Besides the instrument thus described, we shall sometimes use one of a smaller size, and we shall be able with this aid to trace the existence and magnitude of forces in a most convenient manner.\n\nONE FORCE RESOLVED INTO TWO FORCES.\n26. We shall first illustrate how a single force may be resolved into a pair of forces; for this purpose we shall use the arrangement shown in Fig. 10 (see next page).\n\nThe ends of a cord are fastened to two small spring balances; to the centre e of this cord a weight of 4 lbs. is attached. At a and b are pegs from which the balances can be suspended. Let the distances ae, be be each 12\", and the distance ab 16\". When the cord is thus placed, and the weight allowed to hang freely, each of the cords ea, eb is strained by an amount of force that is shown to be very nearly 3 lbs. by the balances. But the weight of 4 lbs. is the only [Pg 18]weight acting; hence it must be equivalent to two forces of very nearly 3 lbs. each along the directions ae and be. Here the two forces to which 4 lbs. is equivalent are each of them less than 4 lbs., though taken together they exceed it.\n\n\nFig. 10.\n\n27. But remove the cords from ab and hang them on cd, the length cd being 1' 10\", then the forces shown along fc and d are each 5 lbs.; here, therefore, one force of 4 lbs. is equivalent to two forces each of 5 lbs. In the last lecture (Art. 19) we saw that one force could balance two greater forces; here we see the analogous case of one force being changed into two greater forces. Further, we learn that the number of pairs of forces into which one force may be decomposed is unlimited, for with every different distance between the pegs different forces will be indicated by the balances.\n\nWhenever the weight is suspended from a point half-way between the [Pg 19]balances, the forces along the cords are equal; but by placing the weight nearer one balance than the other, a greater force will be indicated on that balance to which the weight is nearest.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL ILLUSTRATIONS.\n\nFig. 11.\n\n  28. The resolution or decomposition of one force into two forces each greater than itself is capable of being illustrated in a variety of ways, two of which will be here explained. In Fig. 11 an arrangement for this purpose is shown. A piece of stout twine ab, able to support from 20 lbs. to 30 lbs., is fastened at one end a to a fixed support, and at the other end b to the eye of a [Pg 20]wire-strainer. A wire-strainer consists of an iron rod, with an eye at one end and a screw and a nut at the other; it is used for tightening wires in wire fencing; and is employed in this case for the purpose of stretching the cord. This being done, I take a piece of ordinary sewing-thread, which is of course weaker than the stout twine. I tie the thread to the middle of the cord at c, catch the other end in my fingers, and pull; something must break\u2014something has broken: but what has broken? Not the slight thread, it is still whole; it is the cord which has snapped. Now this illustrates the point on which we have been dwelling. The force which I transmitted along the thread was [Pg 21]insufficient to break it; the thread transferred the force to the cord, but under such circumstances that the force was greatly magnified, and the consequence was that this magnified force was able to break the cord before the original force could break the thread. We can also see why it was necessary to stretch the cord. In Fig. 10 the strains along the cords are greater when the cords are attached at c and d than when they are attached at a and b; that is to say, the more the cord is stretched towards a straight line, the greater are the forces into which the applied force is resolved.\n\n29. We give a second example, in illustration of the same principle.\n\nIn Fig. 12 is shown a chain 8' long, one end of which b is attached to a wire-strainer, while the other end is fastened to a small piece of pine a, which is 0\"\u00b75 square in section, and 5\" long between the two upright irons by which it is supported. By means of the nut of the wire-strainer I straighten the chain as I did the string of Fig. 11, and for the same reason. I then put a piece of twine round the chain and pull it gently. The strain brought to bear on the wood is so great that it breaks across. Here, the small force of a few pounds, transmitted to the chain by pulling the siring, is magnified to upwards of a hundredweight, for less than this would not break the wood. The explanation is precisely the same as when the string was broken by the thread.\n\n\nFig. 12.\n\nSAILING.\n30. The action of the wind upon the sails of a vessel affords a very instructive and useful example of the decomposition of forces. By the parallelogram of forces we are able to explain how it is that a vessel [Pg 22]is able even to sail against the wind. A force is that which tends to produce motion, and motion generally takes place in the line of the force. In the case of the action of wind on a vessel through the medium of the sails, we have motion produced which is not necessarily in the direction of the wind, and which may be to a certain extent opposed to it. This apparent paradox requires some elucidation.\n\n\nFig. 13.\n\n31. Let us first suppose the wind to be blowing in a direction shown by the arrows of Fig. 13, perpendicular to the line ab in which the ship\u2019s course lies.\n\nIn what direction must the sail be set? It is clear that the sail must not be placed along the line ab, for then the only effect of the wind would be to blow the vessel sideways; nor could the sail be [Pg 23]placed with its edge to the wind, that is, along the line o w, for then the wind would merely glide along the sail without producing a propelling force. Let, then, the sail be placed between the two positions, as in the direction p q. The line o w represents the magnitude of the force of the wind pressing on the sail.\n\nWe shall suppose for simplicity that the sail extends on both sides of o. Through o draw o r perpendicular to p q, and from w let fall the perpendicular w x on p q, and w r on o r. By the principle of the parallelogram of forces, the force o w may be decomposed into the two forces o x and o r, since these are the sides of the parallelogram of which o w, the force of the wind, is the diagonal. We may then leave o w out of consideration, and imagine the force of the wind to be replaced by the pair of forces o x and o r; but the force o x cannot produce an effect, it merely represents a force which glides along the surface of the sail, not one which pushes against it; so far as this component goes, the sail has its edge towards it, and therefore the force produces no effect. On the other hand, the sail is perpendicular to the force o r, and this is therefore the efficient component.\n\nThe force of the wind is thus measured by o r, both in magnitude and direction: this force represents the actual pressure on the mast produced by the sail, and from the mast communicated to the ship. Still o r is not in the direction in which the ship is sailing: we must again decompose the force in order to find its useful effect. This is done by drawing through r the lines r l and r m parallel to o a and o w, thus forming the parallelogram o m r l. Hence, by the parallelogram of forces, the force o r is equivalent to the two forces o l and o m.\n\nThe effect of o l upon the vessel is to propel it in a direction perpendicular to that in which it is sailing. We must, therefore, endeavour to counteract this force as far as possible. This [Pg 24]is accomplished by the keel, and the form of the ship is so designed as to present the greatest possible resistance to being pushed sideways through the water: the deeper the keel the more completely is the effect of o l annulled. Still o l would in all cases produce some leeway were it not for the rudder, which, by turning the head of the vessel a little towards the wind, makes her sail in a direction sufficiently to windward to counteract the small effect of o l in driving her to leeward.\n\nThus o l is disposed of, and the only force remaining is o m, which acts directly to push the vessel in the required direction. Here, then, we see how the wind, aided by the resistance of the water, is able to make the vessel move in a direction perpendicular to that in which the wind blows. We have seen that the sail must be set somewhere between the direction of the wind and that of the ship\u2019s motion. It can be proved that when the direction of the sail supposed to be flat and vertical, is such as to bisect the angle w o b, the magnitude of the force o m is greater than when the sail has any other position.\n\n32. The same principles show how a vessel is able to sail against the wind: she cannot, of course, sail straight against it, but she can sail within half a right angle of it, or perhaps even less. This can be seen from Fig. 14.\n\nThe small arrows represent the wind, as before. Let o w be the line parallel to them, which measures the force of the wind, and let the sail be placed along the line p q; o w is decomposed into o x and o y, o x merely glides along the sail, and o y is the effective force. This is decomposed into o l and o m; o l is counteracted, as already explained, and o m is the force that propels the vessel onwards. Hence we see that there is a force acting to push the vessel onwards, even though the movement be partly against the wind.[Pg 25]\n\n\nFig. 14.\n\nIt will be noticed in this case that the force o l acting to leewards exceeds o m pushing onwards. Hence it is that vessels with a very deep keel, and therefore opposing very great resistance to moving leewards, can sail more closely to the wind than others not so constructed; a vessel should be formed so that she shall move as freely as possible in the direction of her length, for which reason she is sharpened at the bow, and otherwise shaped for gliding through the water easily; this is in order that o m may have to overcome as little resistance as possible. If the sail were flat and vertical it should bisect the angle a ow for the wind to act in the most efficient manner. Since, then, a vessel can sail towards the wind, it follows that, by taking a zigzag course, she can proceed from one port to another, even though the wind be blowing from the place to which she would go towards the place from which she comes. This well known man\u0153uvre is called \u201ctacking.\u201d You will understand that in [Pg 26]a sailing-vessel the rudder has a more important part to play than in a steamer: in the latter it is only useful for changing the direction of the vessel\u2019s motion, while in the former it is not only necessary for changing the direction, but must also be used to keep the vessel to her course by counteracting the effect of leeway.\n\nONE FORCE RESOLVED INTO THREE FORCES\nNOT IN THE SAME PLANE.\n\nFig. 15.\n\n33. Up to the present we have only been considering forces which lie in the same plane, but in nature we meet with forces acting in all directions, and therefore we must not be satisfied with confining our inquiries to the simpler case. We proceed to show, in two different ways, how a force can be decomposed into three forces not in the same plane, though passing through the same point. The first mode of doing so is as follows. To three points a, b, c[Pg 27] (Fig. 15) three spring balances are attached; a, b, c are not in the same straight line, though they are at the same vertical height: to the spring balances cords are attached, which unite in a point o, from which a weight w is suspended. This weight is supported by the three cords, and the strains along these cords are indicated by the spring balances. The greatest strain is on the shortest cord and the least strain on the longest. Here the force w lbs. produces three forces which, taken together, exceed its own amount. If I add an equal weight w, I find, as we might have anticipated, that the strains indicated by the scales are precisely double what they were before. Thus we see that the proportion of the force to each of the components into which it is decomposed does not depend on the actual magnitude of the force, but on the relative direction of the force and its components.\n\n\nFig. 16.\n\n34. Another mode of showing the decomposition of one force into three forces not in the same plane is represented in Fig. 16. The tripod is formed of three strips of pine, 4' \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, secured by a piece of wire running through each at the top; one end of this wire hangs down, and carries a hook to which is attached a weight of 28 lbs. This weight is supported by the wire, but the strain on the wire must be borne by the three wooden rods: hence there is a force acting downwards through the wooden rods. We cannot render this manifest by a contrivance like [Pg 28]the spring scales, because it is a push instead of a pull. However, by raising one of the legs I at once become aware that there is a force acting downwards through it. The weight is, then, decomposed into three forces, which act downwards through the legs; these three forces are not in a plane, and the three forces taken together are larger than the weight.\n\n35. The tripod is often used for supporting weights; it is convenient on account of its portability, and it is very steady. You may judge of its strength by the model represented in the figure, for though the legs are very slight, yet they support very securely a considerable weight. The pulleys by means of which gigantic weights are raised are often supported by colossal tripods. They possess stability and steadiness in addition to great strength.\n\n36. An important point may be brought out by contrasting the arrangements of Figs. 15 and 16. In the one case three cords are used, and in the other three rods. Three rods would have answered for both, but three cords would not have done for the tripod. In one the cords are strained, and the tendency of the strain is to break the cords, but in the other the nature of the force down the rods is entirely different; it does not tend to pull the rod asunder, it is trying to crush the rod, and had the weight been large enough the rods would bend and break. I hold one end of a pencil in each hand and then try to pull the pencil asunder; the pencil is in the condition of the cords of Fig. 15; but if instead of pulling I push my hands together, the pencil is like the rods in Fig. 16.\n\n  37. This distinction is of great importance in mechanics. A rod or cord in a state of tension is called a \u201ctie\u201d; while a rod in a state of compression is called a \u201cstrut.\u201d Since a rod can resist both tension [Pg 29]and compression it can serve either as a tie or as a strut, but a cord or chain can only act as a tie. A pillar is always a strut, as the superincumbent load makes it to be in a state of compression. These distinctions will be very frequently used during this course of lectures, and it is necessary that they be thoroughly understood.\n\nTHE JIB AND TIE ROD.\n  38. As an illustration of the nature of the \u201ctie\u201d and \u201cstrut,\u201d and also for the purpose of giving a useful example of the decomposition of forces, I use the apparatus of Fig. 17 (see next page).\n\nIt represents the principle of the framework in the common lifting crane, and has numerous applications in practical mechanics. A rod of wood b c 3' 6\" long and 1\" \u00d7 1\" section is capable of turning round its support at the bottom b by means of a joint or hinge: this rod is called the \u201cjib\u201d; it is held at its upper end by a tie a c 3' long, which is attached to the support above the joint. a b is one foot long. From the point c a wire descends, having a hook at the end on which a weight can be hung. The tie is attached to the spring balance, the index of which shows the strain. The spring balance is secured by a wire-strainer, by turning the nut of which the length of the wire can be shortened or lengthened as occasion requires. This is necessary, because when different weights are suspended from the hook the spring is stretched more or less, and the screw is then employed to keep the entire length of the tie at 3'. The remainder of the tie consists of copper wire.\n\n39. Suppose a weight of 20 lbs. be suspended from the hook w, it endeavours to pull the top of the jib downwards; but the tie holds [Pg 30]it back, consequently the tie is put into a state of tension, as indeed its name signifies, and the magnitude of that tension is shown to be 60 lbs. by the spring balance. Here we find again what we have already so often referred to; namely, one force developing another force that is greater than itself, for the strain along the tie is three times as great as the strain in the vertical wire by which it was produced.\n\n\nFig. 17.\n\n40. What is the condition of the jib? It is evidently being pushed downwards on its joint at b; it is therefore in a state of compression; it is a strut. This will be evident if we think for a [Pg 31]moment how absurd it would be to endeavour to replace the jib by a string or chain: the whole arrangement would collapse. The weight of 20 lbs. is therefore decomposed by this contrivance into two other forces, one of which is resisted by a tie and the other by a strut.\n\n\nFig. 18.\n\n41. We have no means of showing the magnitude of the strain along the strut, but we shall prove that it can be computed by means of the parallelogram of force; this will also explain how it is that the tie is strained by a force three times that of the weight which is used. Through c (Fig. 18) draw c p parallel to the tie a b, and p q parallel to the strut c b then b p is the diagonal of the parallelogram whose sides are each equal to b c and b q. If therefore we consider the force of 20 lbs. to be represented by b p, the two forces into which it is decomposed will be shown by b q and b c; but a b is equal to b q, since each of them is equal to c p; also b p is equal to a c. Hence the weight of 20 lbs. being represented by a c, the strain along the tie will be represented by the length a b, and that along the strut by the length b c. Remembering that a b is 3' long, c b 3' 6\", and a c 1', [Pg 32]it follows that the strain along the tie is 60 lbs., and along the strut 70 lbs., when the weight of 20 lbs. is suspended from the hook.\n\n42. In every other case the strains along the tie and strut can be determined, when the suspended weight is known, by their proportionality to the sides of the triangle formed by the tie, the jib, and the upright post, respectively.\n\n43. In this contrivance you will recognize, no doubt, the framework of the common lifting crane, but that very essential portion of the crane which provides for the raising and lowering is not shown here. To this we shall return again in a subsequent lecture (Art. 332). You will of course understand that the tie rod we have been considering is entirely different from the chain for raising the load.\n\n44. It is easy to see of what importance to the engineer the information acquired by means of the decomposition of forces may become. Thus in the simple case with which we are at present engaged, suppose an engineer were required to erect a frame which was to sustain a weight of 10 tons, let us see how he would be enabled to determine the strength of the tie and jib. It is of importance in designing any structure not to make any part unnecessarily strong, as doing so involves a waste of valuable material, but it is of still more vital importance to make every part strong enough to avoid the risk of accident, not only under ordinary circumstances, but also under the exceptionally great shocks and strains to which every machine is liable.\n\n  45. According to the numerical proportions we have employed for illustration, the strain along the tie rod would be 30 tons when the load was 10 tons, and therefore the tie must at least be strong enough to bear a pull of 30 tons; but it is customary, in good engineering practice, to make the machine of about ten times the strength that would just be sufficient to sustain the ordinary load. Hence the crank [Pg 33]must be so strong that the tie would not break with a tension less than 300 tons, which would be produced when the crane was lifting 100 tons. So great a margin of safety is necessary on account of the jerks and other occasional great strains that arise in the raising and the lowering of heavy weights. For a crane intended to raise 10 tons, the engineer must therefore design a tie rod which not less than 300 tons would tear asunder. It has been proved by actual trial that a rod of wrought iron of average quality, one square inch in section, can just withstand a pull of twenty tons. Hence fifteen such rods, or one rod the section of which was equal to fifteen square inches, would be just able to resist 300 tons; and this is therefore the proper area of section for the tie rod of the crane we have been considering.\n\n46. In the same way we ascertain the actual thrust down the jib; it amounts to 35 tons, and the jib should be ten times as strong as a strut which would collapse under a strain of 35 tons.\n\n47. It is easy to see from the figure that the tie rod is pulling the upright, and tending, in fact, to make it snap off near b. It is therefore necessary that the upright support a b (Fig. 17) be secured very firmly.[Pg 34]\n\nLECTURE III.\nPARALLEL FORCES.\nIntroduction.\u2014Pressure of a Loaded Beam on its Supports.\u2014Equilibrium of a Bar supported on a Knife-edge.\u2014The Composition of Parallel Forces.\u2014Parallel Forces acting in opposite directions.\u2014The Couple.\u2014The Weighing Scales.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n48. The parallelogram of forces enables us to find the resultant of two forces which intersect: but since parallel forces do not intersect, the construction does not avail to determine the resultant of two parallel forces. We can, however, find this resultant very simply by other means.\n\n\nFig. 19.\n\n49. Fig. 19 represents a wooden rod 4' long, sustained by resting on two supports a and b, and having the length a b divided into 14 equal parts. Let a weight of 14 lbs. be hung on the rod at its middle point c; this weight must be borne by [Pg 35]the supports, and it is evident that they will bear the load in equal shares, for since the weight is at the middle of the rod there is no reason why one end should be differently circumstanced from the other. Hence the total pressure on each of the supports will be 7 lbs., together with half the weight of the wooden bar.\n\n50. If the weight of 14 lbs. be placed, not at the centre of the bar, but at some other point such as d, it is not then so easy to see in what proportion the weight is distributed between the supports. We can easily understand that the support near the weight must bear more than the remote one, but how much more? When we are able to answer this question, we shall see that it will lead us to a knowledge of the composition of parallel forces.\n\nPRESSURE OF A LOADED BEAM\nON ITS SUPPORTS.\n  51. To study this question we shall employ the apparatus shown in Fig. 20. An iron bar 5' 6\" long, weighing 10 lbs., rests in the hooks of the spring balances a, c, in the manner shown in the figure. These hooks are exactly five feet apart, so that the bar projects 3\" beyond each end. The space between the hooks is divided into twenty equal portions, each of course 3\" long. The bar is sufficiently strong to bear the weight b of 20 lbs. suspended from it by an S hook, without appreciable deflection. Before the weight of 20 lbs. is suspended, the spring balances each show a strain of 5 lbs. We would expect this, for it is evident that the whole weight of the bar amounting to 10 lbs. should be borne equally by the two supports.\n\n52. When I place the weight in the middle, 10 divisions from each end, I find the balances each indicate 15 lbs. But 5 lbs. is due to the weight of the bar. Hence the 20 lbs. is divided equally, as we have [Pg 36]already stated that it should be. But let the 20 lbs. be moved to any other position, suppose 4 divisions from the right, and 16 from the left; then the right-hand scale reads 21 lbs., and the left-hand reads 9 lbs. To get rid of the weight of the bar itself, we must subtract 5 lbs. from each. We learn therefore that the 20 lb. weight pulls the right-hand spring balance with a strain of 16 lbs., and the left with a strain of 4 lbs. Observe this closely; you see I have made the number of divisions in the bar equal to the number of pounds weight suspended from it, and here we find that when the weight is 16 divisions from the left, the strain of 16 lbs. is shown on the right. At the same time the weight is 4 divisions from the right, and 4 lbs. is the strain shown to the left.\n\n\nFig. 20.\n\n[Pg 37]  53. I will state the law of the distribution of the load a little more generally, and we shall find that the bar will prove the law to be true in all cases. Divide the bar into as many equal parts as there are pounds in the load, then the pressure in pounds on one end is the number of divisions that the load is distant from the other.\n\n54. For example, suppose I place the load 2 divisions from one end: I read by the scale at that end 23 lbs.; subtracting 5 lbs. for the weight of the bar, the pressure due to the load is shown to be 18 lbs., but the weight is then exactly 18 divisions distant from the other end. We can easily verify this rule whatever be the position which the load occupies.\n\n55. If the load be placed between two marks, instead of being, as we have hitherto supposed, exactly at one, the partition of the load is also determined by the law. Were it, for example, 3\u00b75 divisions from one end, the strain on the other would be 3\u00b75 lbs.; and in like manner for other cases.\n\n56. We have thus proved by actual experiment this useful and instructive law of nature; the same result could have been inferred by reasoning from the parallelogram of force, but the purely experimental proof is more in accordance with our scheme. The doctrine of the composition of parallel forces is one of the most fundamental parts of mechanics, and we shall have many occasions to employ it in this as well as in subsequent lectures.\n\n57. Returning now to Fig. 19, with which we commenced, the law we have discovered will enable us to find how the weight is distributed. We divide the length of the bar between the supports into 14 equal parts because the weight is 14 lbs.; if, then, the weight be at d, 10 divisions from one end a, and 4 from the other b, [Pg 38]the pressure at the corresponding ends will be 4 and 10. If the weight were 2\u00b75 divisions from one end, and therefore 11\u00b75 from the other, the shares in which this load would be supported at the ends are 11\u00b75 lbs. and 2\u00b75 lbs. The actual pressure sustained by each end is, however, about 6 ounces greater if the weight of the wooden bar itself be taken into account.\n\n58. Let us suspend a second weight from another point of the bar. We must then calculate the pressures at the ends which each weight separately would produce, and those at the same end are to be added together, and to half the weight of the bar, to find the total pressure. Thus, if one weight of 20 lbs. were in the middle, and another of 14 lbs. at a distance of 11 divisions from one end, the middle weight would produce 10 lbs. at each end and the 14 lbs. would produce 3 lbs. and 11 lbs., and remembering the weight of the bar, the total pressures produced would be 13 lbs. 6 oz. and 21 lbs. 6 oz. The same principles will evidently apply to the case of several weights: and the application of the rule becomes especially easy when all the weights are equal, for then the same divisions will serve for calculating the effect of each weight.\n\n59. The principles involved in these calculations are of so much importance that we shall further examine them by a different method, which has many useful applications.\n\nEQUILIBRIUM OF A BAR SUPPORTED\nON A KNIFE-EDGE.\n  60. The weight of the bar has hitherto somewhat complicated our calculations; the results would appear more simply if we could avoid this weight; but since we want a strong bar, its weight is not so small [Pg 39]that we could afford to overlook it altogether. By means of the arrangement of Fig. 21, we can counterpoise the weight of the bar. [Pg 40]To the centre of A B a cord is attached, which, passing over a fixed pulley D, carries a hook at the other end. The bar, being a pine rod, 4 feet long and 1 inch square, weighs about 12 ounces; consequently, if a weight of twelve ounces be suspended from the hook, the bar will be counterpoised, and will remain at whatever height it is placed.\n\n\nFig. 21.\n\n61. a b is divided by lines drawn along it at distances of 1\" apart; there are thus 48 of these divisions. The weights employed are furnished with rings large enough to enable them to be slipped on the bar and thus placed in any desired position.\n\n62. Underneath the bar lies an important portion of the arrangement; namely, the knife-edge c. This is a blunt edge of steel firmly fastened to the support which carries it. This support can be moved along underneath the bar so that the knife-edge can be placed under any of the divisions required. The bar being counterpoised, though still unloaded with weights, may be brought down till it just touches the knife-edge; it will then remain horizontal, and will retain this position whether the knife-edge be at either end of the bar or in any intermediate position. I shall hang weights at the extremities of the rod, and we shall find that there is for each pair of weights just one position at which, if the knife-edge be placed, it will sustain the rod horizontally. We shall then examine the relations between these distances and the weights that have been attached, and we shall trace the connection between the results of this method and those of the arrangement that we last used.\n\n63. Supposing that 6 lbs. be hung at each end of the rod, we might easily foresee that the knife-edge should be placed in the middle, and we find our anticipations verified. When the edge is exactly at the middle, the rod remains horizontal; but if it be moved, even through a [Pg 41]very small distance, to either side, the rod instantly descends on the other. The knife-edge is 24 inches distant from each end; and if I multiply this number by the number of pounds in the weight, in this case 6, I find 144 for the product, and this product is the same for both ends of the bar. The importance of this remark will be seen directly.\n\n  64. If I remove one of the 6 lb. weights and replace it by 2 lbs., leaving the other weight and the knife-edge unaltered, the bar instantly descends on the side of the heavy weight; but, by slipping the knife-edge along the bar, I find that when I have moved it to within a distance of 12 inches from the 6 lbs., and therefore 36 inches from the 2 lbs., the bar will remain horizontal. The edge must be put carefully at the right place; a quarter of an inch to one side or the other would upset the bar. The whole load borne by the knife-edge is of course 8 lbs., being the sum of the weights. If we multiply 2, the number of pounds at one end, by 36, the distance of that end from the knife-edge, we obtain the product 72; and we find precisely the same product by multiplying 6, the number of pounds in the other weight, by 12, its distance from the knife-edge. To express this result concisely we shall introduce the word moment, a term of frequent use in mechanics. The 2 lb. weight produces a force tending to pull its end of the bar downwards by making the bar turn round the knife-edge. The magnitude of this force, multiplied into its distance from the knife-edge, is called the moment of the force. We can express the result at which we have arrived by saying that, when the knife-edge has been so placed that the bar remains horizontal, the moments of the forces about the knife-edge are equal.\n\n65. We may further illustrate this law by suspending weights of 7 lbs. [Pg 42]and 5 lbs. respectively from the ends of the bar; it is found that the knife-edge must then be placed 20 inches from the larger weight, and, therefore, 28 inches from the smaller, but 5 \u00d7 28 = 140, and 7 \u00d7 20 = 140, thus again verifying the law of equality of the moments.\n\nFrom the equality of the moments we can also deduce the law for the distribution of the load given in Art. 53. Thus, taking the figures in the last experiment, we have loads of 7 lbs. and 5 lbs. respectively. These produce a pressure of 7 + 5 = 12 lbs. on the knife-edge. This edge presses on the bar with an equal and opposite reaction. To ascertain the distribution of this pressure on the ends of the beam, we divide the whole beam into 12 equal parts of 4 inches each, and the 7 lb. weight is 5 of these parts, i.e., 20 inches distant from the support. Hence the edge should be 20 inches from the greater weight, which is the condition also implied by the equality of the moments.\n\nTHE COMPOSITION OF PARALLEL FORCES.\n66. Having now examined the subject experimentally, we proceed to investigate what may be learned from the results we have proved.\n\n\nFig. 22.\n\nThe weight of the bar being allowed for in the way we have explained, by subtracting one-half of it from each of the strains indicated by the spring balance (Fig. 20), we may omit it from consideration. As the balances are pulled downwards by the bar when it is loaded, so they will react to pull the bar upwards. This will be evident if we think of a weight\u2014say 14 lbs.\u2014suspended from one of these balances: it hangs at rest; therefore its weight, which is constantly urging it downwards, must be counteracted by an equal force pulling it upwards. The balance of course shows 14 lbs.; thus the spring exerts in an [Pg 43]upward pull a force which is precisely equal to that by which it is itself pulled downwards.\n\n67. Hence the springs are exerting forces at the ends of the bar in pulling them upwards, and the scales indicate their magnitudes. The bar is thus subject to three forces, viz.: the suspended weight of 20 lbs., which acts vertically downwards, and the two other forces which act vertically upwards, and the united action of the three make equilibrium.\n\n68. Let lines be drawn, representing the forces in the manner already explained. We have then three parallel forces ap, bq, cr acting on a rod in equilibrium (Fig. 22). The two forces ap and bq may be considered as balanced by the force cr in the position shown in the figure, but the force cr would be balanced by the equal and opposite force cs, represented by the dotted line. Hence this last force is equivalent to ap and bq. In other words, it must be their resultant. Here then we learn that a pair of parallel forces, acting in the same direction, can be compounded into a single resultant.\n\n69. We also see that the magnitude of the resultant is equal to the sum of the magnitudes of the forces, and further we find the position of the resultant by the following rule. Add the two forces together; divide the distance between them into as many equal parts as are contained in the sum, measure off from the greater of these two forces as many parts as there are pounds in the smaller force, and that is the point required. This rule is very easily inferred from that which we were taught by the experiments in Art. 51.[Pg 44]\n\nPARALLEL FORCES ACTING IN\nOPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.\n70. Since the forces ap, bq, cr (Fig. 22) are in equilibrium, it follows that we may look on bq as balancing in the position which it occupies the two forces of ap and cr in their positions. This may remind us of the numerous instances we have already met with, where one force balanced two greater forces: in the present case ap and cr are acting in opposite directions, and the force bq which balances them is equal to their difference. A force bt equal and opposite to bq must then be the resultant of cr and ap, since it is able to produce the same effect. Notice that in this case the resultant of the two forces is not between them, but that it lies on the side of the larger. When the forces act in the same direction, the resultant is always between them.\n\n71. The actual position which the resultant of two opposite parallel forces occupies is to be found by the following rule. Divide the distance between the forces into as many equal parts as there are pounds in their difference, then measure outwards from the point of application of the larger force as many of these parts as there are pounds in the smaller force; the point thus found determines the position of the resultant. Thus, if the forces be 14 and 20, the difference between them is 6, and therefore the distance between their directions is divided into six parts; from the point of application of the force of 20, 14 parts are measured outwards, and thus the position of the resultant is determined. Hence we have the means of compounding two parallel forces in general.\n\nTHE COUPLE.\n72. In one case, however, two parallel forces have no resultant; this [Pg 45]occurs when the two forces are equal, and in opposite directions. A pair of forces of this kind is called a couple; there is no single force which could balance a couple,\u2014it can only be counterbalanced by another couple acting in an opposite manner. This remarkable case, may be studied by the arrangement of Fig. 23.\n\n\nFig. 23.\n\nA wooden rod, a b 48\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, has strings attached to it at points a and d, one foot distant. The string at d passes over a fixed pulley e, and at the end p a hook is attached for the purpose of receiving weights, while a similar hook descends from a; the weight of the rod itself, which only amounts to three ounces, may be neglected, as it is very small compared with the weights which will be used.\n\n73. Supposing 2 lbs. to be placed at p, and 1 lb. at q, we have two parallel forces acting in opposite directions; and since their difference is 1 lb., it follows from our rule that the point f, where d f is equal to a d, is the point where the resultant is applied. You see this is easily verified, for by placing my finger over the rod at f it remains horizontal and in equilibrium; whereas, when I move my finger to one side or the other, equilibrium is impossible. If I move it nearer to b, the end a ascends. If I move it towards a, the end b ascends.[Pg 46]\n\n74. To study the case when the two forces are equal, a load of 2 lbs. may be placed on each of the hooks p and q. It will then be found that the finger cannot be placed in any position along the rod so as to keep it in equilibrium; that is to say, no single force can counteract the two forces which form the couple. Let o be the point midway between a and d. The forces evidently tend to raise ob and turn the part o a downwards; but if I try to restrain o b by holding my finger above, as at the point x, instantly the rod begins to turn round x and the part from a to x descends. I find similarly that any attempt to prevent the motion by holding my finger underneath is equally unsuccessful. But if at the same time I press the rod downwards at one point, and upwards at another with suitable force, I can succeed in producing equilibrium; in this case the two pressures form a couple; and it is this couple which neutralizes the couple produced by the weights. We learn, then, the important result that a couple can be balanced by a couple, and by a couple only.\n\n75. The moment of a couple is the product of one of the two equal forces into their perpendicular distance. Two couples tending to turn the body to which they are applied in the same direction will be equivalent if their moments are equal. Two couples which tend to turn the body in opposite directions will be in equilibrium if their moments are equal. We can also compound two couples in the same or in opposite directions into a single couple of which the moment is respectively either the sum or the difference of the original moments.\n\nTHE WEIGHING SCALES.\n76. Another apparatus by which the nature of parallel forces may be [Pg 47]investigated is shown in Fig. 24; it consists of a slight frame of wood a b c, 4' long. At e, a pair of steel knife-edges is clamped to the frame. The knife-edges rest on two pieces of steel, one of which is shown at o f. When the knife-edges are suitably placed the frame is balanced, so that a small piece of paper laid at a will cause that side to descend.\n\n\nFig. 24.\n\n77. We suspend two small hooks from the points a and b: these are made of fine wire, so that their weight may be left out of consideration. With this apparatus we can in the first place verify the principle of equality of moments: for example, if I place the hook a at a distance of 9\" from the centre o and load it with 1 lb., I find that when b is laden with 0\u00b75 lb. it must be at a distance of 18\" from o in order to counterbalance a; the moment in the one case is 9 \u00d7 1, in the other 18 \u00d7 0\u00b75, and these are obviously equal.\n\n78. Let a weight of 1 lb. be placed on each of the hooks, the frame [Pg 48]will only be in equilibrium when the hooks are at precisely the same distance from the centre. A familiar application of this principle is found in the ordinary weighing scales; the frame, which in this case is called a beam, is sustained by two knife-edges, smaller, however, than those represented in the figure. The pans p, p are suspended from the extremities of the beam, and should be at equal distances from its centre. These scale-pans must be of equal weight, and then, when equal weights are placed in them, the beam will remain horizontal. If the weight in one slightly exceed that in the other, the pan containing the heavier weight will of course descend.\n\n79. That a pair of scales should weigh accurately, it is necessary that the weights be correct; but even with correct weights, a balance of defective construction will give an inaccurate result. The error frequently arises from some inequality in the lengths of the arms of the beam. When this is the case, the two weights which really balance are not equal. Supposing, for instance, that with an imperfect balance I endeavour to weigh a pound of shot. If I put the weight on the short side, then the quantity of shot balanced is less than 1 lb.; while if the 1 lb. weight be placed at the long side, it will require more than 1 lb. of shot to produce equilibrium. The mode of testing a pair of scales is then evident. Let weights be placed in the pans which balance each other; if the weights be interchanged and the balance still remains horizontal, it is correct.\n\n80. Suppose, for example, that the two arms be 10 inches and 11 inches long, then, if 1 lb. weight be placed in the pan of the 10-inch end, its moment is 10; and if \u00b9\u2070/\u2081\u2081 of 1 lb. be placed in the pan belonging to the 11-inch end, its moment is also 10: hence 1 lb. at the short end balances \u00b9\u2070/\u2081\u2081 of 1 lb. at the long end; and therefore, if the shopkeeper placed his weight in the short arm, his customers would lose [Pg 49]\u00b9/\u2081\u2081 part of each pound for which they paid; on the other hand, if the shopkeeper placed his 1 lb. weight on the long arm, then not less than \u00b9\u00b9/\u2081\u2080 lb. would be required in the pan belonging to the short arm. Hence in this case the customer would get \u00b9/\u2081\u2080 lb. too much. It follows, that if a shopman placed his weights and his goods alternately in the one scale and in the other he would be a loser on the whole; for, though every second customer gets \u00b9/\u2081\u2081 lb. less than he ought, yet the others get \u00b9/\u2081\u2080 lb. more than they have paid for.[Pg 50]\n\nLECTURE IV.\nTHE FORCE OF GRAVITY.\nIntroduction.\u2014Specific Gravity.\u2014The Plummet and Spirit-Level.\u2014The Centre of Gravity.\u2014Stable and Unstable Equilibrium.\u2014Property of the Centre of Gravity in a Revolving Wheel.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n81. In the last three lectures we considered forces in the abstract; we saw how they are to be represented by straight lines, how compounded together and how decomposed into others; we have explained what is meant by forces being in equilibrium, and we have shown instances where the forces lie in the same plane or in different planes, and where they intersect or are parallel to each other. These subjects are the elements of mechanics; they form the framework which in this and subsequent lectures we shall try to present in a more attractive garb. We shall commence by studying the most remarkable force in nature, a force constantly in action, and one to which all bodies are subject, a force which distance cannot annihilate, and one the properties of which have led to the most sublime discoveries of human intellect. This is the force of gravity.[Pg 51]\n\n82. If I drop a stone from my hand, it falls to the ground. That which produces motion is a force: hence the stone must have been acted upon by a force which drew it to the ground. On every part of the earth\u2019s surface experience shows that a body tends to fall. This fact proves that there is an attractive force in the earth tending to draw all bodies towards it.\n\n\nFig. 25.\n\n83. Let a b c d (Fig. 25) be points from which stones are let fall, and let the circle represent the section of the earth; let p q r s be the points at the surface of the earth upon which the stones will drop when allowed to do so. The four stones will move in the directions of the arrows: from a to p the stone moves in an opposite direction to the motion from c to r; from b to q it moves from right to left, while from d to s it moves from left to right. The movements are in different directions; but if I produce these directions, as indicated by the dotted lines, they each pass through the centre o.[Pg 52]\n\n84. Hence each stone in falling moves towards the centre of the earth, and this is consequently the direction of the force. We therefore assert that the earth has an attraction for the stone, in consequence of which it tries to get as near the earth\u2019s centre as possible, and this attraction is called the force of gravitation.\n\n85. We are so excessively familiar with the phenomenon of seeing bodies fall that it does not excite our astonishment or arouse our curiosity. A clap of thunder, which every one notices, because much less frequent, is not really more remarkable. We often look with attention at the attraction of a piece of iron by a magnet, and justly so, for the phenomenon is very interesting, and yet the falling of a stone is produced by a far grander and more important force than the force of magnetism.\n\n  86. It is gravity which causes the weight of bodies. I hold a piece of lead in my hand: gravity tends to pull it downwards, thus producing a pressure on my hand which I call weight. Gravity acts with slightly varying intensity at various parts of the earth\u2019s surface. This is due to two distinct causes, one of which may be mentioned here, while the other will be subsequently referred to. The earth is not perfectly spherical; it is flattened a little at the poles; consequently a body at the pole is nearer the general mass of the earth than a body at the equator; therefore the body at the pole is more attracted, and seems heavier. A mass which weighs 200 lbs. at the equator would weigh one pound more at the pole: about one-third of this increase is due to the cause here pointed out. (See Lecture XVII.)\n\n87. Gravity is a force which attracts every particle of matter; it acts not merely on those parts of a body which lie on the surface, but it equally affects those in the interior. This is proved by observing that [Pg 53]a body has the same weight, however its shape be altered: for example, suppose I take a ball of putty which weighs 1 lb., I shall find that its weight remains unchanged when the ball is flattened into a thin plate, though in the latter case the surface, and therefore the number of superficial particles, is larger than it was in the former.\n\nSPECIFIC GRAVITY.\n88. Gravity produces different effects upon different substances. This is commonly expressed by saying that some substances are heavier than others; for example, I have here a piece of wood and a piece of lead of equal bulk. The lead is drawn to the earth with a greater force than the wood. Substances are usually termed heavy when they sink in water, and light when they float upon it. But a body sinks in water if it weighs more than an equal bulk of water, and floats if it weigh less. Hence it is natural to take water as a standard with which the weights of other substances may be compared.\n\n89. I take a certain volume, say a cubic inch of cast iron such as this I hold in my hand, and which has been accurately shaped for the purpose. This cube is heavier than one cubic inch of water, but I shall find that a certain quantity of water is equal to it in weight; that is to say, a certain number of cubic inches of water, and it may be fractional parts of a cubic inch, are precisely of the same weight. This number is called the specific gravity of cast iron.\n\n90. It would be impossible to counterpoise water with the iron without holding the water in a vessel, and the weight of the vessel must then be allowed for. I adopt the following plan. I have here a number of inch cubes of wood (Fig. 26), which would each be lighter than a cubic inch of water, but I have weighted the wooden cubes by placing grains of [Pg 54]shot into holes bored into the wood. The weight of each cube has thus been accurately adjusted to be equal to that of a cubic inch of water. This may be tested by actual weighing. I weigh one of the cubes and find it to be 252 grains, which is well known to be the weight of a cubic inch of water.\n\n\nFig. 26.\n\n91. But the cubes may be shown to be identical in weight with the same bulk of water by a simpler method. One of them placed in water should have no tendency to sink, since it is not heavier than water, nor on the other hand, since it is not lighter, should it have any tendency to float. It should then remain in the water in whatever position it may be placed. It is difficult to prepare one of these cubes so accurately [Pg 55]that this result should be attained, and it is impossible to ensure its continuance for any time owing to changes of temperature and the absorption of water by the wood. We can, however, by a slight modification, prove that one of these cubes is at all events nearly equal in weight to the same bulk of water. In Fig. 26 is shown a tall glass jar filled with a fluid in appearance like plain water, but it is really composed in the following manner. I first poured into the jar a very weak solution of salt and water, which partially filled it; I then poured gently upon this a little pure water, and finally filled up the jar with water containing a little spirits of wine: the salt and water is a little heavier than pure water, while the spirit and water is a little lighter. I take one of the cubes and drop it gently into the glass; it falls through the spirit and water, and after making a few oscillations settles itself at rest in the stratum shown in the figure. This shows that our prepared cube is a little heavier than spirit and water, and a little lighter than salt and water, and hence we infer that it must at all events be very near the weight of pure water which lies between the two. We have also a number of half cubes, quarter cubes, and half-quarter cubes, which have been similarly prepared to be of equal weight with an equal bulk of water.\n\n92. We shall now be able to measure the specific gravity of a substance. In one pan of the scales I place the inch cube of cast iron, and I find that 7\u00bc of the wooden cubes, which we may call cubes of water, will balance it. We therefore say that the specific gravity of iron is 7\u00bc. The exact number found by more accurate methods is 7\u00b72. It is often convenient to remember that 23 cubic inches of cast iron weigh 6 lbs., and that therefore one cubic inch weighs very nearly \u00bc lb.[Pg 56]\n\n93. I have also cubes of brass, lead, and ivory; by counterpoising them with the cubes of water, we can easily find their specific gravities; they are shown together with that of cast iron in the following table:\u2014\n\nSubstance. \u2003 \tSpecific Gravity.\nCast Iron\t7\u00b72\nBrass\t8\u00b71\nLead\t11\u00b73\nIvory\t1\u00b78\n94. The mode here adopted of finding specific gravities is entirely different from the far more accurate methods which are commonly used, but the explanation of the latter involve more difficult principles than those we have been considering. Our method rather offers an explanation of the nature of specific gravity than a good means of determining it, though, as we have seen, it gives a result sufficiently near the truth for many purposes.\n\nTHE PLUMMET AND SPIRIT-LEVEL.\n95. The tendency of the earth to draw all bodies towards it is well illustrated by the useful \u201cline and plummet.\u201d This consists merely of a string to one end of which a leaden weight is attached. The string when at rest hangs vertically; if the weight be drawn to one side, it will, when released, swing backwards and forwards, until it finally settles again in the vertical; the reason is that the weight always tries to get as near the earth as it can, and this is accomplished when the string hangs vertically downwards.\n\n96. The surface of water in equilibrium is a horizontal plane; that is also a consequence of gravity. All the particles of water try to get as near the earth as possible, and therefore if any portion of the water were higher than the rest, it would immediately spread, as by doing so it could get lower.[Pg 57]\n\n97. Hence the surface of a fluid at rest enables us to find a perfectly horizontal plane, while the plummet gives us a perfectly vertical line: both these consequences of gravity are of the utmost practical importance.\n\n98. The spirit-level is another common and very useful instrument which depends on gravity. It consists of a glass tube slightly curved, with its convex surface upwards, and attached to a stand with a flat base. This tube is nearly filled with spirit, but a bubble of air is allowed to remain. The tube is permanently adjusted so that, when the plate is laid on a perfectly horizontal surface, the bubble will stand in the middle: accordingly the position of the bubble gives a means of ascertaining whether a surface is level.\n\nTHE CENTRE OF GRAVITY.\n\nFig. 27.\n\n99. We proceed to an experiment which will give an insight into a curious property of gravity. I have here a plate of sheet iron; it has the irregular shape shown in Fig. 27. Five small holes a b c d e are punched at different positions on the margin. Attached to the framework is a small pin from which I can suspend the iron plate by one of its holes a: the plate is not supported in any other way; it hangs freely from the pin, around which it can be easily turned. I find that there is one position, and one only, in which the plate will rest; if I withdraw it from that position it returns there after a few oscillations. In order to mark this position, I suspend a [Pg 58]line and plummet from the pin, having rubbed the line with chalk. I allow the line to come to rest in front of the plate. I then flip the string against the plate, and thus produce a chalked mark: this of course traces out a vertical line a p on the plate.\n\nI now remove the plummet and suspend the plate from another of its holes b, and repeat the process, thus drawing a second chalked line b p across the plate, and so on with the other holes: I thus obtain five lines across the plate, represented by dotted lines in the figure. It is a very remarkable circumstance that these five lines all intersect in the same point p; and if additional holes were bored in the plate, whether in the margin or not, and the chalk line drawn from each of them in the manner described, they would one and all pass through the same point. This remarkable point is called the centre of gravity of the plate, and the result at which we have arrived may be expressed by saying that the vertical line from the point of suspension always passes through the centre of gravity.\n\n100. At the centre of gravity p a hole has been bored, and when I place the supporting pin through this hole you see that the plate will rest indifferently in all positions: this is a curious property of the centre of gravity. The centre of gravity may in this respect be contrasted with another hole q, which is only an inch distant: when I support the plate by this hole, it has only one position of rest, viz. when the centre of gravity p is vertically beneath q. Thus the centre of gravity differs remarkably from any other point in the plate.\n\n101. We may conceive the force of gravity on the plate to act as a force applied at p. It will then be easily seen why this point remains vertically underneath the point of suspension when the body is at rest. If I attached a string to the plate and pulled it, the plate [Pg 59]would evidently place itself so that the direction of the string would pass through the point of suspension; in like manner gravity so places the plate that the direction of its force passes through the point of suspension.\n\n102. Whatever be the form of the plate it always contains one point possessing these remarkable properties, and we may state in general that in every body, no matter what be its shape, there is a point called the centre of gravity, such that if the body be suspended from this point it will remain in equilibrium indifferently in any position, and that if the body be suspended from any other point, then it will be in equilibrium when the centre of gravity is directly underneath the point of suspension. In general, it will be impossible to support a body exactly at its centre of gravity, as this point is within the mass of the body, and it may also sometimes happen that the centre of gravity does not lie in the substance of the body at all, as for example in a ring, in which case the centre of gravity is at the centre of the ring. We need not, however, dwell on these exceptional cases, as sufficient illustrations of the truth of the laws mentioned will present themselves subsequently.\n\nSTABLE AND UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM.\n\nFig. 28.\n\n  103. An iron rod a b, capable of revolving round an axis passing through its centre p, is shown in Fig. 28.\n\nThe centre of gravity lies at the centre b, and consequently, as is easily seen, the rod will remain at rest in whatever position it be placed. But let a weight r be attached to the rod by means of a binding screw. The centre of gravity of the whole is no longer at the centre of the rod; it has moved to a point s nearer the weight; we may easily ascertain its position by removing the rod from its axle and then ascertaining the point about which it will balance. [Pg 60]This may be done by placing the bar on a knife-edge, and moving it to and fro until the right position be secured; mark this position on the rod, and return it to its axle, the weight being still attached. We do not now find that the rod will balance in every position. You see it will balance if the point s be directly underneath the axis, but not if it lie to one side or the other. But if s be directly over the axis, as in the figure, the rod is in a curious condition. It will, when carefully placed, remain at rest; but if it receive the slightest displacement, it will tumble over. The rod is in equilibrium in this position, but it is what is called unstable equilibrium. If the centre of gravity be vertically below the point of suspension, the rod will return again if moved away: this position is therefore called one of stable equilibrium. It is very important to notice the distinction between these two kinds of equilibrium.\n\n104. Another way of stating the case is as follows. A body is in stable equilibrium when its centre of gravity is at the lowest point: unstable when it is at the highest. This may be very simply illustrated by an ellipse, which I hold in my hand. The centre of gravity of this figure is at its centre. The ellipse, when resting on its side, is in a position of stable equilibrium and its centre of gravity is then clearly at its lowest point. But I can also balance the ellipse on its narrow end, though if I do so the smallest touch suffices to overturn it. The ellipse is then in unstable equilibrium; in this case, obviously, the centre of gravity is at the highest point.[Pg 61]\n\n\nFig. 29.\n\n105. I have here a sphere, the centre of gravity of which is at its centre; in whatever way the sphere is placed on a plane, its centre is at the same height, and therefore cannot be said to have any highest or lowest point; in such a case as this the equilibrium is neutral. If the body be displaced, it will not return to its old position, as it would have done had that been a position of stable equilibrium, nor will it deviate further therefrom as if the equilibrium had been unstable: it will simply remain in the new position to which it is brought.\n\n106. I try to balance an iron ring upon the end of a stick h, Fig. 29, but I cannot easily succeed in doing so. This is because its centre of gravity s is above the point of support; but if I place the stick at f, the ring is in stable equilibrium, for now the centre of gravity is below the point of support.\n\nPROPERTY OF THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY\nIN A REVOLVING WHEEL.\n107. There are other curious consequences which follow from the properties of the centre of gravity, and we shall conclude by illustrating one of the most remarkable, which is at the same time of the utmost importance in machinery.\n\n\nFig. 30.\n\n108. It is generally necessary that a machine should work as steadily as possible, and that undue vibration and shaking of the framework should be avoided: this is particularly the case when any parts of the machine rotate with great velocity, as, if these be heavy, inconvenient vibration will be produced when the proper adjustments are not made. [Pg 62]The connection between this and the centre of gravity will be understood by reference to the apparatus represented in the accompanying figure (Fig. 30). We have here an arrangement consisting of a large cog wheel c working into a small one b, whereby, when the handle h is turned, a velocity of rotation can be given to the iron disk d, which weighs 14 lbs, and is 18\" in diameter. This disk being uniform, and being attached to the axis at its centre, it follows that its centre of gravity is also the centre of rotation. The wheels are attached to a stand, which, though massive, is still unconnected with the floor. By turning the handle I [Pg 63]can rotate the disk very rapidly, even as much as twelve times in a second. Still the stand remains quite steady, and even the shutter bell attached to it at e is silent.\n\n109. Through one of the holes in the disk d I fasten a small iron bolt and a few washers, altogether weighing about 1 lb.; that is, only one-fourteenth of the weight of the disk. When I turn the handle slowly, the machine works as smoothly as before; but as I increase the speed up to one revolution every two seconds, the bell begins to ring violently, and when I increase it still more, the stand quite shakes about on the floor. What is the reason of this? By adding the bolt, I slightly altered the position of the centre of gravity of the disk, but I made no change of the axis about which the disk rotated, and consequently the disk was not on this occasion turning round its centre of gravity: this it was which caused the vibration. It is absolutely necessary that the centre of gravity of any heavy piece, rotating rapidly about an axis, should lie in the axis of rotation. The amount of vibration produced by a high velocity may be very considerable, even when a very small mass is the originating cause.\n\n110. In order that the machine may work smoothly again, it is not necessary to remove the bolt from the hole. If by any means I bring back the centre of gravity to the axis, the same end will be attained. This is very simply effected by placing a second bolt of the same size at the opposite side of the disk, the two being at equal distances from the axis; on turning the handle, the machine is seen to work as smoothly as it did in the first instance.\n\n111. The most common rotating pieces in machines are wheels of various kinds, and in these the centre of gravity is evidently identical with the centre of rotation; but if from any cause a wheel, which is to turn [Pg 64]rapidly, has an extra weight attached to one part, this weight must be counterpoised by one or more on other portions of the wheel, in order to keep the centre of gravity of the whole in its proper place. Thus it is that the driving wheels of a locomotive are always weighted so as to counteract the effect of the crank and restore the centre of gravity to the axis of rotation. The cause of the vibration will be understood after the lecture on centrifugal force (Lect. XVII.).[Pg 65]\n\nLECTURE V.\nTHE FORCE OF FRICTION.\nThe Nature of Friction.\u2014The Mode of Experimenting.\u2014Friction is proportional to the pressure.\u2014A more accurate form of the Law.\u2014The Coefficient varies with the weights used.\u2014The Angle of Friction.\u2014Another Law of Friction.\u2014Concluding Remarks.\n\nTHE NATURE OF FRICTION.\n112. A discussion of the force of friction is a necessary preliminary to the study of the mechanical powers which we shall presently commence. Friction renders the inquiry into the mechanical powers more difficult than it would be if this force were absent; but its effects are too important to be overlooked.\n\n\nFig. 31.\n\n113. The nature of friction may be understood by Fig. 31, which represents a section of the top of a table of wood or any other substance levelled so that c d is horizontal; on the table rests a block a of wood or any other substance. To a a cord is attached, which, after passing over a pulley p, is [Pg 66]stretched by a suspended weight b. If the magnitude of b exceeds a certain limit, then a is pulled along the table and b descends; but if b be smaller than this limit, both a and b remain at rest. When b is not heavy enough to produce motion it is supported by the tension of the cord, which is itself neutralized by the friction produced by a certain coherence between a and the table. Friction is by this experiment proved to be a force, because it prevents the motion of b. Indeed friction is generally manifested as a force by destroying motion, though sometimes indirectly producing it.\n\n114. The true source of the force lies in the inevitable roughness of all known surfaces, no matter how they may have been wrought. The minute asperities on one surface are detained in corresponding hollows in the other, and consequently force must be exerted to make one surface slide upon the other. By care in polishing the surfaces the amount of friction may be diminished; but it can only be decreased to a certain limit, beyond which no amount of polishing seems to produce much difference.\n\n115. The law of friction under different conditions must be inquired into, in order that we may make allowance when its effect is of importance. The discussion of the experiments is sometimes a little difficult, and the truths arrived at are principally numerical, but we shall find that some interesting laws of nature will appear.\n\nTHE MODE OF EXPERIMENTING.\n116. Friction is present between every pair of surfaces which are in contact: there is friction between two pieces of wood, and between a piece of wood and a piece of iron; and the amount of the force depends upon the character of both surfaces. We shall only experiment upon the [Pg 67]friction of wood upon wood, as more will be learned by a careful study of a special case than by a less minute examination of a number of pairs of different substances.\n\n  117. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 32. A plank of pine 6' \u00d7 11\" \u00d7 2\" is planed on its upper surface, levelled by a spirit-level, and firmly secured to the framework at a height of about 4' from the ground. On it is a pine slide 9\" \u00d7 9\", the grain of which is crosswise to that of the plank; upon the slide the load a is placed. A rope is attached to the slide, which passes over a very freely mounted cast iron pulley c, 14\" diameter, and carries at the other end a hook weighing one pound, from which weights b can be suspended.\n\n118. The mode of experimenting consists in placing a certain load upon a, and then ascertaining what weight applied to b will draw the loaded slide along the plane. As several trials are generally necessary to determine the power, a rope is attached to the back of the slide, and passes over the two pulleys d; this makes it easy for the experimenter, when applying the weights at b, to draw back the slide to the end of the plane by pulling the ring e: this rope is of course left quite slack during the process of the experiment, since the slide must not be retarded. The loads placed upon a during the series of experiments ranged between one stone and eight stone. In the loads stated the weight of the slide itself, which was less than 1 lb., is always included. A variety of small weights were provided for the hook b; they consisted of 0\u00b71, 0\u00b75, 1, 2, 7, and 14 lbs. There is some friction to be overcome in the pulley c, but as the pulley is comparatively large its friction is small, though it was always allowed for.[Pg 68]\n\n\nFig. 32.\n\n119. An example of the experiments made is thus described. A weight of 56 lbs. is placed upon the slide, and it is found on trial that 29 lbs. on b (including the weight of the hook itself) is sufficient [Pg 69]to start the slide; this weight is placed upon the hook pound by pound, care being taken to make each addition gently.\n\n120. Experiments were made in this way with various weights upon a, and the results are recorded in Table I.\n\nTable I.\u2014Friction.\n\nSmooth horizontal surface of pine 72\" \u00d7 11\"; slide also of pine 9\" \u00d7 9\"; grain crosswise; slide is not started; force acting on slide is gradually increased until motion commences.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \t Load on slide\nin lbs.,\nincluding\nweight\nof slide\t Force necessary\nto move slide.\n1st Series.\t Force necessary\nto move slide.\n2nd Series.\tMean\n values.\n1\t14\t\u20075\t\u20078\t\u20076\u00b75\n2\t28\t15\t16\t15\u00b75\n3\t42\t20\t15\t17\u00b75\n4\t56\t29\t24\t26\u00b75\n5\t70\t33\t31\t32\u00b70\n6\t84\t43\t33\t38\u00b70\n7\t98\t42\t38\t40\u00b70\n8\t112\u2007\t50\t33\t41\u00b75\n\nIn the first column a number is given to each experiment for convenience of reference. In the second column the load on the slide is stated in lbs. In the third column is found the force necessary to overcome the friction. The fourth column records a second series of experiments performed in the same manner as the first series; while the last column shows the mean of the two frictions.\n\n121. The first remark to be made upon this table is, that the results do not appear satisfactory or concordant. Thus from 6 and 7 of the 1st series it would appear that the friction of 84 lbs. was 43 lbs., while that of 98 lbs. was 42 lbs., so that here the greater weight appears to have the less friction, which is evidently contrary to the whole tenor of the results, as a glance will show. Moreover the frictions in the [Pg 70]1st and the 2nd series do not agree, being generally greater in the former than in the latter, the discordance being especially noticeable in experiment 8, where the results were 50 lbs. and 33 lbs. In the final column of means these irregularities are lessened, for this column shows that the friction increases with the weight, but it is sufficient to observe that as the difference of the 1st and the 2nd is 9 lbs., and that of the 2nd and the 3rd is only 2 lbs., the discovery of any law from these results is hopeless.\n\n122. But is friction so capricious that it is amenable to no better law than these experiments appear to indicate? We must look a little more closely into the matter. When two pieces of wood have remained in contact and at rest for some time, a second force besides friction resists their separation: the wood is compressible, the surfaces become closely approximated, and the coherence due to this cause must be overcome before motion commences. The initial coherence is uncertain; it depends probably on a multitude of minute circumstances which it is impossible to estimate, and its presence has vitiated the results which we have found so unsatisfactory.\n\n123. We can remove these irregularities by starting the slide at the commencement. This may be conveniently effected by the screw shown at f in Fig. 32; a string attached to its end is fastened to the slide, and by giving the handle of the screw a few turns the slide begins to creep. A body once set in motion will continue to move with the same velocity unless acted upon by a force; hence the weight at b just overcomes the friction when the slide moves uniformly after receiving a start: this velocity was in one case of average speed measured to be 16 inches per minute.\n\n124. Indeed in no case can the slide commence to move unless the [Pg 71]force exceed the friction. The amount of this excess is indeterminate. It is certainly greater between wooden surfaces than between less compressible surfaces like those of metals or glass. In the latter case, when the force exceeds the friction by a small amount, the slide starts off with an excessively slow motion; with wood the force must exceed the friction by a larger amount before the slide commences to move, but the motion is then comparatively rapid.\n\n125. If the power be too small, the load either does not continue moving after the start, or it stops irregularly. If the power be too great, the load is drawn with an accelerated velocity. The correct amount is easily recognised by the uniformity of the movement, and even when the slide is heavily laden, a few tenths of a pound on the power hook cause an appreciable difference of velocity.\n\n126. The accuracy with which the friction can be measured may be appreciated by inspecting Table II.\n\nTable II.\u2014Friction.\n\nSmooth horizontal surface of pine 72\" \u00d7 11\"; slide also of pine 9\" \u00d7 9\"; grain crosswise; slide started; force applied is sufficient to maintain uniform motion of the slide.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \t Load on slide\nin lbs.,\nincluding\nweight\nof slide\t Force necessary to\nmaintain motion.\n1st Series.\t Force necessary to\nmaintain motion.\n2nd Series.\tMean\n values.\n1\t14\t\u20074\u00b79\t\u20074\u00b79\t\u20074\u00b79\n2\t28\t\u20078\u00b75\t\u20078\u00b76\t\u20078\u00b75\n3\t42\t12\u00b76\t12\u00b74\t12\u00b75\n4\t56\t16\u00b73\t16\u00b72\t16\u00b72\n5\t70\t19\u00b77\t20\u00b70\t19\u00b78\n6\t84\t23\u00b77\t23\u00b70\t23\u00b74\n7\t98\t26\u00b75\t26\u00b71\t26\u00b73\n8\t112\u2007\t29\u00b77\t29\u00b79\t29\u00b78\n\n[Pg 72]127. Two series of experiments to determine the power necessary to maintain the motion have been recorded. Thus, in experiment 7, the load on the slide being 98 lbs., it was found that 26\u00b75 lbs. was sufficient to sustain the motion, and a second trial being made independently, the power found was 26\u00b71 lbs.: a mean of the two values, 26\u00b73 lbs., is adopted as being near the truth. The greatest difference between the two series, amounting to 0\u00b77 lb., is found in experiment 6; a third value was therefore obtained for the friction of 84 lbs.: this amounted to 23\u00b75 lbs., which is intermediate between the two former results, and 23\u00b74 lbs., a mean of the three, is adopted as the final result.\n\n128. The close accordance of the experiments in this table shows that the means of the fifth column are probably very near the true values of the friction for the corresponding loads upon the slide.\n\n129. The mean frictions must, however, be slightly diminished before we can assert that they represent only the friction of the wood upon the wood. The pulley over which the rope passes turns round its axle with a small amount of friction, which must also be overcome by the power. The mode of estimating this amount, which in these experiments never exceeds 0\u00b75 lb., need not now be discussed. The corrected values of the friction are shown in the third column of Table III. Thus, for example, the 4\u00b79 lbs. of friction in experiment 1 consists of 4\u00b77, the true friction of the wood, and 0\u00b72, which is the friction of the pulley; and 26\u00b73 of experiment 7 is similarly composed of 25\u00b78 and 0\u00b75. It is the corrected frictions which will be employed in our subsequent calculations.\n\nFRICTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO\nTHE PRESSURE.\n130. Having ascertained the values of the force of friction for eight [Pg 73]different weights, we proceed to inquire into the laws which may be founded on our results. It is evident that the friction increases with the load, of which it is always greater than a fourth, and less than a third. It is natural to surmise that the friction (F) is really a constant fraction of the load (R)\u2014in other words, that F = kR, where k is a constant number.\n\n131. To test this supposition we must try to determine k; it may be ascertained by dividing any value of F by the corresponding value of R. If this be done, we shall find that each of the experiments yields a different quotient; the first gives 0\u00b7336, and the last 0\u00b7262, while the other experiments give results between these extreme values. These numbers are tolerably close together, but there is still sufficient discrepancy to show that it is not strictly true to assert that the friction is proportional to the load.\n\n  132. But the law that the friction varies proportionally to the pressure is so approximately true as to be sufficient for most practical purposes, and the question then arises, which of the different values of k shall we adopt? By a method which is described in the Appendix we can determine a value for k which, while it does not represent any one of the experiments precisely, yet represents them collectively better than it is possible for any other value to do. The number thus found is 0\u00b727. It is intermediate between the two values already stated to be extreme. The character of this result is determined by an inspection of Table III.\n\nThe fourth column of this table has been calculated from the formula F = 0\u00b727 R. Thus, for example, in experiment 5, the friction of a load of 70 lbs. is 19\u00b74 lbs., and the product of 70 and 0\u00b727 is 18\u00b79, which is 0\u00b75 lb. less than the true amount. In the last column of this table the discrepancies between the observed and the calculated values [Pg 74]are recorded, for facility of comparison. It will be observed that the greatest difference is under 1 lb.\n\nTable III.\u2014Friction.\n\nFriction of pine upon pine; the mean values of the friction given in Table II.

Hence the law F = 0\u00b727 R represents the experiments with tolerable accuracy; and the numerical ratio O\u00b727 is called the coefficient of friction. We may apply this law to ascertain the friction in any case where the load lies between 14 lbs. and 112 lbs.; for example, if the load be 63 lbs., the friction is 63 \u00d7 0\u00b727 = 17\u00b70.\n\n134. The coefficient of friction would have been slightly different had the grain of the slide been parallel to that of the plank; and it of course varies with the nature of the surfaces. Experimenters have given tables of the coefficients of friction of various substances, wood, stone, metals, &c. The use of these coefficients depends upon the assumption of the ordinary law of friction, namely, that the friction is proportional to the pressure: this law is accurate enough for most purposes, especially when used for loads that lie between the extreme weights employed in calculating the value of the coefficient which is employed.[Pg 75]\n\nA MORE ACCURATE LAW OF FRICTION.\n135. In making one of our measurements with care, it is unusual to have an error of more than a few tenths of 1 lb. and it is hardly possible that any of the mean frictions we have found should be in error to so great an extent as 0\u00b75 lb. But with the value of the coefficient of friction which is used in Table III., the discrepancies amount sometimes to 0\u00b79 lbs. With any other numerical coefficient than 0\u00b727, the discrepancies would have been even still more serious. As these are too great to be attributed to errors of experiment, we have to infer that the law of friction which has been assumed cannot be strictly true. The signs of the discrepancies indicate that the law gives frictions which for small loads are too small, and for large loads are too great.\n\n136. We are therefore led to inquire whether some other relation between F and R may not represent the experiments with greater fidelity than the common law of friction. If we diminished the coefficient by a small amount, and then added a constant quantity to the product of the coefficient and the load, the effect of this change would be that for small loads the calculated values would be increased, while for large loads they would be diminished. This is the kind of change which we have indicated to be necessary for reconciliation between the observed and calculated values.\n\n  137. We therefore infer that a relation of the form F = x + y R will probably express a more correct law, provided we can find x and y. One equation between x and y is obtained by introducing any value of R with the corresponding value of F, and a second equation can be found by taking any other similar pair. From these two equations the values of x and of y may be deduced by elementary algebra, but [Pg 76]the best formula will be obtained by combining together all the pairs of corresponding values. For this reason the method described in the Appendix must be used, which, as it is founded on all the experiments, must give a thoroughly representative result. The formula thus determined, is\n\nF = 1\u00b744 + 0\u00b7252 R.\n\nThis formula is compared with the experiments in Table IV.\n\nTable IV.\u2014Friction.\n\nFriction of pine upon pine; the mean values of the friction given in Table II.

It will be noticed that the greatest discrepancy in this column is 0\u00b74 lbs., and that therefore the formula represents the experiments with considerable accuracy. It is undoubtedly nearer the truth than the former law (Art. 132); in fact, the differences are now such as might really belong to errors unavoidable in making the experiments.[Pg 77]\n\n139. This formula may be used for calculating the friction for any load between 14 lbs. and 112 lbs. Thus, if the load be 63 lbs., the friction is 1\u00b744 + 0\u00b7252 \u00d7 63 = 17\u00b73 lbs., which does not differ much from 17\u00b70 lbs., the value found by the more ordinary law. We must, however, be cautious not to apply this formula to weights which do not lie between the limits of the greatest and least weight used in those experiments by which the numerical values in the formula have been determined; for example, to take an extreme case, if R = 0, the formula would indicate that the friction was 1\u00b744, which is evidently absurd; here the formula errs in excess, while if the load were very large it is certain the formula would err in defect.\n\nTHE COEFFICIENT VARIES WITH\nTHE WEIGHTS USED.\n140. In a subsequent lecture we shall employ as an inclined plane the plank we have been examining, and we shall require to use the knowledge of its friction which we are now acquiring. The weights which we shall then employ range from 7 lbs. to 56 lbs. Assuming the ordinary law of friction, we have found that 0\u00b727 is the best value of its coefficient when the loads range between 14 lbs. and 112 lbs. Suppose we only consider loads up to 56 lbs., we find that the coefficient 0\u00b7288 will best represent the experiments within this range, though for 112 lbs. it would give an error of nearly 3 lbs. The results calculated by the formula F = 0\u00b7288 R are shown in Table V., where the greatest difference is 0\u00b77 lb.[Pg 78]\n\nTable V.\u2014Friction.\n\nFriction of pine upon pine; the mean values of the friction given in Table II.

But we can replace the common law of friction by the more accurate law of Art. 137, and the formula computed so as to best harmonise the experiments up to 56 lbs., disregarding the higher loads, is F = 0\u00b79 + 0\u00b7266 R. This formula is obtained by the method referred to in Art. 137. We find that it represents the experiments better than that used in Table V. Between the limits named, this formula is also more accurate than that of Table IV. It is compared with the experiments in Table VI., and it will be noticed that it represents them with great precision, as no discrepancy exceeds 0\u00b71.\n\nTable VI.\u2014Friction.\n\nFriction of pine upon pine; the mean values of the friction given in Table II.

There is another mode of examining the action of friction besides that we have been considering. The apparatus for this purpose is shown in Fig. 33, in which b c represents the plank of pine we have already used. It is now mounted so as to be capable of turning about one end b; the end c is suspended from one hook of the chain from the \u201cepicycloidal\u201d pulley-block e. This block is very convenient for the purpose. By its means the inclination of the plank can be adjusted with the greatest nicety, as the raising chain g is held in one hand and the lowering chain f in the other. Another great convenience of this block is that the load does not run down when the lifting chain is left free. The plank is clamped to the hinge about which it turns. The frames by which both the hinge and the block are supported are weighted in order to secure steadiness. The inclination of the plane is easily ascertained by measuring the difference in height of its two ends above the floor, and then making a drawing on the proper scale. The starting-screw D, whose use has been already mentioned, is also fastened to the framework in the position shown in the figure.\n\n143. Suppose the slide a be weighted and placed upon the inclined plane b c; if the end C be only slightly elevated, the slide remains at rest; the reason being that the friction between the slide and the plane neutralizes the force of gravity. But suppose, by means of the pulley-block, c be gradually raised; an elevation is at last reached at which the slide starts off, and runs with an accelerating velocity to the bottom of the plane. The angle of elevation of the plane when this occurs is called the angle of statical friction.\n\n144. The weights with which the slide was laden in these experiments were 14 lbs., 56 lbs., and 112 lbs., and the results are given in Table VII.\n\nWe see that a load of 56 lbs. started when the plane reached an inclination of 20\u00b0\u00b71 in the first series, and of 17\u00b0\u00b72 in the second, the mean value 18\u00b0\u00b76 being given in the fifth column. These means for [Pg 81]the three different weights agree so closely that we assert the remarkable law that the angle of friction does not depend upon the magnitude of the load.\n\nTable VII.\u2014Angle of Statical Friction.\n\nA smooth plane of pine 72\" \u00d7 11\" carries a loaded slide of pine 9\" \u00d7 9\"; one end of the plane is gradually elevated until the slide starts off.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \t Total load on\nthe slide\nin lbs.\tAngle of\nelevation.\n 1st Series. \tAngle of\nelevation.\n 2nd Series. \t  Mean values\nof the\nangles.\n1\t14\t19\u00b0\u00b75\t\u2014\u2014\t19\u00b0\u00b75\n2\t56\t20\u00b0\u00b71\t17\u00b0\u00b72\t18\u00b0\u00b76\n3\t112\t20\u00b0\u00b73\t18\u00b0\u00b79\t19\u00b0\u00b76\n\n145. We might, however, proceed differently in determining the angle of friction, by giving the load a start, and ascertaining if the motion will continue. To do so requires the aid of an assistant, who will start the load with the help of the screw, while the elevation of the plane is being slowly increased. The result of these experiments is given in Table VIII.\n\nTable VIII.\u2014Angle of Friction.\n\nA smooth plane of pine 72\" \u00d7 11\" carries a loaded slide of pine 9\" \u00d7 9\"; one end of the plane is gradually elevated until the slide, having received a start, moves off uniformly.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \t Total load on\nslide in lbs.\tAngle of\n inclination.\n1\t14\t14\u00b0\u00b73\n2\t56\t13\u00b0\u00b70\n3\t112\t13\u00b0\u00b70\n\nWe see from this table also that the angle of friction is independent of the load, but the angle is in this case less by 5\u00b0 or 6\u00b0 than was found necessary to impart motion when a start was not given.[Pg 82]\n\n146. It is commonly stated that the coefficient of friction equals the tangent of the angle of friction, and this can be proved to be true when the ordinary law of friction is assumed. But as we have seen that the law of friction is only approximately correct, we need not expect to find this other law completely verified.\n\n  147. When the slide is started, the mean value of the angle of friction is 13\u00b0\u00b74. The tangent of this angle is 0\u00b724: this is about 11 per cent. less than the coefficient of friction 0\u00b727, which we have already determined. The mean value of the angle of friction when the slide is not started is 19\u00b0\u00b72, and its tangent is 0\u00b735. The experiments of Table I. are, as already pointed out, rather unsatisfactory, but we refer to them here to show that, so far as they go, the coefficient of friction is in no sense equal to the tangent of the angle of friction. If we adopt the mean values given in the last column of Table I., the best coefficient of friction which can be deduced is 0\u00b741. Whether, therefore, the slide be started or not started, the tangent of the angle of friction is smaller than the corresponding coefficient of friction. When the slide is started, the tangent is about 11 per cent. less than the coefficient; and when the slide is not started, it is about 14 per cent. less. There are doubtless many cases in which these differences are sufficiently small to be neglected, and in which, therefore, the law may be received as true.\n\nANOTHER LAW OF FRICTION.\n148. The area of the wooden slide is 9\" \u00d7 9\", but we would have found that the friction under a given load was practically the same whatever were the area of the slide, so long as its material remained unaltered. [Pg 83]This follows as a consequence of the approximate law that the friction is proportional to the pressure. Suppose that the weight were 100 lbs., and the area of the slide 100 inches, there would then be a pressure of 1 lb. per square inch over the surface of the slide, and therefore the friction to be overcome on each square inch would be 0\u00b727 lb., or for the whole slide 27 lbs. If, however, the slide had only an area of 50 square inches, the load would produce a pressure of 2 lbs., per square inch; the friction would therefore be 2 \u00d7 0\u00b727 = 0\u00b754 lb. for each square inch, and the total friction would be 50 \u00d7 0\u00b754 = 27 lbs., the same as before: hence the total friction is independent of the extent of surface. This would remain equally true even though the weight were not, as we have supposed, uniformly distributed over the surface of the slide.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\n149. The importance of friction in mechanics arises from its universal presence. We often recognize it as a destroyer or impeder of motion, as a waster of our energy, and as a source of loss or inconvenience. But, on the other hand, friction is often indirectly the means of producing motion, and of this we have a splendid example in the locomotive engine. The engine being very heavy, the wheels are pressed closely to the rails; there is friction enough to prevent the wheels slipping, consequently when the engines force the wheels to turn round they must roll onwards. The coefficient of friction of wrought iron upon wrought iron is about 0\u00b72. Suppose a locomotive weigh 30 tons, and the share of this weight borne by the driving wheels be 10 tons, the friction between the driving wheels and the rails is 2 tons. This is the greatest force the engine can exert on a level line. A force of 10 lbs. [Pg 84]for every ton weight of the train is known to be sufficient to sustain the motion, consequently the engine we have supposed should draw along the level a load of 448 tons.\n\n150. But we need not invoke the steam-engine to show the use of friction. We could not exist without it. In the first place we could not move about, for walking is only possible on account of the friction between the soles of our boots and the ground; nor if we were once in motion could we stop without coming into collision with some other object, or grasping something to hold on by. Objects could only be handled with difficulty, nails would not remain in wood, and screws would be equally useless. Buildings could hardly be erected, nay, even hills and mountains would gradually disappear, and finally dry land would be immersed beneath the level of the sea. Friction is, so far as we are concerned, quite as essential a law of nature as the law of gravitation. We must not seek to evade it in our mechanical discussions because it makes them a little more difficult. Friction obeys laws; its action is not vague or uncertain. When inconvenient it can be diminished, when useful it can be increased; and in our lectures on the mechanical powers, to which we now proceed, we shall have opportunities of describing machines which have been devised in obedience to its laws.[Pg 85]\n\nLECTURE VI.\nTHE PULLEY.\nIntroduction.\u2014Friction between a Rope and an Iron Bar.\u2014The use of the Pulley.\u2014Large and Small Pulleys.\u2014The Law of Friction in the Pulley.\u2014Wheels.\u2014Energy.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n151. The pulley forms a good introduction to the important subject of the mechanical powers. But before entering on the discussions of the next few chapters, it will be necessary for us to explain what is meant in mechanics by \u201cwork,\u201d and by \u201cenergy,\u201d which is the capacity for performing work, and we shall therefore include a short outline of this subject in the present lecture.\n\n152. The pulley is a machine which is employed for the purpose of changing the direction of a force. We frequently wish to apply a force in a different direction from that in which it is convenient to exert it, and the pulley enables us to do so. We are not now speaking of these arrangements for increasing power in which pulleys play an important part; these will be considered in the next lecture: we at present refer only to change of direction. In fact, as we shall shortly [Pg 86]see, some force is even wasted when the single fixed pulley is used, so that this machine certainly cannot be called a mechanical power.\n\n153. The occasions upon which a single fixed pulley is used are numerous and familiar. Let us suppose a sack of corn has to be elevated from the lower to one of the upper stories of a building. It may of course be raised by a man who carries it, but he has to lift his own weight in addition to that of the sack, and therefore the quantity of exertion used is greater than absolutely necessary. But supposing there be a pulley at the top of the building over which a rope passes; then, if a man attach one end of the rope to the sack and pull the other, he raises the sack without raising his own weight. The pulley has thus provided the means by which the downward force has been changed in direction to an upward force.\n\n154. The weights, ropes, and pulleys which are used in our windows for counterpoising the weight of the sash afford a very familiar instance of how a pulley changes the direction of a force. Here the downward force of the weight is changed by means of the pulley into an upward force, which nearly counterbalances the weight of the sash.\n\nFRICTION BETWEEN A ROPE AND\nAN IRON BAR.\n155. Every one is familiar with the ordinary form of the pulley; it consists of a wheel capable of turning freely on its axle, and it has a groove in its circumference in which the rope lies. But why is it necessary to give the pulley this form? Why could not the direction of the rope be changed by simply passing it over a bar, as well as by the more complicated pulley? We shall best answer this question by actually trying the experiment, which we can do by means of the apparatus of [Pg 87]Fig. 34 (see page 90). In this are shown two iron studs, g, h, 0\"\u00b76 diameter, and about 8\" apart; over these passes a rope, which has a hook at each end. If I suspend a weight of 14 lbs. from one hook a, and pull the hook b, I can by exerting sufficient force raise the weight on a, but with this arrangement I am conscious of having to exert a very much larger force than would have been necessary to raise 14 lbs. by merely lifting it.\n\n156. In order to study the question exactly, we shall ascertain what weight suspended from the hook b will suffice to raise a. I find that in order to raise 14 lbs. on a no less than 47 lbs. is necessary on b, consequently there is an enormous loss of force: more than two-thirds of the force which is exerted is expended uselessly. If instead of the 14 lbs. weight I substitute any other weight, I find the same result, viz. that more than three times its amount is necessary to raise it by means of the rope passing over the studs. If a labourer, in raising a sack, were to pass a rope over two bars such as these, then for every stone the sack weighed he would have to exert a force of more than three stones, and there would be a very extravagant loss of power.\n\n157. Whence arises this loss? The rope in moving slides over the surface of the iron studs. Although these are quite smooth and polished, yet when there is a strain on the rope it presses closely upon them, and there is a certain amount of force necessary to make the rope slide along the iron. In other words, when I am trying to raise up 14 lbs. with this contrivance, I not only have its weight opposed to me, but also another force due to the sliding of the rope on the iron: this force is due to friction. Were it not for friction, a force of 14 lbs. on one hook would exactly balance 14 lbs. on the other, and the slightest addition to either weight would make it descend and raise the other. If, then, we are obliged to change the direction of a force, we [Pg 88]must devise some means of doing so which does not require so great a sacrifice as the arrangement we have just used.\n\nTHE USE OF THE PULLEY.\n158. We shall next inquire how it is that we are enabled to obviate friction by means of a pulley. It is evident we must provide an arrangement in which the rope shall not be required to slide upon an iron surface. This end is attained by the pulley, of which we may take i, Fig. 34, as an example. This represents a cast iron wheel 14\" in diameter, with a V-shaped groove in its circumference to receive the rope: this wheel turns on a \u215d inch wrought iron axle, which is well oiled. The rope used is about 0\"\u00b725 in diameter.\n\n159. From the hooks e, f at each end of the rope a 14 lb. weight is suspended. These equal weights balance each other. According to our former experiment with the studs, it would be necessary for me to treble the weight on one of these hooks in order to raise the other, but now I find that an additional 0\u00b75 lb. placed on either hook causes it to descend and make the other ascend. This is a great improvement; 0\u00b75 lb. now accomplishes what 33 lbs. was before required for. We have avoided a great deal of friction, but we have not got rid of it altogether, for 0\u00b725 lb. is incompetent, when added to either weight, to make that weight descend.\n\n160. To what is the improvement due? When the weight descends the rope does not slide upon the wheel, but it causes the wheel to revolve with it, consequently there is little or no friction at the circumference of the pulley; the friction is transferred to the axle. We still have some resistance to overcome, but for smooth oiled iron axles the friction is very small, hence the advantage of the pulley.[Pg 89]\n\nThere is in every pulley a small loss of power from the force expended in bending the rope; this need not concern us at present, for with the pliable plaited rope that we have employed the effect is inappreciable, but with large strong ropes the loss becomes of importance. The amount of loss by using different kinds of ropes has been determined by careful experiments.\n\nLARGE AND SMALL PULLEYS.\n161. There is often a considerable advantage obtained by using large rather than small pulleys. The amount of force necessary to overcome friction varies inversely as the size of the pulley. We shall demonstrate this by actual experiment with the apparatus of Fig. 34. A small pulley k is attached to the large pulley i; they are in fact one piece, and turn together on the same axle. Hence if we first determine the friction with the rope over the large pulley, and then with the rope over the small pulley, any difference can only be due to the difference in size, as all the other circumstances are the same.\n\n162. In making the experiments we must attend to the following point. The pulleys and the socket on which they are mounted weigh several pounds, and consequently there is friction on the axle arising from the weight of the pulleys, quite independently of any weights that may be placed on the hooks. We must then, if possible, evade the friction of the pulley itself, so that the amount of friction which is observed will be entirely due to the weights raised. This can be easily done. The rope and hooks being on the large pulley i, I find that 0\u00b716 lb. attached to one of the hooks, e, is sufficient to overcome the friction of the pulley, and to make that hook descend and raise f. If therefore we leave 0\u00b716 lb. on e, [Pg 90]we may consider the friction due to the weight of the pulley, rope, and hooks as neutralized.\n\n\nFig. 34.\n\n163. I now place a stone weight on each of the hooks e and f. The amount necessary to make the hook e and its load descend is 0\u00b728 lb. This does not of course include the weight of 0\u00b716 lb. already referred to. We see therefore that with the large pulley the amount of friction to be overcome in raising one stone is 0\u00b728 lb.\n\n164. Let us now perform precisely the same experiment with the small [Pg 91]pulley. I transfer the same rope and hooks to k, and I find that 0\u00b716 lb. is not now sufficient to overcome the friction of the pulley, but I add on weights until c will just descend, which occurs when the load reaches 0\u00b795 lb. This weight is to be left on c as a counterpoise, for the reasons already pointed out. I place a stone weight on c and another on d, and you see that c will descend when it receives an additional load of 1\u00b735 lbs.; this is therefore the amount of friction to be overcome when a stone weight is raised over the pulley k.\n\n  165. Let us compare these results with the dimensions of the pulleys. The proper way to measure the effective circumference of a pulley when carrying a certain rope is to measure the length of that rope which will just embrace it. The length measured in this way will of course depend to a certain extent upon the size of the rope. I find that the circumferences of the two pulleys are 43\"\u00b70 and 9\"\u00b75. The ratio of these is 4\u00b75; the corresponding resistances from friction we have seen to be 0\u00b728 lb. and 1\u00b735 lbs. The larger of these quantities is 4\u00b78 times the smaller. This number is very close to 4\u00b75; we must not, as already explained, expect perfect accuracy in experiments in friction. In the present case the agreement is within the \u00b9/\u2081\u2086th of the whole, and we may regard it as a proof of the law that the friction of a pulley is inversely proportional to its circumference.\n\n166. It is easy to see the reason why friction should diminish when the size of the pulley is increased. The friction acts at the circumference of the axle about which the wheel turns; it is there present as a force tending to retard motion. Now the larger the wheel the greater will be the distance from the axis at which the force acts which overcomes the friction, and therefore the less need be the magnitude of the force. [Pg 92]You will perhaps understand this better after the principle of the lever has been discussed.\n\n167. We may deduce from these considerations the practical maxim that large pulleys are economical of power. This rule is well known to engineers; large pulleys should be used, not only for diminishing friction, but also to avoid loss of power by excessive bending of the rope. A rope is bent gradually around the circumference of a large pulley with far less force than is necessary to accommodate it to a smaller pulley: the rope also is apt to become injured by excessive bending. In coal pits the trucks laden with coal are hoisted to the surface by means of wire ropes which pass from the pit over a pulley into the engine-house: this pulley is of very large dimensions, for the reasons we have pointed out.\n\nTHE LAW OF FRICTION IN THE PULLEY.\n168. I have here a wooden pulley 3\"\u00b75 in diameter; the hole is lined with brass, and the pulley turns very freely on an iron spindle. I place the rope and hooks upon the groove. Brass rubbing on iron has but little friction, and when 7 lbs. is placed on each hook, 0\u00b75 lb. added to either will make it descend and raise up the other. Let 14 lbs. be placed on each hook, 0\u00b75 lb. is no longer sufficient; 1 lb. is required: hence when the weight is doubled the friction is also doubled. Repeating the experiment with 21 lbs. and 28 lbs. on each side, the corresponding weights necessary to overcome friction are 1\u00b75 lbs. and 2 lbs. In the four experiments the weights used are in the proportion 1, 2, 3, 4; and the forces necessary to overcome friction, 0\u00b75 lb., 1 lb., 1\u00b75 lbs., and 2 lbs., are in the same proportion. Hence the friction is proportional to the load.\n\nWHEELS.\n169. The wheel is one of the most simple and effective devices for [Pg 93]overcoming friction. A sleigh is an admirable vehicle on a smooth surface such as ice, but it is totally unadapted for use on common roads; the reason being that the amount of friction between the sleigh and the road is so great that to move the sleigh the horse would have to exert a force which would be very great compared with the load he was drawing. But a vehicle properly mounted on wheels moves with the greatest ease along the road, for the circumference of the wheel does not slide, and consequently there is no friction between the wheel and the road; the wheel however turns on its axle, therefore there is sliding, and consequently friction, at the axle, but the axle and the wheel are properly fitted to each other, and the surfaces are lubricated with oil, so that the friction is extremely small.\n\n170. With large wheels the amount of friction on the axle is less than with small wheels; other advantages of large wheels are that they do not sink much into depressions in the roads, and that they have also an increased facility in surmounting the innumerable small obstacles from which even the best road is not free.\n\n171. When it is desired to make a pulley turn with extremely small friction, its axle, instead of revolving in fixed bearings, is mounted upon what are called friction wheels. A set of friction wheels is shown in the apparatus of Fig. 66: as the axle revolves, the friction between the axles and the wheels causes the latter to turn round with a comparatively slow motion; thus all the friction is transferred to the axles of the four friction wheels; these revolve in their bearings with extreme slowness, and consequently the pulley is but little affected by friction. The amount of friction in a pulley so mounted may be understood from the following experiment. A silk cord is placed on the [Pg 94]pulley, and 1 lb. weight is attached to each of its ends: these of course balance. A number of fine wire hooks, each weighing 0\u00b7001 lb., are prepared, and it is found that when a weight of 0\u00b7004 lb. is attached to either side it is sufficient to overcome friction and set the weights in motion.\n\nENERGY.\n172. In connection with the subject of friction, and also as introductory to the mechanical powers, the notion of \u201cwork,\u201d or as it is more properly called \u201cenergy,\u201d is of great importance. The meaning of this word as employed in mechanics will require a little consideration.\n\n173. In ordinary language, whatever a man does that can cause fatigue, whether of body or mind, is called work. In mechanics, we mean by energy that particular kind of work which is directly or indirectly equivalent to raising weights.\n\n174. Suppose a weight is lying on the floor and a stool is standing beside it: if a man raise the weight and place it upon the stool, the exertion that he expends is energy in the sense in which the word is used in mechanics. The amount of exertion necessary to place the weight upon the stool depends upon two things, the magnitude of the weight and the height of the stool. It is clear that both these things must be taken into account, for although we know the weight which is raised, we cannot tell the amount of exertion that will be required until we know the height through which it is to be raised; and if we know the height, we cannot appreciate the quantity of exertion until we know the weight.\n\n175. The following plan has been adopted for expressing quantities of energy. The small amount of exertion necessary to raise 1 lb. [Pg 95]avoirdupois through one British foot is taken as a standard, compared with which all other quantities of energy are estimated. This quantity of exertion is called in mechanics the unit of energy, and sometimes also the \u201cfoot-pound.\u201d\n\n176. If a weight of 1 lb. has to be raised through a height of 2 feet, or a weight of 2 lbs. through a height of 1 foot, it will be necessary to expend twice as much energy as would have raised a weight of 1 lb. through 1 foot, that is, 2 foot-pounds.\n\nIf a weight of 5 lbs. had to be raised from the floor up to a stool 3 feet high, how many units of energy would be required? To raise 5 lbs. through 1 foot requires 5 foot-pounds, and the process must be again repeated twice before the weight arrive at the top of the stool. For the whole operation 15 foot-pounds will therefore be necessary.\n\nIf 100 lbs. be raised through 20 feet, 100 foot-pounds of energy is required for the first foot, the same for the second, third, &c., up to the twentieth, making a total of 2,000 foot-pounds.\n\nHere is a practical question for the sake of illustration. Which would it be preferable to hoist, by a rope passing over a single fixed pulley, a trunk weighing 40 lbs. to a height of 20 feet, or a trunk weighing 50 lbs. to a height of 15 feet? We shall find how much energy would be necessary in each case: 40 times 20 is 800; therefore in the first case the energy would be 800 foot-pounds. But 50 times 15 is 750; therefore the amount of work, in the second case, is only 750 lbs. Hence it is less exertion to carry 50 lbs. up 15 feet than 40 lbs. up 20 feet.\n\n177. The rate of working of every source of energy, whether it lie in the muscles of men or other animals, in water-wheels, steam-engines, or [Pg 96]other prime movers, is to be measured by the number of foot-pounds produced in the unit of time.\n\nThe power of a steam-engine is defined by its equivalent in horse-power. For example, it is meant that a steam-engine of 3 horse-power, could, when working for an hour, do as much work as 3 horses could do when working for the same time. The power of a horse is, however, an uncertain quantity, differing in different animals and not quite uniform in the same individual; accordingly the selection of this measure for the efficiency of the steam-engine is inconvenient. We replace it by a convenient standard horse-power, which is, however, a good deal larger than that continuously obtainable from any ordinary horse. A one horse-power steam-engine is capable of accomplishing 33,000 foot-pounds per minute.\n\n178. We shall illustrate the numerical calculation of horse-power by an example: if a mine be 1,000 feet deep, how much water per minute would a 50 horse-power engine be capable of raising to the surface? The engine would yield 50 \u00d7 33,000 units of work per minute, but the weight has to be raised 1,000 feet, consequently the number of pounds of water raised per minute is\n\n50 \u00d7 33,000\t = 1,650.\n1,000\n179. We shall apply the principle of work to the consideration of the pulley already described (p. 90). In order to raise the weight of 14 lbs., it is necessary that the rope to which the power is applied should be pulled downwards by a force of 15 lbs., the extra pound being on account of the friction. To fix our ideas, we shall suppose the 14 lbs. to be raised 1 foot; to lift this load directly, without the intervention of the pulley, 14 foot-pounds would be necessary, but when [Pg 97]it is raised by means of the pulley, 15, foot-pounds are necessary. Hence there is an absolute loss of \u00b9/\u2081\u2085th of the energy when the pulley is used. If a steam-engine of 1 horse-power were employed in raising weights by a rope passing over a pulley similar to that on which we have experimented, only \u00b9\u2074/\u2081\u2085ths of the work would be usefully employed; but we find\n\n33,000 \u00d7 14\t = 30,800.\n15\nThe engine would therefore perform 30,800 foot-pounds of useful work per minute.\n\n180. The effect of friction on a pulley, or on any other machine, is always to waste energy. To perform a piece of work directly requires a certain number of foot-pounds, while to do it by a machine requires more, on account of the loss by friction. This may at first sight appear somewhat paradoxical, as it is well known that, by levers, pulleys, &c., an enormous mechanical advantage may be gained. This subject will be fully explained in the next and following lectures, which relate to the mechanical powers.\n\n181. We shall conclude with a few observations on a point of the greatest importance. We have seen a case where 15 foot-pounds of energy only accomplished 14 foot-pounds of work, and thus 1 foot-pound appeared to be lost. We say that this was expended upon the friction; but what is the friction? The axle is gradually worn away by rubbing in its bearings, and, if it be not properly oiled, it becomes heated. The amount of energy that seems to disappear is partly expended in grinding down the axle, and is partly transformed into heat; it is thus not really lost, but unfortunately assumes a form which we do not require and in which it is rather injurious than otherwise. Indeed we know that [Pg 98]energy cannot be destroyed, however it may be transformed; if it disappear in one shape, it is only to reappear in another. A so-called loss of energy by friction only means a diversion of a part of the work to some purpose other than that which we wish to accomplish. It has long been known that matter is indestructible: it is now equally certain that the same may be asserted of energy.[Pg 99]\n\nLECTURE VII.\nTHE PULLEY-BLOCK.\nIntroduction.\u2014The Single Moveable Pulley.\u2014The Three-sheave Pulley-block.\u2014The Differential Pulley-block.\u2014The Epicycloidal Pulley-block.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n182. In the first lecture I showed how a large weight could be raised by a smaller weight, and I stated that this subject would again occupy our attention. I now fulfil this promise. The questions to be discussed involve the most advantageous methods of employing a small force to overcome a greater. Here is a subject of practical importance. A man of average strength cannot raise more than a hundredweight without great exertion, yet the weights which it is necessary to lift and move about often weigh many hundredweights, or even many tons. It is not always practicable to employ numerous hands for the purpose, nor is a steam-engine or other great source of power at all times available. But what are called the mechanical powers enable the forces at our disposal to be greatly increased. One man, by their aid, can exert as much force [Pg 100]as several could without such assistance; and when they are employed to augment the power of several men or of a steam-engine, gigantic weights, amounting sometimes to hundreds of tons, can be managed with facility.\n\n183. In the various arts we find innumerable cases where great resistances have to be overcome; we also find a corresponding number and variety of devices contrived by human skill to conquer them. The girders of an iron bridge have to be lifted up to their piers; the boilers and engines of an ocean steamer have to be placed in position; a great casting has to be raised from its mould; a railway locomotive has to be placed on the deck of a vessel for transit; a weighty anchor has to be lifted from the bottom of the sea; an iron plate has to be rolled or cut or punched: for all of these cases suitable arrangements must be devised in order that the requisite power may be obtained.\n\n184. We know but little of the means which the ancients employed in raising the vast stones of those buildings which travellers in the East have described to us. It is sometimes thought that a large number of men could have transported these stones without the aid of appliances which we would now use for a similar purpose. But it is more likely that some of the mechanical powers were used, as, with a multitude of men, it is difficult to ensure the proper application of their united strength. In Easter Island, hundreds of miles distant from civilised land, and now inhabited by savages, vast idols of stone have been found in the hills which must have been raised by human labour. It is useless to speculate on the extinct race by whom this work was achieved, or on the means they employed.\n\n185. The mechanical powers are usually enumerated as follows:\u2014The pulley, the lever, the wheel and axle, the wedge, the inclined plane, [Pg 101]the screw. These different powers are so frequently used in combination that the distinctions cannot be always maintained. The classification will, however, suffice to give a general notion of the subject.\n\n186. Many of the most valuable mechanical powers are machines in which ropes or chains play an important part. Pulleys are usually employed wherever it is necessary to change the direction of a rope or chain which is transmitting power. In the present lecture we shall examine the most important mechanical powers that are produced by the combination of pulleys.\n\nTHE SINGLE MOVEABLE PULLEY.\n187. We commence with the most simple case, that of the single moveable pulley (Fig. 35). The rope is firmly secured at one end a; it then passes down under the moveable pulley b, and upwards over a fixed pulley. To the free end, which depends from the fixed pulley, the power is applied while the load to be raised is suspended from the moveable pulley. We shall first study the relation between the power and the load in a simple way, and then we shall describe a few exact experiments.\n\n188. When the load is raised the moveable pulley itself must of course be also raised, and a part of the power is expended for this purpose. But we can eliminate the weight of the moveable pulley, so far as our calculations are concerned, by first attaching to the power end of the rope a sufficient weight to lift up the moveable pulley when not carrying a load. The weight necessary for doing this is found by trial to be a little over 1\u00b75 lbs. So that when a load is being raised we must reduce the apparent power by 1\u00b75 lbs. to obtain the power really effective.\n\n189. Let us suspend 14 lbs. from the load hook at b, and ascertain what power will raise the load. We leave the weight of the [Pg 102]moveable pulley and 1\u00b75 lbs. of the power at c out of consideration. I then find by experiment that 7 lbs. of effective power is not sufficient to raise the load, but if one pound more be added, the power descends, and the load is raised. Here, then, is a remarkable result; a weight of 8 lbs. has overcome 14 lbs. In this we have the first application of the mechanical powers to increase our available forces.\n\n\nFig. 35.\n\n190. Let us examine the reason of this mechanical advantage. If the load be raised one foot, it is plain that the power must descend two [Pg 103]feet: for in order to raise the load the two parts of the rope descending to the moveable pulley must each be shortened one foot, and this can only be done by the power descending two feet. Hence when the load of 14 lbs. is lifted by the machine, for every foot it is raised the power must descend two feet: this simple point leads to a conception of the greatest importance, on which depends the efficiency of the pulley. In the study of the mechanical powers it is essential to examine the number of feet through which the power must act in order to raise the load one foot: this number we shall always call the velocity ratio.\n\n191. To raise 14 lbs. one foot requires 14 foot-pounds of energy. Hence, were there no such thing as friction, 7 lbs. on the power hook would be sufficient to raise the load; because 7 lbs. descending through two feet yields 14 foot-pounds. But there is a loss of energy on account of friction, and a power of 7 lbs. is not sufficient: 8 lbs. are necessary. Eight lbs. in descending two feet performs 16 foot-pounds; of these only 14 are utilised on the load, the remainder being the quantity of energy that has been diverted by friction. We learn, then, that in the moveable pulley the quantity of energy employed is really greater than that which would lift the weight directly, but that the actual force which has to be exerted is less.\n\n192. Suppose that 28 lbs. be placed on the load hook, a few trials assure us that a power of 16 lbs. (but not less) will be sufficient for motion; that is to say, when the load is doubled, we find, as we might have expected, that the power must be doubled also. It is easily seen that the loss of energy by friction then amounts to 4 foot-pounds. We thus verify, in the case of the moveable pulley, the approximate law that the friction is proportional to the load.\n\n193. By means of a moveable pulley a man is able to raise a weight [Pg 104]nearly double as great as he could lift directly. From a series of careful experiments it has been found that when a man is employed in the particular exertion necessary for raising weights over a pulley, he is able to work most efficiently when the pull he is required to make is about 40 lbs. A man could, of course, exert greater force than this, but in an ordinary day\u2019s work he is able to perform more foot-pounds when the pull is 40 lbs. than when it is larger or smaller. If therefore the weights to be lifted amount to about 80 lbs., energy may really be economized by the use of the single moveable pulley, although by so doing a greater quantity of energy would be actually expended than would have been necessary to raise the weights directly.\n\n194. Some experiments on larger loads have been tried with the moveable pulley we have just described; the results are recorded in Table IX.\n\nTable IX.\u2014Single Moveable Pulley.\n\nMoveable pulley of cast iron 3\"\u00b725 diameter, groove 0\"\u00b76 wide, wrought iron axle 0\"\u00b76 diameter; fixed pulley of cast iron 5\" diameter, groove 0\"\u00b74 wide, wrought iron axle 0\"\u00b76 diameter, axles oiled; flexible plaited rope 0\"\u00b725 diameter; velocity ratio 2, mechanical efficiency 1\u00b78, useful effect 90 per cent.; formula P = 2\u00b721 + 0\u00b75453 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\n Load in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs..\tDiscrepancies\nbetween\nobserved and\n  calculated powers.\n1\t\u200728\t17\u00b75\t17\u00b75\t\u20070\u00b70\n2\t\u200757\t33\u00b75\t33\u00b73\t-0\u00b72\n3\t\u200785\t48\u00b75\t48\u00b76\t+0\u00b71\n4\t113\t64\u00b70\t63\u00b78\t-0\u00b72\n5\t142\t80\u00b70\t79\u00b76\t-0\u00b74\n6\t170\t94\u00b75\t94\u00b79\t+0\u00b74\n7\t198\t110\u00b75\u2007\t110\u00b72\u2007\t-0\u00b73\n8\t226\t125\u00b75\u2007\t125\u00b75\u2007\t\u20070\u00b70\n\nThe dimensions of the pulleys are precisely stated because, for pulleys [Pg 105]of different construction, the numerical coefficients would not necessarily be the same. An attentive study of this table will, however, show the general character of the relation between the power and the load in all arrangements of this class.\n\nThe table consists of five columns. The first contains merely the numbers of the experiments for convenience of reference. In the second column, headed R, the loads, expressed in pounds, which are raised in each experiment, are given; that is, the weight attached to the hook, not including the weight of the lower pulley. The weight of this pulley is not included in the stated loads. In the third column the powers are recorded, which were found to be sufficient to raise the corresponding loads in the second column. Thus, in experiment 7, it is found that a power of 110\u00b75 lbs. will be sufficient to raise a load of 198 lbs. The third column has thus been determined by gradually increasing the power until motion begins.\n\n195. From an examination of the columns showing the power and the load, we see that the power always amounts to more than half the load. The excess is partly due to a small portion of the power (about 1\u00b75 lbs.) being employed in raising the lower block, and partly to friction. For example, in experiment 7, if there had been no friction and if the lower block were without weight, a power of 99 lbs. would have been sufficient; but, owing to the presence of these disturbing causes, 110\u00b75 lbs. are necessary: of this amount 1\u00b75 lbs. is due to the weight of the pulley, 10 lbs. is the force of friction, and the remaining 99 lbs. raises the load.\n\n196. By a calculation based on this table we have ascertained a certain relation between the power and the load; they are connected by the formula which may be enunciated as follows:[Pg 106]\n\nThe power is found by multiplying the weight of the load into 0\u00b75453, and adding 2\u00b721 to the product. Calling P the power and R the load, we may express the relation thus: P = 2\u00b721 + 0\u00b75453 R. For example, in experiment 5, the product of 142 and 0\u00b75453 is 77\u00b743, to which, when 2\u00b721 is added, we find for P 79\u00b764, very nearly the same as 80 lbs., the observed value of the power.\n\nIn the fourth column the values of P calculated by means of this formula are given, and in the last we exhibit the discrepancies between the observed and the calculated values for the sake of comparison. It will be seen that the discrepancy in no case amounts to 0\u00b75 lb., consequently the formula expresses the experiments very well. The mode of deducing it is given in the Appendix.\n\n197. The quantity 2\u00b721 is partly that portion of the power expended in overcoming the weight of the moveable pulley, and partly arises from friction.\n\n198. We can readily calculate from the formula how much power will be required to raise a given weight; for example, suppose 200 lbs. be attached to the moveable pulley, we find that 111 lbs. must be applied as the power. But in order to raise 200 lbs. one foot, the power exerted must act over two feet; hence the number of foot-pounds required is 2 \u00d7 111 = 222. The quantity of energy that is lost is 22 foot-pounds. Out of every 222 foot-pounds applied, 200 are usefully employed; that is to say, about 90 per cent. of the applied energy is utilized, while the remaining 10 per cent. is lost by friction.\n\nTHE THREE-SHEAVE PULLEY-BLOCK.\n  199. The next arrangement we shall employ is a pair of pulley-blocks s t, Fig. 35, each containing three sheaves, as the small pulleys are termed. A rope is fastened to the upper block, s; it then passes down to the lower block t under one sheave, up again to the upper block and over a sheave, and so on, as [Pg 107]shown in the figure. To the end of the rope from the last of the upper sheaves the power h is applied, and the load g is suspended from the hook attached to the lower block. When the rope is pulled, it gradually raises the lower block; and to raise the load one foot, each of the six parts of the rope from the upper block to the lower block must be shortened one foot, and therefore the power must have pulled out six feet of rope. Hence, for every foot that the load is raised the power must have acted through six feet; that is to say, the velocity ratio is 6.\n\n200. If there were no friction, the power would only be one-sixth of the load. This follows at once from the principles already explained. Suppose the load be 60 lbs., then to raise it one foot would require 60 foot-pounds; and the power must therefore exert 60 foot-pounds; but the power moves over six feet, therefore a power of 10 lbs. would be sufficient. Owing, however, to friction, some energy is lost, and we must have recourse to experiment in order to test the real efficiency of the machine. The single moveable pulley nearly doubled our power; we shall prove that the three-sheave pulley-block will quadruple it. In this case we deal with larger weights, with reference to which we may leave the weight of the lower block out of consideration.\n\n201. Let us first attach 1 cwt. to the load hook; we find that 29 lbs. on the power hook is the smallest weight that can produce motion: this is only 1 lb. more than one-quarter of the load raised. If 2 cwt. be the load, we find that 56 lbs. will just raise it: this time the power is exactly one-quarter of the load. The experiment has been tried of placing 4 cwt. on the hook; it is then found that 109 lbs. will raise it, which is only 3 lbs. short of 1 cwt. These experiments demonstrate [Pg 108]that for a three-sheave pulley-block of this construction we may safely apply the rule, that the power is one-quarter of the load.\n\n202. We are thus enabled to see how much of our exertion in raising weights must be expended in merely overcoming friction, and how much may be utilized. Suppose for example that we have to raise a weight of 100 lbs. one foot by means of the pulley-block; the power we must apply is 25 lbs., and six feet of rope must be drawn out from between the pulleys: therefore the power exerts 150 foot-pounds of energy. Of these only 100 foot-pounds are usefully employed, and thus 50 foot-pounds, one-third of the whole, have been expended on friction. Here we see that notwithstanding a small force overcomes a large one, there is an actual loss of energy in the machine. The real advantage of course is that by the pulley-block I can raise a greater weight than I could move without assistance, but I do not create energy; I merely modify it, and lose by the process.\n\n203. The result of another series of experiments made with this pair of pulley-blocks is given in Table X.\n\nTable X.\u2014Three-Sheave Pulley-blocks.\n\nSheaves cast iron 2\"\u00b75 diameter; plaited rope 0\"\u00b725 diameter; velocity ratio 6; mechanical advantage 4; useful effect 67 per cent.; formula P = 2\u00b736 + 0\u00b7238 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\n Load in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs..\tDiscrepancies\nbetween\nobserved and\n  calculated powers.\n1\t\u200757\t15\u00b75\t15\u00b79\t+0\u00b74\n2\t114\t29\u00b75\t29\u00b75\t\u20070\u00b70\n3\t171\t43\u00b75\t43\u00b71\t-0\u00b74\n4\t228\t56\u00b70\t56\u00b76\t+0\u00b76\n5\t281\t70\u00b70\t69\u00b72\t-0\u00b78\n6\t338\t83\u00b70\t82\u00b78\t-0\u00b72\n7\t395\t97\u00b70\t96\u00b74\t-0\u00b76\n8\t452\t109\u00b70\u2007\t109\u00b79\u2007\t+0\u00b79\n\n[Pg 109]204. This table contains five columns; the weights raised (shown in the second column) range up to somewhat over 4 cwt. The observed values of the power are given in the third column; each of these is generally about one-quarter of the corresponding value of the load. There is, however, a more accurate rule for finding the power; it is as follows.\n\n205. To find the power necessary to raise a given load, multiply the loads in lbs. by 0\u00b7238, and add 2\u00b736 lbs. to the product. We may express the rule by the formula P = 2\u00b736 + 0\u00b7238 R.\n\n206. To find the power which would raise 228 lbs.; the product of 228 and 0\u00b7238 is 54\u00b726; adding 2\u00b736, we find 56\u00b76 lbs. for the power required; the actual observed power is 56 lbs., so that the rule is accurate to within about half a pound. In the fourth column will be found the values of P calculated by means of this rule. In the fifth column, the discrepancies between the observed and the calculated values of the powers are given, and it will be seen that the difference in no case reaches 1 lb. Of course it will be understood that this formula is only reliable for loads which lie between those employed in the first and last of the experiments. We can calculate the power for any load between 57 lbs. and 452 lbs., but for loads much larger than 452 or less than 57 it would probably be better to use the simple fourth of the load rather than the power computed by the formula.\n\n  207. I will next perform an experiment with the three-sheave pulley-block, which will give an insight into the exact amount of friction without calculation by the help of the velocity ratio. We first counterpoise the weight of the lower block by attaching weights to the power. It is found that about 1\u00b76 lbs. is sufficient for this purpose. I attach a 56 lb. weight as a load, and find that 13\u00b71 lbs. is [Pg 110]sufficient power for motion. This amount is partly composed of the force necessary to raise the load if there were no friction, and the rest is due to the friction. I next gradually remove the power weights: when I have taken off a pound, you see the power and the load balance each other; but when I have reduced the power so low as 5\u00b75 lbs. (not including the counterpoise for the lower block), the load is just able to overhaul the power, and run down. We have therefore proved that a power of 13\u00b71 lbs. or greater raises 56 lbs., that any power between 13\u00b71 lbs. and 5\u00b75 lbs. balances 56 lbs., and that any power less than 5\u00b75 lbs. is raised by 56 lbs.\n\nWhen the power is raised, the force of friction, together with the power, must be overcome by the load. Let us call X the real power that would be necessary to balance 56 lbs. in a perfectly frictionless machine, and Y the force of friction. We shall be able to determine X and Y by the experiments just performed. When the load is raised a power equal to X + Y must be applied, and therefore X + Y = 13\u00b71. On the other hand, when the power is raised, the force X is just sufficient to overcome both the friction Y and the weight 5\u00b75; therefore X = Y + 5\u00b75.\n\nSolving this pair of equations, we find that X = 9\u00b73 and Y = 3\u00b78. Hence we infer that the power in the frictionless machine would be 9\u00b73; but this is exactly what would have been deduced from the velocity ratio, for 56 \u00f7 6 = 9\u00b73 lbs. In this result we find a perfect accordance between theory and experiment.\n\nTHE DIFFERENTIAL PULLEY-BLOCK.\n208. By increasing the number of sheaves in a pair of pulley-blocks the power may be increased; but the length of rope (or chain) requisite for several sheaves becomes a practical inconvenience. There are also other [Pg 111]reasons which make the differential pulley-block, which we shall now consider, more convenient for many purposes than the common pulley blocks when a considerable augmentation of power is required.\n\n  209. The principle of the differential pulley is very ancient, and in modern times it has been embodied in a machine of practical utility. The object is to secure, that while the power moves over a considerable distance, the load shall only be raised a short distance. When this has been attained, we then know by the principle of energy that we have gained a mechanical advantage.\n\n210. Let us consider the means by which this is effected in that ingenious contrivance, Weston\u2019s differential pulley-block. The principle of this machine will be understood from Fig. 36 and Fig. 37.\n\n\nFig. 36.\n\nIt consists of three parts,\u2014an upper pulley-block, a moveable pulley, and an endless chain. We shall briefly describe them. The upper block p is furnished with a hook for attachment to a support. The sheave it contains resembles two sheaves, one a little smaller than the other, fastened together: they are in fact one piece. The grooves are provided with ridges, adapted to prevent the chain from slipping. The lower pulley q consists of one sheave, which is also furnished [Pg 112]with a groove; it carries a hook, to which the load is attached. The endless chain performs a part that will be understood from the sketch of the principle in Fig. 36. The chain passes from the hand at a up to l over the larger groove in the upper pulley, then downwards at b, under the lower pulley, up again at c, over the smaller groove in the upper pulley at a, and then back again by d to the hand at a. When the hand pulls the chain downwards, the two grooves of the upper pulley begin to turn together in the direction shown by the arrows on the chain. The large groove is therefore winding up the chain, while the smaller groove is lowering.\n\n211. In the pulley which has been employed in the experiments to be described, the effective circumference of the large groove is found to be 11\"\u00b784, while that of the small groove is 10\"\u00b736. When the upper pulley has made one revolution, the large groove must have drawn up 11\"\u00b784 of chain, since the chain cannot slip on account of the ridges; but in the same time the small groove has lowered 10\"\u00b736 of chain: hence when the upper pulley has revolved once, the chain between the two must have been shortened by the difference between 11\"\u00b784 and 10\"\u00b736, that is by 1\"\u00b748; but this can only have taken place by raising the moveable pulley through half 1\"\u00b748, that is, through a space 0\"\u00b774. The power has then acted through 11\"\u00b784, and has raised the resistance 0\"\u00b774. The power has therefore moved through a space 16 times greater than that through which the load moves. In fact, it is easy to verify by actual trial that the power must be moved through 16 feet in order that the load may be raised 1 foot. We express this by saying that the velocity ratio is 16.\n\n\nFig. 37.\n\n212. By applying power to the chain at d proceeding from the smaller groove, the chain is lowered by the large groove faster than it [Pg 113]is raised by the small one, and the lower pulley descends. The load is thus raised or lowered by simply pulling one chain a or the other d.\n\n  213. We shall next consider the mechanical efficiency of the differential pulley-block. The block (Fig. 37) which we shall use is intended to be worked by one man, and will raise any weight not exceeding a quarter of a ton.\n\nWe have already learned that with this block the power must act through sixteen feet for the load to be raised one foot. Hence, were it not for friction, the power need only be the sixteenth part of the load. A few trials will show us that the real efficiency is not so large, and that in fact more than half the work exerted is merely expended upon overcoming friction. This will lead afterwards to a result of considerable practical importance.\n\n214. Placing upon the load hook a weight of 200 lbs., I find that 38 lbs. attached to a hook fastened on the power chain is sufficient to raise the load; that is to say, the power is about one-sixth of the load. If I make the load 400 lbs. I find the requisite power to be 64 lbs., which is only about 3 lbs. less than one-sixth of 400 lbs. We may safely adopt the practical rule, that with this differential pulley-block a man would be able to raise a weight six times as great as he could raise without such assistance.\n\n215. A series of experiments carefully tried with different loads have given the results shown in Table XI.[Pg 114]\n\nTable XI.\u2014The Differential Pulley-block.\n\nCircumference of large groove 11\"\u00b784, of small groove 10\"\u00b736; velocity ratio 16; mechanical efficiency 6\u00b707; useful effect 38 per cent.; formula P = 3\u00b787 + 0\u00b71508 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\n Load in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs..\tDifferences of the\nobserved and\ncalculated powers.\n1\t\u200756\t10\t12\u00b73\t+2\u00b73\n2\t112\t20\t20\u00b78\t+0\u00b78\n3\t168\t31\t29\u00b72\t-1\u00b78\n4\t224\t38\t37\u00b77\t-0\u00b73\n5\t280\t48\t46\u00b71\t-1\u00b79\n6\t336\t54\t54\u00b76\t+0\u00b76\n7\t392\t64\t63\u00b71\t-0\u00b79\n8\t448\t72\t71\u00b75\t-0\u00b75\n9\t504\t80\t80\u00b70\t\u20070\u00b70\n10\u2007\t560\t86\t88\u00b74\t+2\u00b74\n\nThe first column contains the numbers of the experiments, the second the weights raised, the third the observed values of the corresponding powers. From these the following rule for finding the power has been obtained:\u2014\n\n216. To find the power, multiply the load by 0\u00b71508, and add 3\u00b787 lbs. to the product; this rule may be expressed by the formula P = 3\u00b787 + 0\u00b71508 R. (See Appendix.)\n\n217. The calculated values of the powers are given in the fourth column, and the differences between the observed and calculated values in the last column. The differences do not in any case amount to 2\u00b75 lbs., and considering that the loads raised are up to a quarter of a ton, the formula represents the experiments with satisfactory precision.\n\n218. Suppose for example 280 lbs. is to be raised; the product of 280 [Pg 115]and 0\u00b71508 is 42\u00b722, to which, when 3\u00b787 is added, we find 46\u00b709 to be the requisite power. The mechanical efficiency found by dividing 46\u00b709 into 280 is 6\u00b707.\n\n219. To raise 280 lbs. one foot 280 foot-pounds of energy would be necessary, but in the differential pulley-block 46\u00b709 lbs. must be exerted for a distance of 16 feet in order to accomplish this object. The product of 46\u00b709 and 16 is 737\u00b74. Hence the differential pulley-block requires 737\u00b74 foot-pounds of energy to be applied in order to yield 280 useful foot-pounds; but 280 is only 38 per cent. of 737\u00b74, and therefore with a load of 280 lbs. only 38 per cent. of the energy applied to a differential pulley-block is utilized. In general, we may state that not more than about 40 per cent. is profitably used, and that the remainder is expended in overcoming friction.\n\n220. It is a remarkable and useful property of the differential pulley, that a weight which has been hoisted will remain suspended when the hand is removed, even though the chain be not secured in any manner. The pulleys we have previously considered do not possess this convenient property. The weight raised by the three-sheave pulley-block, for example, will run down unless the free end of the rope be properly secured. The difference in this respect between these two mechanical powers is not a consequence of any special mechanism; it is simply caused by the excessive friction in the differential pulley-block.\n\n221. The reason why the load does not run down in the differential pulley may be thus explained. Let us suppose that a weight of 400 lbs. is to be raised one foot by the differential pulley-block; 400 units of work are necessary, and therefore 1,000 units of work must be applied [Pg 116]to the power chain to produce the 400 units (since only 40 per cent. is utilized). The friction will thus have consumed 600 units of work when the load has been raised one foot. If the power-weight be removed, the pressure supported by the upper pulley-block is diminished. In fact, since the power-weight is about \u00b9/\u2086th of the load, the pressure on the axle when the power-weight has been removed is only \u2076/\u2087ths of its previous value. The friction is nearly proportional to that pressure: hence when the power has been removed the friction on the upper axle is \u2076/\u2087ths of its previous value, while the friction on the lower pulley remains unaltered.\n\nWe may therefore assume that the total friction is at least \u2076/\u2087ths of what it was before the power-weight was removed. Will friction allow the load to descend? 600 foot-pounds of work were required to overcome the friction in the ascent: at least \u2076/\u2087 \u00d7 600 = 514 foot-pounds would be necessary to overcome friction in the descent. But where is this energy to come from? The load in its descent could only yield 400 units, and thus descent by the mere weight of the load is impossible. To enable the load to descend we have actually to aid the movement by pulling the chain d (Figs. 36 and 37), which proceeds from the small groove in the upper pulley.\n\n  222. The principle which we have here established extends to other mechanical powers, and may be stated generally. Whenever more than half the applied energy is consumed by friction, the load will remain without running down when the machine is left free.\n\nTHE EPICYCLOIDAL PULLEY-BLOCK.\n223. We shall conclude this lecture with some experiments upon a useful mechanical power introduced by Mr. Eade under the name of the [Pg 117]epicycloidal pulley-block. It is shown in Fig. 33, and also in Fig. 49. In this machine there are two chains: one a slight endless chain to which the power is applied; the other a stout chain which has a hook at each end, from either of which the load may be suspended. Each of these chains passes over a sheave in the block: these sheaves are connected by an ingenious piece of mechanism which we need not here describe. This mechanism is so contrived that, when the power causes the sheave to revolve over which the slight chain passes, the sheave which carries the large chain is also made to revolve, but very slowly.\n\n224. By actual trial it is ascertained that the power must be exerted through twelve feet and a half in order to raise the load one foot; the velocity ratio of the machine is therefore 12\u00b75.\n\n225. If the machine were frictionless, its mechanical efficiency would be of course equal to its velocity ratio; owing to the presence of friction the mechanical efficiency is less than the velocity ratio, and it will be necessary to make experiments to determine the exact value. I attach to the load hook a weight of 280 lbs., and insert a few small hooks into the links of the power chain in order to receive weights: 56 lbs. is sufficient to produce motion, hence the mechanical efficiency is 5. Had there been no friction a power of 56 lbs. would have been capable of overcoming a load of 12\u00b75 \u00d7 56 = 700 lbs. Thus 700 units of energy must be applied to the machine in order to perform 280 units of work. In other words, only 40 per cent. of the applied energy is utilized.\n\n226. An extended series of experiments upon the epicycloidal pulley-block is recorded in Table XII.[Pg 118]\n\nTable XII.\u2014The Epicycloidal Pulley-Block.\n\nSize adapted for lifting weights up to 5 cwt.; velocity ratio 12\u00b75; mechanical efficiency 5; useful effect 40 per cent.; calculated formula P = 5\u00b78 + 0\u00b7185 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\n Load in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs..\tDifferences of the\nobserved and\ncalculated powers.\n1\t\u200756\t15\t16\u00b72\t+1\u00b72\n2\t112\t27\t26\u00b75\t-0\u00b75\n3\t168\t40\t36\u00b79\t-3\u00b71\n4\t224\t47\t47\u00b72\t+0\u00b72\n5\t280\t56\t57\u00b76\t+1\u00b76\n6\t336\t66\t68\u00b70\t+2\u00b70\n7\t392\t78\t78\u00b73\t+0\u00b73\n8\t448\t88\t88\u00b76\t+0\u00b76\n9\t504\t100\u2007\t99\u00b70\t-1\u00b70\n10\u2007\t560\t110\u2007\t109\u00b74\u2007\t-0\u00b76\n\nThe fourth column shows the calculated values of the powers derived from the formula. It will be seen by the last column that the formula represents the experiments with but little error.\n\n227. Since 60 per cent. of energy is consumed by friction, this machine, like the differential pulley-block, sustains its load when the chains are free. The differential pulley-block gives a mechanical efficiency of 6, while the epicycloidal pulley-block has only a mechanical efficiency of 5, and so far the former machine has the advantage; on the other hand, that the epicycloidal pulley contains but one block, and that its lifting chain has two hooks, are practical conveniences strongly in its favour.[Pg 119]\n\nLECTURE VIII.\nTHE LEVER.\nThe Lever of the First Order.\u2014The Lever of the Second Order.\u2014The Shears.\u2014The Lever of the Third Order.\n\nTHE LEVER OF THE FIRST ORDER.\n228. There are many cases in which a machine for overcoming great resistance is necessary where pulleys would be quite inapplicable. To meet these various demands a correspondingly various number of contrivances has been devised. Amongst these the lever in several different forms holds an important place.\n\n229. The lever of the first order will be understood by reference to Fig. 38. It consists of a straight rod, to one end of which the power is applied by means of the weight c. At another point b the load is raised, while at a the rod is supported by what is called the fulcrum. In the case represented in the figure the rod is of iron, 1\" \u00d7 1\" in section and 6' long; it weighs 19 lbs. The power is produced by a 56 lb. weight: the fulcrum consists of a moderately sharp steel edge firmly secured to the framework. The load in [Pg 120]this case is replaced by a spring balance h, and the hook of the balance is attached to the frame. The spring is strained by the action of the lever, and the index records the magnitude of the force produced at the short end. This is the lever with which we shall commence our experiments.\n\n\nFig. 38.\n\n[Pg 121]230. In examining the relation between the power and the load, the question is a little complicated by the weight of the lever itself (19 lbs.), but we shall be able to evade the difficulty by means similar to those employed on a former occasion (Art. 60); we can counterpoise the weight of the iron bar. This is easily done by applying a hook to the middle of the bar at d, thence carrying a rope over a pulley f, and suspending a weight g of 19 lbs. from its free extremity. Thus the bar is balanced, and we may leave its weight out of consideration.\n\n  231. We might also adopt another plan analogous to that of Art. 51, which is however not so convenient. The weight of the bar produces a certain strain upon the spring balance. I may first read off the strain produced by the bar alone, and then apply the weight c and read again. The observed strain is due both to the weight c and to the weight of the bar. If I subtract the known effect of the bar, the remainder is the effect of c. It is, however, less complicated to counterpoise the bar, and then the strains indicated by the balance are entirely due to the power.\n\n232. The lever is 6' long; the point b is 6\" from the end, and b c is 5' long. b c is divided into 5 equal portions of 1'; a is at one of these divisions, 1' distant from b, and c is 5' distant from b in the figure; but c is capable of being placed at any position, by simply sliding its ring along the bar.\n\n233. The mode of experimenting is as follows:\u2014The weight is placed on the bar at the position c: a strain is immediately produced upon h; the spring stretches a little, and the bar becomes inclined. It may be noticed that the hook of the spring balance passes through the eye of a wire-strainer, so that by a few turns of the nut upon the strainer the lever can be restored to the horizontal position.[Pg 122]\n\n234. The power of 56 lbs. being 4' from the fulcrum, while the load is 1' from the fulcrum, it is found that the strain indicated by the balance is 224 lbs.; that is, four times the amount of the power. If the weight be moved, so as to be 3' from the fulcrum, the strain is observed to be 168 lbs.; and whatever be the distance of the power from the fulcrum, we find that the strain produced is obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the power in pounds by the distance expressed in feet, and fractional parts of a foot. This law may be expressed more generally by stating that the power is to the load as the distance of the load from the fulcrum is to the distance of the power from the fulcrum.\n\n235. We can verify this law under varied circumstances. I move the steel edge which forms the fulcrum of the lever until the edge is 2' from b, and secure it in that position. I place the weight c at a distance of 3' from the fulcrum. I now find that the strain on the balance is 84 lbs.; but 84 is to 56 as 3 is to 2, and therefore the law is also verified in this instance.\n\n  236. There is another aspect in which we may express the relation between the power and the load. The law in this form is thus stated: The power multiplied by its distance from the fulcrum is equal to the load multiplied by its distance from the fulcrum. Thus, in the case we have just considered, the product of 56 and 3 is 168, and this is equal to the product of 84 and 2. The distances from the fulcrum are commonly called the arms of the lever, and the rule is expressed by stating that The power multiplied into its arm is equal to the load multiplied into its arm: hence the load may be found by dividing the product of the power and the power arm by the load arm. This simple law gives a very convenient method of calculating the load, when we know the power and the distances of the power and the load from the fulcrum.[Pg 123]\n\n  237. When the power arm is longer than the load arm, the load is greater than the power; but when the power arm is shorter than the load arm, the power is greater than the load.\n\nWe may regard the strain on the balance as a power which supports the weight, just as we regard the weight to be a power producing the strain on the balance. We see, then, that for the lever of the first order to be efficient as a mechanical power it is necessary that the power arm be longer than the load arm.\n\n238. The lever is an extremely simple mechanical power; it has only one moving part. Friction produces but little effect upon it, so that the laws which we have given may be actually applied in practice, without making any allowance for friction. In this we notice a marked difference between the lever and the pulley-blocks already described.\n\n239. In the lever of the first order we find an excellent machine for augmenting power. A power of 14 lbs. can by its means overcome a resistance of a hundredweight, if the power be eight times as far from the fulcrum as the load is from the fulcrum. This principle it is which gives utility to the crowbar. The end of the bar is placed under a heavy stone, which it is required to raise; a support near that end serves as a fulcrum, and then a comparatively small force exerted at the power end will suffice to elevate the stone.\n\n240. The applications of the lever are innumerable. It is used not only for increasing power, but for modifying and transforming it in various ways. The lever is also used in weighing machines, the principles of which will be readily understood, for they are consequences of the law we have explained. Into these various appliances it is not our [Pg 124]intention to enter at present; the great majority of them may, when met with, be easily understood by the principle we have laid down.\n\nTHE LEVER OF THE SECOND ORDER.\n241. In the lever of the second order the power is at one end, the fulcrum at the other end, and the load lies between the two: this lever therefore differs from the lever of the first order, in which the fulcrum lies between the two forces. The relation between the power and the load in the lever of the second order may be studied by the arrangement in Fig. 39.\n\n242. The bar a c is the same rod of iron 72\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" which was used in the former experiment. The fulcrum a is a steel edge on which the bar rests; the power consists of a spring balance h, in the hook of which the end c of the bar rests; the spring balance is sustained by a wire-strainer, by turning the nut of which the bar may be adjusted horizontally. The part of the bar between the fulcrum a and the power c is divided into five portions, each 1' long, and the points a and c are each 6\" distant from the extremities of the bar. The load employed is 56 lbs.; through the ring of this weight the bar passes, and thus the bar supports the load. The bar is counterpoised by the weight of 19 lbs. at g, in the manner already explained (Art. 231).\n\n243. The mode of experimenting is as follows:\u2014Let the weight b be placed 1' from the fulcrum; the strain shown by the spring balance is about 11 lbs. If we calculate the value of the power by the rule already given, we should have found the same result. The product of the load by its distance from the fulcrum is 56, the distance of the power from the fulcrum is 5; hence the value of the power should be 56 \u00f7 5 = 11\u00b72.[Pg 125]\n\n\nFig. 39.\n\n244. If the weight be placed 2' from the fulcrum the strain is about 22\u00b75 lbs. and it is easy to ascertain that this is the same amount as would have been found by the application of the rule. A similar result would have been obtained if the 56 lb. weight had been placed upon any other part of the bar; and hence we may regard the rule proved for the [Pg 126]lever of the second order as well as for the lever of the first order: that, the power multiplied by its distance from the fulcrum is equal to the load multiplied by its distance from the fulcrum. In the present case the load is uniformly 56 lbs., while the power by which it is sustained is always less than 56 lbs.\n\n\nFig. 40.\n\n245. The lever of the second order is frequently applied to practical purposes; one of the most instructive of these applications is illustrated in the shears shown in Fig. 40.\n\nThe shears consist of two levers of the second order, which by their united action enable a man to exert a greatly increased force, sufficient, for example, to cut with ease a rod of iron 0\"\u00b725 square. The mode of action is simple. The first lever a f has a handle at one end f, which is 22\" distant from the other end [Pg 127]a, where the fulcrum is placed. At a point b on this lever, 1\"\u00b78 distant from the fulcrum a, a short link b c is attached; the end of the link c is jointed to a second lever c d; this second lever is 8\" long; it forms one edge of the cutting shears, the other edge being fixed to the framework.\n\n246. I place a rod of iron 0\"\u00b725 square between the jaws of the shears in the position e, the distance d e being 3\"\u00b75, and proceed to cut the iron by applying pressure to the handle. Let us calculate the amount by which the levers increase the power exerted upon f. Suppose for example that I press downwards on the handle with a force of 10 lbs., what is the magnitude of the pressure upon the piece of iron? The effect of each lever is to be calculated separately. We may ascertain the power exerted at b by the rule of moments already explained; the product of the power and its arm is 22 \u00d7 10 = 220; this divided by the number of inches, 1\u00b78 in the line a b, gives a quotient 122, and this quotient is the number of pounds pressure which is exerted by means of the link upon the second lever. We proceed in the same manner to find the magnitude of the pressure upon the iron at e. The product of 122 and 8 is 976. This is divided by 3\u00b75, and the quotient found is 279. Hence the exertion of a pressure of 10 lbs. at f produces a pressure of 279 lbs. at e. In round numbers, we may say that the pressure is magnified 28-fold by means of this combination of levers of the second order.\n\n247. A pressure of 10 lbs. is not sufficient to shear across the bar of iron, even though it be magnified to 279 lbs. I therefore suspend weights from f, and gradually increase the load until the bar is cut. I find at the first trial that 112 lbs. is sufficient, and a second trial with the same bar gives 114 lbs.; 113 lbs., the mean between these results, may be considered an adequate force. This is the [Pg 128]load on f; the real pressure on the bar is 113 \u00d7 27\u00b79 = 3153 lbs.: thus the actual pressure which was necessary to cut the bar amounted to more than a ton.\n\n  248. We can calculate from this experiment the amount of force necessary to shear across a bar one square inch in section. We may reasonably suppose that the necessary power is proportional to the section, and therefore the power will bear to 3153 lbs. the proportion which a square of one inch bears to the square of a quarter inch; but this ratio is 16: hence the force is 16 \u00d7 3153 lbs., equal to about 22\u00b75 tons.\n\n249. It is noticeable that 22\u00b75 tons is nearly the force which would suffice to tear the bar in sunder by actual tension. We shall subsequently return to the subject of shearing iron in the lecture upon Inertia (Lecture XVI.).\n\nTHE LEVER OF THE THIRD ORDER.\n250. The lever of the third order may be easily understood from Fig. 39, of which we have already made use. In the lever of the third order the fulcrum is at one end, the load is at the other end, while the power lies between the two. In this case, then, the power is represented by the 56 lb. weight, while the load is indicated by the spring balance. The power always exceeds the load, and consequently this lever is to be used where speed is to be gained instead of power. Thus, for example; when the power, 56 lbs., is 2' distant from the fulcrum, the load indicated by the spring balance is about 23 lbs.\n\n251. The treadle of a grindstone is often a lever of the third order. The fulcrum is at one end, the load is at the other end, and the foot has only to move through a small distance.[Pg 129]\n\n252. The principles which have been discussed in Lecture III. with respect to parallel forces explain the laws now laid down for levers of different orders, and will also enable us to express these laws more concisely.\n\n253. A comparison between Figs. 20 and 39 shows that the only difference between the contrivances is that in Fig. 20 we have a spring balance c in the same place as the steel edge a in Fig 39. We may in Fig. 20 regard one spring balance as the power, the other as the fulcrum, and the weight as the load. Nor is there any essential difference between the apparatus of Fig. 38 and that of Fig. 20. In Fig. 38 the bar is pulled down by a force at each end, one a weight, the other a spring balance, while it is supported by the upward pressure of the steel edge. In Fig. 20 the bar is being pulled upwards by a force at each end, and downwards by the weight. The two cases are substantially the same. In each of them we find a bar acted upon by a pair of parallel forces applied at its extremities, and retained in equilibrium by a third force.\n\n254. We may therefore apply to the lever the principles of parallel forces already explained. We showed that two parallel forces acting upon a bar could be compounded into a resultant, applied at a certain point of the bar. We have defined the moment of a force (Art. 64), and proved that the moments of two parallel forces about the point of application of their resultant are equal.\n\n255. In the lever of the first order there are two parallel forces, one at each end; these are compounded into a resultant, and it is necessary that this resultant be applied exactly over the steel edge or fulcrum in order that the bar may be maintained at rest. In the levers of the second and third orders, the power and the load are two parallel forces acting in opposite directions; their resultant, therefore, does not lie [Pg 130]between the forces, but is applied on the side of the greater, and at the point where the steel edge supports the bar. In all cases the moment of one of the forces about the fulcrum must be equal to that of the other. From the equality of moments it follows that the product of the power and the distance of the power from the fulcrum equals the product of the load, and the distance of the load from the fulcrum: this principle suffices to demonstrate the rules already given.\n\n256. The laws governing the lever may be deduced from the principle of work; the load, if nearer than the power to the fulcrum, is moved through a smaller distance than the power. Thus, for example, in the lever of the first order: if the load be 12 times as far as the power from the fulcrum, then for every inch the load moves it can be demonstrated that the power must move 12 inches. The number of units of work applied at one end of a machine is equal to the number yielded at the other, always excepting the loss due to friction, which is, however, so small in the lever that we may neglect it. If then a power of 1 lb. be applied to move the power end through 12 inches, one unit of work will have been put into the machine. Hence one unit of work must be done on the load, but the load only moves through \u00b9/\u2081\u2082 of a foot, and therefore a load of 12 lbs. could be overcome: this is the same result as would be given by the rule (Art. 236).\n\n257. To conclude: we have first determined by actual experiment the relation between the power and the load in the lever; we have seen that the law thus obtained harmonizes with the principle of the composition of parallel forces; and, finally, we have shown how the same result can be deduced from the fertile and important principle of work.[Pg 131]\n\nLECTURE IX.\nTHE INCLINED PLANE AND THE SCREW.\nThe Inclined Plane without Friction.\u2014The Inclined Plane with Friction.\u2014The Screw.\u2014The Screw-jack.\u2014The Bolt and Nut.\n\nTHE INCLINED PLANE WITHOUT FRICTION.\n258. The mechanical powers now to be considered are often used for other purposes beside those of raising great weights. For example: the parts of a structure have to be forcibly drawn together, a powerful compression has to be exerted, a mass of timber or other material has to be riven asunder by splitting. For purposes of this kind the inclined plane in its various forms, and the screw, are of the greatest use. The screw also, in the form of the screw-jack, is sometimes used in raising weights. It is principally convenient when the weight is enormously great, and the distance through which it has to be raised comparatively small.\n\n\nFig. 41.\n\n259. We shall commence with the study of the inclined plane. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 41. a b is a plate of glass 4' [Pg 132]long, mounted on a frame and turning round a hinge at a; b d is a circular arc, with its centre at a, by which the glass may be supported; d c is a vertical rod, to which the pulley c is clamped. This pulley can be moved up and down, to be accommodated to the position of a b; the pulley is made of brass, and turns very freely. A little truck r is adapted to run on the plane of glass. The truck is laden to weigh 1 lb., and this weight is unaltered throughout the experiments; the wheels are very free, so that the truck runs with but little friction.\n\n260. But the friction, though small, is appreciable, and it will be necessary to measure the amount and then endeavour to counteract its effect upon the motion. The silk cord attached to the truck is very fine, and its weight is neglected. A series of weights is provided; they are made from pieces of brass wire, and weigh 0\u00b71 lb. and 0\u00b701 lb.: these can easily be hooked into the loop on the cord at p. We first make the plane a b horizontal, and bring down the pulley c so that the cord shall be parallel to the plane; we find that a force must be applied by the cord in order to draw the truck along the plane: this force is of course the friction, and by a suitable weight at p the friction may be said to be counterbalanced. But we cannot expect that the friction will be the same when the plane is horizontal as when the plane is inclined. We must therefore examine this question by a method analogous to that used in Art. 207.\n\n261. Let the plane be elevated until b e, the elevation of b above a d, is 20\"; let c be properly adjusted: it is found that when p is O\u00b745 lb. r is [Pg 133]just pulled up; and on the other hand, when p is only 0\u00b740 lb. the truck descends and raises p; and when p has any value intermediate between these two, the truck remains in equilibrium. Let us denote the force of gravity acting down the plane by r, and it follows that r must be 0\u00b7425 lb., and the friction 0\u00b7025 lb. For when p raises r, it must overcome friction as well as r; therefore the power must be 0\u00b7025 + 0\u00b7425 = 0\u00b745. On the other hand, when r raises p, it must also overcome the friction 0\u00b7025, therefore p can only be 0\u00b7425 - 0\u00b7025 = 0\u00b740; and r is thus found to be a mean between the greatest and least values of p consistent with equilibrium. If the plane be raised so that the height b e is 33\", the greatest and least values of p are 0\u00b766 and 0\u00b771; therefore r is 0\u00b7685 friction 0\u00b7025, the same as before. Finally, making the height b e only 2\", the friction is found to be 0\u00b7020, which is not much less than the previous determinations. These experiments show that we may consider this very small friction to be practically constant at these inclinations. (Were the friction large, other methods are necessary, see Art. 265.) As in the experiments r is always raised we shall give p the permanent load of 0\u00b7025 lb., thus sufficiently counteracting friction, which we may therefore dismiss from consideration. It is hardly necessary to remark that, in afterwards recording the weights placed at p, this counterpoise is not to be included.\n\n262. We have now the means of studying the relation between the power and the load in the frictionless inclined plane. The incline being set at different elevations, we shall observe the force necessary to draw up the constant load of 1 lb. Our course will be guided by first making use of the principle of energy. Suppose b e to be 2'; when the truck has been moved from the bottom of the plane to the top, it will [Pg 134]have been raised vertically through a height of 2', and two units of energy must have been consumed. But the plane being 4' long, the force which draws up the truck need only be 0\u00b75 lb., for 0\u00b75 lb. acting over 4' produces two units of work. In general, if l be the length of the plane and h its height, R the load, and P the power, the number of units of energy necessary to raise the load is R h, and the number of units expended in pulling it up the plane is P l: hence R h = P l, and consequently P : h :: R : l; that is, the power is to the height of the plane as the load is to its length. In the present case R = 1 lb., l = 48\"; therefore P = 0\u00b70208 h, where h is the height of the plane in inches, and P the power in pounds.\n\n263. We compare the powers calculated by this formula with the actual observed values: the result is given in Table XIII.\n\nTable XIII.\u2014Inclined Plane.\n\nGlass Plane 48\" long, truck 1 lb. in weight, friction counterpoised; formula P = 0\u00b70208 \u00d7 h\".\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tHeight\nof plane.\t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifferences of the\nobserved and\ncalculated powers.\n1\t\u20072\"\t0\u00b704\t0\u00b704\t0\u00b700\n2\t\u20074\"\t0\u00b708\t0\u00b708\t0\u00b700\n3\t\u20076\"\t0\u00b713\t0\u00b712\t-0\u00b701\n4\t\u20078\"\t0\u00b716\t0\u00b717\t+0\u00b701\n5\t10\"\t0\u00b721\t0\u00b721\t0\u00b700\n6\t15\"\t0\u00b731\t0\u00b731\t0\u00b700\n7\t20\"\t0\u00b742\t0\u00b742\t0\u00b700\n8\t33\"\t0\u00b771\t0\u00b769\t-0\u00b702\n\nThus for example, in experiment 6, where the height b e is 15\", it is observed that the power necessary to draw the truck is 0\u00b731 lb. The truck is placed in the middle of the plane, and the power is [Pg 135]adjusted so as to be sufficient to draw the truck to the top with certainty; the necessary power calculated by the formula is also 0\u00b731 lbs., so that the theory is verified.\n\n264. The fifth column of the table shows the difference between the observed and the calculated powers. The very slight differences, in no case exceeding the fiftieth part of a pound, may be referred to the inevitable errors of experiment.\n\nTHE INCLINED PLANE WITH FRICTION.\n  265. The friction of the truck upon the glass plate is always very small, and is shown to have but little variation at those inclinations of the plane which we used. But when the friction is large, we shall not be justified in neglecting its changes at different elevations, and we must adopt more rigorous methods. For this inquiry we shall use the pine plank and slide already described in Art. 117. We do not in this case attempt to diminish friction by the aid of wheels, and consequently it will be of considerable amount.\n\n266. In another respect the experiments of Table XIII. are also in contrast with those now to be described. In the former the load was constant, while the elevation was changed. In the latter the elevation remains constant while a succession of different loads are tried. We shall find in this inquiry also that when the proper allowance has been made for friction, the theoretical law connecting the power and the load is fully verified.\n\n267. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 33; the plane, is, however, secured at one inclination, and the pulley c shown in Fig. 32 is adjusted to the apparatus, so that the rope from the pulley to the slide is parallel to the incline. The elevation of the plane in the [Pg 136]position adopted is 17\u00b0\u00b72, so that its length, base, and height are in the proportions of the numbers 1, 0\u00b7955, and 0\u00b7296. Weights ranging from 7 lbs. to 56 lbs. are placed upon the slide, and the power is found which, when the slide is started by the screw, will draw it steadily up the plane. The requisite power consists of two parts, that which is necessary to overcome gravity acting down the plane, and that which is necessary to overcome friction.\n\n\nFig. 42.\n\n268. The forces are shown in Fig. 42. r g, the force of gravity, is resolved into r l and r m; r l is evidently the component acting down the plane, and r m the pressure against the plane; the triangle g l r is similar to a b c, hence if r be the load, the force r l acting down the plane must be 0\u00b7296 r, and the pressure upon the plane 0\u00b7955 r.\n\n269. We shall first make a calculation with the ordinary law that the friction is proportional to the pressure. The pressure upon the plane a b, to which the friction is proportional, is not the weight of the load. The pressure is that component (r m) of the load which is perpendicular to the plane a b. When the weights do not extend beyond 56 lbs., the best value for the coefficient of friction is 0\u00b7288 (Art. 141): hence the amount of friction upon the plane is\n\n0\u00b7288 \u00d7 0\u00b7955 R = 0\u00b7275 R.\n\nThis force must be overcome in addition to 0\u00b7296 R (the component of gravity acting down the plane): hence the expression for the power is\n\n0\u00b7275 R + 0\u00b7296 R = 0\u00b7571 R.\n\n[Pg 137]270. The values of the observed powers compared with the powers calculated from the expression 0\u00b7571 R are shown in Table XIV.\n\nTable XIV.\u2014Inclined Plane.\n\nSmooth plane of pine 72\" \u00d7 11\"; angle of inclination 17\u00b0\u00b72; slide of pine, grain crosswise; slide started; formula P = 0\u00b7571 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\n Total load\non slide\nin lbs.\tPower\nin lbs.\nwhich just\n draws up slide. \tP.\nCalculated\nvalue of\n the power. \tDifferences of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t\u20077\t\u20074\u00b76\t\u20074\u00b70\t-0\u00b76\n2\t14\t\u20078\u00b73\t\u20078\u00b70\t-0\u00b73\n3\t21\t12\u00b73\t12\u00b70\t-0\u00b73\n4\t28\t16\u00b75\t16\u00b70\t-0\u00b75\n5\t35\t20\u00b70\t20\u00b70\t\u20070\u00b70\n6\t42\t24\u00b72\t24\u00b70\t-0\u00b72\n7\t49\t28\u00b70\t28\u00b70\t\u20070\u00b70\n8\t56\t31\u00b78\t32\u00b70\t+0\u00b72\n\n271. Thus for example, in experiment 6, a load of 42 lbs. was raised by a force of 24\u00b72 lbs., while the calculated value is 24\u00b70 lbs.; the difference, 0\u00b72 lbs., is shown in the last column.\n\n272. The calculated values are found to agree tolerably well with the observed values, but the presence of the large differences in No. 1 and No. 4 leads us to inquire whether by employing the more accurate law of friction (Art. 141) a better result may not be obtained.\n\nIn Table VI. we have shown that the friction for weights not exceeding 56 lbs. is expressed by the formula F = 0\u00b79 + 0\u00b7266 \u00d7 pressure, but the pressure is in this case = 0\u00b7955 R, and hence the friction is\n\n0\u00b79 + 0\u00b7254 R.\n\nTo this must be added 0\u00b7296 R, the component of the force of [Pg 138]gravity which must be overcome, and hence the total force necessary is\n\n0\u00b79 + 0\u00b755 R.\n\nThe powers calculated from this expression are compared with those actually observed in Table XV.\n\nTable XV.\u2014Inclined Plane.\n\nSmooth plane of pine 72\"\u00d7 11\"; angle of inclination 17\u00b0\u00b72; slide of pine, grain crosswise; slide started; formula P = 0\u00b79 + 0\u00b755 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\n Total load\non slide\nin lbs.\tPower\nin lbs.\nwhich just\n draws up slide. \tP.\nCalculated\nvalue of\n the power. \tDifferences of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t\u20077\t\u20074\u00b76\t\u20074\u00b77\t+0\u00b71\n2\t14\t\u20078\u00b73\t\u20078\u00b76\t+0\u00b73\n3\t21\t12\u00b73\t12\u00b75\t+0\u00b72\n4\t28\t16\u00b75\t16\u00b73\t-0\u00b72\n5\t35\t20\u00b70\t20\u00b71\t+0\u00b71\n6\t42\t24\u00b72\t24\u00b70\t-0\u00b72\n7\t49\t28\u00b70\t27\u00b78\t-0\u00b72\n8\t56\t31\u00b78\t31\u00b77\t-0\u00b71\n\nFor example: in experiment 5, a load of 35 lbs. is found to be raised by a power of 20\u00b70 lbs., while the calculated power is 0\u00b79 + 0\u00b755 \u00d7 35 = 20\u00b71 lbs.\n\n273. The calculated values of the powers are shown by this table to agree extremely well with the observed values, the greatest difference being only O\u00b73 lb. Hence there can be no doubt that the principles on which the formula has been calculated are correct. This table may therefore be regarded as verifying both the law of friction, and the rule laid down for the relation between the power and the load in the inclined plane.\n\n274. The inclined plane is properly styled a mechanical power. For let the weight be 30 lbs., we calculate by the formula that 17\u00b74 lbs. would [Pg 139]be sufficient to raise it, so that, notwithstanding the loss by friction, we have here a smaller force overcoming a larger one, which is the essential feature of a mechanical power. The mechanical efficiency is 30 \u00f7 17\u00b74 = 1\u00b772.\n\n275. The velocity ratio in the inclined plane is the ratio of the distance through which the power moves to the height through which the weight is raised, that is 1 \u00f7 0\u00b7296 = 3\u00b738. To raise 30 lbs. one foot, a force of 17\u00b74 lbs. must therefore be exerted through 3\u00b738 feet. The number of units of work expended is thus 17\u00b74 \u00d7 3\u00b738 = 58\u00b78. Of this 30 units, equivalent to 51 per cent., are utilized. The remaining 28\u00b78 units, or 49 per cent., are absorbed by friction.\n\n276. We have pointed out in Art. 222 that a machine in which less than half the energy is lost by friction will permit the load to run down when free: this is the case in the present instance; hence the weight will run down the plane unless specially restrained. That it should do so agrees with Art. 147, for it was there shown that at about 13\u00b0\u00b74, and still more at any greater inclination, the slide would descend when started.\n\nTHE SCREW.\n  277. The inclined plane as a mechanical power is often used in the form of a wedge or in the still more disguised form of a screw. A wedge is an inclined plane which is forced under the load; it is usually moved by means of a hammer, so that the efficiency of the wedge is augmented by the dynamical effect of a blow.\n\n278. The screw is one of the most useful mechanical powers which we possess. Its form may be traced by wrapping a wedge-shaped piece of paper around a cylinder, and then cutting a groove in the cylinder along the spiral line indicated by the margin of the paper. Such a [Pg 140]groove is a screw. In order that the screw may be used it must revolve in a nut which is made from a hollow cylinder, the internal diameter of which is equal to that of the cylinder from which the screw is cut. The nut contains a spiral ridge, which fits into the corresponding thread in the screw; when the nut is turned round, it moves backwards or forwards according to the direction of the rotation. Large screws of the better class, such as those upon which we shall first make experiments, are always turned in a lathe, and are thus formed with extreme accuracy. Small screws are made in a simpler manner by means of dies and other contrivances.\n\n279. A characteristic feature of a screw is the inclination of the thread to the axis. This is most conveniently described by the number of complete turns which the thread makes in a specified length of the screw, usually an inch. For example: a screw is said to have ten threads to the inch when it requires 10 revolutions of the nut in order to move it one inch. The shape of the thread itself varies with the purposes for which the screw is intended; the section may be square or triangular, or, as is generally the case in small screws, of a rounded form.\n\n280. There is so much friction in the screw that experiments are necessary for the determination of the law connecting the power and the load.\n\n281. We shall commence with an examination of the screw by the apparatus shown in Fig. 43.\n\nThe nut a is secured upon a stout frame; to the end of the screw hooks are attached, in order to receive the load, which in this apparatus does not exceed 224 lbs.; at the top of the screw is an arm e by which the screw is turned; to the end of the arm a rope is attached, which passing over a pulley d, carries a hook for receiving the power c.[Pg 141]\n\n\nFig. 43.\n\n282. We first apply the principle of work to this screw, and calculate the relation between the power and the load as it would be found if friction were absent. The diameter of the circle described by the end of the arm is 20\"\u00b75; its circumference is therefore 64\"\u00b74. The screw contains three threads in the inch, hence in order to raise the load 1\" the power moves 3 \u00d7 64\"\u00b74 = 193\" very nearly; therefore the velocity ratio is 193, and were the screw capable of working without friction, 193 would represent the mechanical efficiency. In actually performing the experiments the arm E is placed at right angles to the rope leading to the pulley, and the power hook is weighted until, with [Pg 142]a slight start, the arm is steadily drawn; but the power will only move the arm a few inches, for when the cord ceases to be perpendicular to the arm the power acts with diminished efficiency; consequently the load is only raised in each experiment through a small fraction of an inch, but quite sufficient for our purpose.\n\nTable XVI.\u2014The Screw.\n\nWrought iron screw, square thread, diameter 1\"\u00b725, with 3 threads to the inch, length of arm 10\"\u00b725; nut of cast iron, bearing surfaces oiled, velocity ratio 193, useful effect 36 per cent., mechanical efficiency 70; formula P = 0\u00b70143 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\nLoad\n in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifference of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t\u200728\t0\u00b74\t0\u00b74\t0\u00b70\n2\t\u200756\t0\u00b78\t0\u00b78\t0\u00b70\n3\t\u200784\t1\u00b72\t1\u00b72\t0\u00b70\n4\t112\t1\u00b76\t1\u00b76\t0\u00b70\n5\t140\t2\u00b70\t2\u00b70\t0\u00b70\n6\t168\t2\u00b74\t2\u00b74\t0\u00b70\n7\t196\t2\u00b77\t2\u00b78\t+0\u00b71\n8\t224\t3\u00b73\t3\u00b72\t-0\u00b71\n\n  283. The results of the experiments are shown in Table XVI. If the motion had not been aided by a start the powers would have been greater. Thus in experiment 6, 2\u00b74 lbs. is the power with a start, when without a start 3\u00b72 lbs. was found to be necessary. The experiments have all been aided by a start, and the results recorded have been corrected for the friction of the pulley over which the rope passes: this correction is very small, in no case exceeding 0\u00b72 lb. The fourth column contains the values of the powers computed by the formula P = 0\u00b70143 R. This formula has been deduced from the observations [Pg 143]in the manner described in the Appendix. The fifth column proves that the experiments are truly represented by the formula: in each of the experiments 7 and 8, the difference between the calculated and observed values amounts to 0\u00b71 lb., but this is quite inconsiderable in comparison with the weights we are employing.\n\n284. In order to lift 100 lbs. the expression 0\u00b70143 R shows that 1\u00b743 lbs. would be necessary: hence the mechanical efficiency of the screw is 100 \u00f7 1\u00b743 = 70. Thus this screw is vastly more powerful than any of the pulley systems which we have discussed. A machine so capable, so compact, and so strong as the screw, is invaluable for innumerable purposes in the Arts, as well as in multitudes of appliances in daily use.\n\n285. It is evident, however, that the distance through which the screw can raise a weight must be limited by the length of the screw itself, and that in the length of lift the screw cannot compete with many of the other contrivances used in raising weights.\n\n286. We have seen that the velocity ratio is 193; therefore, to raise 100 lbs. 1 foot, we find that 1\u00b743 \u00d7 193 = 276 units of energy must be expended: of this only 100 units, or 36 per cent., is usefully employed; the rest being consumed in overcoming the friction of the screw. Thus nearly two-thirds of the energy applied to such a screw is wasted. Hence we find that friction does not permit the load to run down, since less than fifty per cent. of the applied energy is usefully employed (Art. 222). This is one of the valuable properties which the screw possesses.\n\n287. We may contrast the screw with the pulley-block (Art. 199). They are both powerful machines: the latter is bulky and economical of power, the former is compact and wasteful of power; the latter is adapted for raising weights through considerable distances, and the former for exerting pressures through short distances.[Pg 144]\n\n\nFig. 44.\n\n[Pg 145]\n\nTHE SCREW-JACK.\n288. The importance of the screw as a mechanical power justifies us in examining another of its useful forms, the screw-jack. This machine is used for exerting great pressures, such for example as starting a ship which is reluctant to be launched, or replacing a locomotive upon the line from which its wheels have slipped. These machines vary in form, as well as in the weights for which they are adapted; one of them is shown at d in Fig. 44, and a description of its details is given in Table XVII. We shall determine the powers to be applied to this machine for overcoming resistances not exceeding half a ton.\n\n289. To employ weights so large as half a ton would be inconvenient if not actually impossible in the lecture room, but the required pressures can be produced by means of a lever. In Fig. 44 is shown a stout wooden bar 16' long. It is prevented from bending by means of a chain; at e the lever is attached to a hinge, about which it turns freely; at a a tray is placed for the purpose of receiving weights. The screw-jack is 2' distant from e, consequently the bar is a lever of the second order, and any weight placed in the tray exerts a pressure eightfold greater upon the top of the screw-jack. Thus each stone in the tray produces a pressure of 1 cwt. at the point d. The weight of the lever and the tray is counterpoised by the weight c, so that until the tray receives a load there is no pressure upon the top of the screw-jack, and thus we may omit the lever itself from consideration. The screw-jack is furnished with an arm d g; at the extremity g of this arm a rope is attached, which passes over a pulley and supports the power b.[Pg 146]\n\n290. The velocity ratio for this screw-jack with an arm of 33\", is found to be 414, by the method already described (Art. 283).\n\n  291. To determine its mechanical efficiency we must resort to experiment. The result is given in Table XVII.\n\nTable XVII.\u2014The Screw-Jack.\n\nWrought iron screw, square thread, diameter 2\", pitch 2 threads to the inch, arm 33\"; nut brass, bearing surfaces oiled; velocity ratio 414; useful effect, 28 per cent.; mechanical efficiency 116; formula P = 0\u00b766 + 0\u00b70075 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\nLoad\n in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifference of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t112\t1\u00b74\t1\u00b75\t+0\u00b71\n2\t224\t2\u00b72\t2\u00b73\t+0\u00b71\n3\t336\t3\u00b73\t3\u00b72\t-0\u00b71\n4\t448\t4\u00b71\t4\u00b70\t-0\u00b71\n5\t560\t5\u00b70\t4\u00b79\t-0\u00b71\n6\t672\t5\u00b77\t5\u00b77\t\u20070\u00b70\n7\t784\t6\u00b75\t6\u00b75\t\u20070\u00b70\n8\t896\t7\u00b74\t7\u00b74\t\u20070\u00b70\n9\t1008\u2007\t8\u00b71\t8\u00b72\t+0\u00b71\n10\t1120\u2007\t9\u00b70\t9\u00b71\t+0\u00b71\n\n292. It may be seen from the column of differences how closely the experiments are represented by the formula. The power which is required to raise a given weight, say 600 lbs., may be calculated by this formula; it is 0\u00b766 + 0\u00b70075 \u00d7 600 = 5\u00b716. Hence the mechanical efficiency of the screw-jack is 600 \u00f7 5\u00b716 = 116. Thus the screw is very powerful, increasing the force applied to it more than a hundredfold. In order to raise 600 lbs. one foot, a quantity of work [Pg 147]represented by 5\u00b716 \u00d7 414 = 2136 units must be expended; of this only 600, or 28 per cent., is utilized, so that nearly three-quarters of the energy applied is expended upon friction.\n\n293. This screw does not let the load run down, since less than 50 per cent. of energy is utilised; to lower the weight the lever has actually to be pressed backwards.\n\n294. The details of an experiment on this subject will be instructive, and afford a confirmation of the principles laid down. In experiment 10 we find that 9\u00b70 lbs. suffice to raise 1,120 lbs.; now by moving the pulley to the other side of the lever, and placing the rope perpendicularly to the lever, I find that to produce motion the other way\u2014that is, of course to lower the screw\u2014a force of 3\u00b74 lbs. must be applied. Hence, even with the assistance of the load, a force of 3\u00b74 lbs. is necessary to overcome friction. This will enable us to determine the amount of friction in the same manner as we determined the friction in the pulley-block (Art. 207). Let x be the force usefully employed in raising, and y the force of friction, which acts equally in either direction against the production of motion; then to raise the load the power applied must be sufficient to overcome both x and y, and therefore we have x + y = 9\u00b70. When the weight is to be lowered the force x of course aids in the lowering, but x alone is not sufficient to overcome the friction; it requires the addition of 3\u00b74 lbs., and we have therefore x + 3\u00b74 = y, and hence x = 2\u00b78, y = 6\u00b72.\n\nThat is, 2\u00b78 is the amount of force which with a frictionless screw would have been sufficient to raise half a ton. But in the frictionless screw the power is found by dividing the load by the velocity ratio. In this case 1120 \u00f7 414 = 2\u00b77, which is within 0\u00b71 lb. of the value of x. The agreement of these results is satisfactory.[Pg 148]\n\nTHE SCREW BOLT AND NUT.\n\nFig. 45.\n\n295. One of the most useful applications of the screw is met with in the common bolt and nut, shown in Fig. 45. It consists of a wrought iron rod with a head at one end and a screw on the other, upon which the nut works. Bolts in many different sizes and forms represent the stitches by which machines and frames are most readily united. There are several reasons why the bolt is so convenient. It draws the parts into close contact with tremendous force; it is itself so strong that the parts united practically form one piece. It can be adjusted quickly, and removed as readily. The same bolt by the use of washers can be applied to pieces of very different sizes. No skilled hand is required to use the simple tool that turns the nut. Adding to this that bolts are cheap and durable, we shall easily understand why they are so extensively used.\n\n296. We must remark in conclusion that the bolt owes its utility to friction; screws of this kind do not overhaul, hence when the nut is screwed home it does not recoil. If it were not that more than half the power applied to a screw is consumed in friction, the bolt and the nut would either be rendered useless, or at least would require to be furnished with some complicated apparatus for preventing the motion of the nut.[Pg 149]\n\nLECTURE X.\nTHE WHEEL AND AXLE.\nIntroduction.\u2014Experiments upon the Wheel and Axle.\u2014Friction upon the Axle.\u2014The Wheel and Barrel.\u2014The Wheel and Pinion.\u2014The Crane.\u2014Conclusion.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n297. The mechanical powers discussed in these lectures may be grouped into two classes,\u2014the first where ropes or chains are used, and the second where ropes or chains are absent. Belonging to that class in which ropes are not employed, we have the screw discussed in the last lecture; and the lever discussed in Lecture VIII.; while among those machines in which ropes or chains form an essential part of the apparatus, the pulley and the wheel and axle hold a prominent place. We have already examined several forms of the pulley, and we now proceed to the not less important subject of the wheel and axle.\n\n298. Where great resistances have to be overcome, but where the distance through which the resistance must be urged is short, the lever or the screw is generally found to be the most appropriate means of [Pg 150]increasing power. When, however, the resistance has to be moved a considerable distance, the aid of the pulley, or the wheel and axle, or sometimes of both combined, is called in. The wheel and axle is the form of mechanical power which is generally used when the distance is considerable through which a weight must be raised, or through which some resistance must be overcome.\n\n\nFig. 46.\n\n299. The wheel and axle assumes very many forms corresponding to the [Pg 151]various purposes to which it is applied. The general form of the arrangement will be understood from Fig. 46. It consists of an iron axle b, mounted in bearings, so as to be capable of turning freely; to this axle a rope is fastened, and at the extremity of the rope is a weight d, which is gradually raised as the axle revolves. Attached to the axle, and turning with it, is a wheel a with hooks in its circumference, upon which lies a rope; one end of this rope is attached to the circumference of the wheel, and the other supports a weight e. This latter weight may be called the power, while the weight d suspended from the axle is the load. When the power is sufficiently large, e descends, making the wheel to revolve; the wheel causes the axle to revolve, and thus the rope is wound up and the load d is raised.\n\n300. When compared with the differential pulley as a means of raising a weight, this arrangement appears rather bulky and otherwise inconvenient, but, as we shall presently learn, it is a far more economical means of applying energy. In its practical application, moreover, the arrangement is simplified in various ways, two of which may be mentioned.\n\n301. The capstan is essentially a wheel and axle; the power is not in this case applied by means of a rope, but by direct pressure on the part of the men working it; nor is there actually a wheel employed, for the pressure is applied to what would be the extremities of the spokes of the wheel if a wheel existed.\n\n302. In the ordinary winch, the power of the labourer is directly applied to the handle which moves round in the circumference of a circle.\n\n303. There are innumerable other applications of the principle which are constantly met with, and which can be easily understood with a [Pg 152]little attention. These we shall not stop to describe, but we pass on at once to the important question of the relation between the power and the load.\n\nEXPERIMENTS UPON THE WHEEL AND AXLE.\n  304. We shall commence a series of experiments upon the wheel a and axle b of Fig. 46. We shall first determine the velocity ratio, and then ascertain the mechanical efficiency by actual experiment. The wheel is of wood; it is about 30\" in diameter. The string to which the power is attached is coiled round a series of hooks, placed near the margin of the wheel; the effective circumference is thus a little less than the real circumference. I measure a single coil of the string and find the length to be 88\"\u00b75. This length, therefore, we shall adopt for the effective circumference of the wheel. The axle is 0\"\u00b775 in diameter, but its effective circumference is larger than the circle of which this length is the diameter.\n\n305. The proper mode of finding the effective circumference of the axle in a case where the rope bears a considerable proportion to the axle is as follows. Attach a weight to the extremity of the rope sufficient to stretch it thoroughly. Make the wheel and axle revolve suppose 20 times, and measure the height through which the weight is lifted; then the one-twentieth part of that height is the effective circumference of the axle. By this means I find the circumference of the axle we are using to be 2\"\u00b787.\n\n306. We can now ascertain the velocity ratio in this machine. When the wheel and axle have made one complete revolution the power has been lowered through a distance of 88\"\u00b75, and the load has been raised [Pg 153]through 2\"\u00b787. This is evident because the wheel and axle are attached together, and therefore each completes one revolution in the same time; hence the ratio of the distance which the power moves over to that through which the load is raised is 88\"\u00b75 \u00f7 2\"\u00b787 = 31 very nearly. We shall therefore suppose the velocity ratio to be 31. Thus this wheel and axle has a far higher velocity ratio than any of the systems of pulleys which we have been considering.\n\n307. Were friction absent the velocity ratio of 31 would necessarily express the mechanical efficiency of this wheel and axle; owing to the presence of friction the real efficiency is less than this\u2014how much less, we must ascertain by experiment. I attach a load of 56 lbs. to the hook which is borne by the rope descending from the axle: this load is shown at d in Fig. 46. I find that a power of 2\u00b76 lbs. applied at e is just sufficient to raise d. We infer from this result that the mechanical efficiency of this machine is 56 \u00f7 2\u00b76 = 21\u00b75. I add a second 56 lb. weight to the load, and I find that a power of 5\u00b70 lbs. raises the load of 112 lbs. The mechanical efficiency in this case is 112 \u00f7 5\u00b75 = 22\u00b75. We adopt the mean value 22. Hence the mechanical efficiency is reduced by friction from 31 to 22.\n\n308. We may compute from this result the number of units of energy which are utilized out of every 100 units applied. Let us suppose a load of 100 lbs. is to be raised one foot; a force of 100 \u00f7 22 = 4\u00b76 lbs. will suffice to raise this load. This force must be exerted through a space of 31', and consequently 31 \u00d7 4\u00b76 = 143 units of energy must be expended; of this amount 100 units are usefully employed, and therefore the percentage of energy utilized is 100 \u00f7 143 \u00d7 100 = 70. It follows that 30 per cent. of the applied energy is consumed in overcoming friction.\n\n  309. We can see the reason why the wheel and axle overhauls\u2014that is, [Pg 154]runs down of its own accord\u2014when allowed to do so; it is because less than half the applied energy is expended upon friction.\n\n  310. A series of experiments which have been carefully made with this wheel and axle are recorded in Table XVIII.\n\nTable XVIII.\u2014Wheel and Axle.\n\nWheel of wood; axle of iron, in oiled brass bearings; weight of wheel and axle together, 16\u00b75 lbs.; effective circumference of wheel, 88\"\u00b75; effective circumference of axle, 2\"\u00b787; velocity ratio, 31; mechanical efficiency, 22; useful effect, 70 per cent.; formula, P = 0\u00b7204 + 0\u00b70426 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\nLoad\n in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifference of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t28\t1\u00b74\t1\u00b74\t0\u00b70\n2\t42\t2\u00b70\t2\u00b70\t0\u00b70\n3\t56\t2\u00b76\t2\u00b76\t0\u00b70\n4\t70\t3\u00b72\t3\u00b72\t0\u00b70\n5\t84\t3\u00b77\t3\u00b78\t+0\u00b71\n6\t98\t4\u00b74\t4\u00b74\t0\u00b70\n7\t112\t5\u00b70\t5\u00b70\t0\u00b70\n\nBy the method of the Appendix a relation connecting the power and the load has been determined; it is expressed in the form\u2014\n\nP = 0\u00b7204 + 0\u00b70426 R.\n\n311. Thus for example in experiment 5 a load of 84 lbs. was found to be raised by a power of 3\u00b77 lbs. The value calculated by the formula is 0\u00b7204 + 0\u00b70426 \u00d7 84 = 3\u00b78. The calculated value only differs from the observed value by 0\u00b71 lb., which is shown in the fifth column. It will be seen from this column that the values calculated from the formula represents the experiments with fidelity.[Pg 155]\n\n312. We have deduced the relation between the power and the load from the principle of energy, but we might have obtained it from the principle of the lever. The wheel and axle both revolve about the centre of the axle; we may therefore regard the centre as the fulcrum of a lever, and the points where the cords meet the wheel and axle as the points of application of the power and the load respectively.\n\n313. By the principle of the lever of the first order (Art. 237), the power is to the load in the inverse proportion of the arms; in this case, therefore, the power is to the load in the inverse proportion of the radii of the wheel and the axle. But the circumferences of circles are in proportion to their radii, and therefore the power must be to the load as the circumference of the axle is to the circumference of the wheel.\n\n314. This mode of arriving at the result is a little artificial; it is more natural to deduce the law directly from the principle of energy. In a mechanical power of any complexity it would be difficult to trace exactly the transmission of power from one part to the next, but the principle of energy evades this difficulty; no matter what be the mechanical arrangement, simple or complex, of few parts or of many, we have only to ascertain by trial how many feet the power must traverse in order to raise the load one foot; the number thus obtained is the theoretical efficiency of the machine.\n\nFRICTION UPON THE AXLE.\n315. In the wheel and axle upon which we have been experimenting, we have found that about 30 per cent. of the power is consumed by friction. We shall be able to ascertain to what this loss is due, and then in some degree to remove its cause. From the experiments of Art. 165 [Pg 156]we learned that the friction of a small pulley was very much greater than that of a large pulley\u2014in fact, the friction is inversely proportional to the diameter of the pulley. We infer from this that by winding the rope upon a barrel instead of upon the axle, the friction may be diminished.\n\n\nFig. 47.\n\n316. We can examine experimentally the effect of friction on the axle by the apparatus of Fig. 47. b is a shaft 0\"\u00b775 diameter, about which a rope is coiled several times; the ends of this rope hang down freely, and to each of them hooks e, f [Pg 157]are attached. This shaft revolves in brass bearings, which are oiled. In order to investigate the amount of power lost by winding the rope upon an axle of this size, I shall place a certain weight\u2014suppose 56 lbs.\u2014upon one hook f, and then I shall ascertain what amount of power hung upon the other hook e will be sufficient to raise f. There is here no mechanical advantage, so that the excess of load which e must receive in order to raise f is the true measure of the friction.\n\n317. I add on weights at e until the power reaches 85 lbs., when e descends. We thus see that to raise 56 lbs. an excess of 29 lbs. was necessary to overcome the friction. We may roughly enunciate the result by stating that to raise a load in this way, half as much again is required for the power. This law is verified by suspending 28 lbs. at f, when it is found that a power of 43 lbs. at e is required to lift it. Had the power been 42 lbs., it would have been exactly half as much again as the load.\n\n318. Hence in raising f upon this axle, about one-third of the power which must be applied at the circumference of the axle is wasted. This experiment teaches us where the loss lies in the wheel and axle of Art. 304, and explains how it is that about a third of its efficiency is lost. 85 lbs. was only able to raise two-thirds of its own weight, owing to the friction; and hence we should expect to find, as we actually have found, that the power applied at the circumference of the wheel has an effect which is only two-thirds of its theoretical efficiency.\n\n  319. From this experiment we should infer that the proper mode of avoiding the loss by friction is to wind the rope upon a barrel of considerable diameter rather than upon the axle itself. I place upon a similar axle to that on which we have been already experimenting a barrel of about 15\" circumference. I coil the rope two or three times [Pg 158]about the barrel, and let the ends hang down as before. I then attach to each end 56 lbs. weight, and I find that 10 lbs. added to either of the weights is sufficient to overcome friction, to make it descend, and raise the other weight. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 47. a is the barrel, c and d are the weights. In this arrangement 10 lbs. is sufficient to overcome the friction which required 29 lbs. when the rope was simply coiled around the axle. In other words, by the barrel the loss by friction is reduced to one-third of its amount.\n\nTHE WHEEL AND BARREL.\n320. We next place the barrel upon the axis already experimented upon and shown in Fig. 46 at b. The circumference of the wheel is 88\"\u00b75; the circumference of the barrel is 14\"\u00b79. The proper mode of finding the circumference of the barrel is to suspend a weight from the rope, then raise this weight by making one revolution of the wheel, and the distance through which the weight is raised is the effective circumference of the barrel. The velocity ratio of the wheel and barrel is then found, by dividing 14\u00b79 into 88\u00b75, to be 5\u00b794.\n\n321. The mechanical efficiency of this machine is determined by experiment. I suspend a weight of 56 lbs. from the hook, and apply power to the wheel. I find that 10\u00b71 lbs. is just sufficient to raise the load.\n\n322. The mechanical efficiency is to be found by dividing 10\u00b71 into 56; the quotient thus obtained is 5\u00b754. The mechanical efficiency does not differ much from 5\u00b794, the velocity ratio; and consequently in this machine but little power is expended upon friction.\n\n  323. We can ascertain the loss by computing the percentage of applied [Pg 159]energy which is utilized. Let us suppose a weight of 100 lbs. has to be raised one foot: for this purpose a force of 100 \u00f7 5\u00b754 = 18\u00b71 lbs. must be applied. This is evident from the definition of the mechanical efficiency; but since the load has to be raised one foot, it is clear from the meaning of the velocity ratio that the power must move over 5'\u00b794: hence the number of units of work to be applied is to be measured by the product of 5\u00b794 and 18\u00b71, that is, by 107\u00b75; in order therefore to accomplish 100 units of work 107\u00b75 units of work must be applied. The percentage of energy usefully employed is 100 \u00f7 107\u00b75 \u00d7 100 = 93. This is far more than 70, which is the percentage utilized when the axle was used without the barrel (Art. 309).\n\n  324. A series of experiments made with care upon the wheel and barrel are recorded in Table XIX.\n\nTable XIX.\u2014The Wheel and Barrel.\n\nWheel of wood, 88\"\u00b75 in circumference, on the same axle as a cast iron barrel of 14\"\u00b79 circumference; axle is of wrought iron, 0\"\u00b775 in diameter, mounted in oiled brass bearings; power is applied to the circumference of the wheel, load raised by rope round barrel; velocity ratio, 5\u00b794; mechanical efficiency, 5\u00b754; useful effect, 93 per cent.; formula, P = 0\u00b75 + 0\u00b7169 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\nLoad\n in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifference of the\nobserved and\n calculated values.\n1\t14\t\u20072\u00b77\t\u20072\u00b79\t+0\u00b72\n2\t28\t\u20075\u00b73\t\u20075\u00b72\t-0\u00b71\n3\t42\t\u20077\u00b77\t\u20077\u00b76\t-0\u00b71\n4\t56\t10\u00b71\t10\u00b70\t-0\u00b71\n5\t70\t12\u00b74\t12\u00b74\t\u20070\u00b70\n6\t84\t14\u00b77\t14\u00b77\t\u20070\u00b70\n7\t98\t17\u00b71\t17\u00b71\t\u20070\u00b70\n8\t112\u2007\t19\u00b74\t19\u00b75\t+0\u00b71\n\n[Pg 160]The formula which represents the experiments with the greatest amount of accuracy is P = 0\u00b75 + 0\u00b7169 R. This formula is compared with the experiments, and the column of differences shows that the calculated and the observed values agree very closely. The constant part 0\u00b75 is partly due to the constant friction of the heavy barrel and wheel, and partly, it may be, to small irregularities which have prevented the centre of gravity of the whole mass from being strictly in the axle.\n\n325. Though this machine is more economical of power than the wheel and axle of Art 305, yet it is less powerful; in fact, the mechanical efficiency, 5\u00b754, is only about one-fourth of that of the wheel and axle. It is therefore necessary to inquire whether we cannot devise some method by which to secure the advantages of but little friction, and at the same time have a large mechanical efficiency: this we shall proceed to investigate.\n\nTHE WHEEL AND PINION.\n326. By means of what are called cog-wheels or toothed wheels, we are enabled to combine two or more wheels and axles together, and thus greatly to increase the power which can be produced by a single wheel and axle. Toothed wheels are used for a great variety of purposes in mechanics; we have already had some illustration of their use during these lectures (Fig. 30). The wheels which we shall employ are those often used in lathes and other small machines; they are what are called 10-pitch wheels,\u2014that is to say, a wheel of this class contains ten times as many teeth in its circumference as there are inches in its diameter. I have here a wheel 20\" diameter, and consequently it has 200 teeth; here is another which is 2\"\u00b75 diameter, and which consequently [Pg 161]contains 25 teeth. We shall mount these wheels upon two parallel shafts, so that they gear one into the other in the manner shown in Fig. 46: f is the large wheel containing 200 teeth, and g the pinion of 25 teeth. The axles are 0\"\u00b775 diameter; around each of them a rope is wound, by which a hook is suspended.\n\n327. A small weight at k is sufficient to raise a much larger weight on the other shaft; but before experimenting on the mechanical efficiency of this arrangement, we shall as usual calculate the velocity ratio. The wheel contains eight times as many teeth as the pinion; it is therefore evident that when the wheel has made one revolution, the pinion will have made eight revolutions, and conversely the pinion must turn round eight times to turn the wheel round once: hence the power which is turning the pinion round must be lowered through eight times the circumference of the axle, while the load is raised through a length equal to one circumference of the axle. We thus find the velocity ratio of the machine to be 8.\n\n328. We determine the mechanical efficiency by trial. Attaching a load of 56 lbs. to the axle of the large wheel, it is observed that a power of 13\u00b77 lbs. at k will raise it; the mechanical efficiency of the machine is therefore about 4\u00b71, which is almost exactly half the velocity ratio. We note that the load will only just run down when the power is removed; from this we might have inferred, by Art. 222, that nearly half the power is expended on friction, and that therefore the mechanical efficiency is about half the velocity ratio. The actual percentage of energy that is utilised with this particular load is 51. If we suspend 112 lbs. from the load hook, 26 lbs. is just enough to raise it; the mechanical efficiency that would be deduced from this result is 112 \u00f7 26 = 4\u00b73, which is slightly in excess [Pg 162]of the amount obtained by the former experiment. It is often found to be a property of the mechanical powers, that as the load increases the mechanical efficiency slightly improves.\n\n329. In Table XX. will be found a record of experiments upon the relation between the power and the load with the wheel and pinion; the table will sufficiently explain itself, after the description of similar tables already given (Arts. 310, 324).\n\nTable XX.\u2014The Wheel and Pinion.\n\nWheel (10-pitch), 200 teeth; pinion, 25 teeth; axles equal, effective circumference of each being 2\"\u00b787; oiled brass bearings; velocity ratio, 8; mechanical efficiency, 4\u00b71; useful effect, 51 per cent.; formula, P = 2\u00b746 + 0\u00b721 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\nLoad\n in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifference of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t14\t\u20075\u00b74\t\u20075\u00b74\t\u20070\u00b70\n2\t28\t\u20078\u00b77\t\u20078\u00b73\t-0\u00b74\n3\t42\t11\u00b70\t11\u00b73\t+0\u00b73\n4\t56\t13\u00b77\t14\u00b72\t+0\u00b75\n5\t70\t17\u00b75\t17\u00b72\t-0\u00b73\n6\t84\t20\u00b70\t20\u00b71\t+0\u00b71\n7\t98\t23\u00b70\t23\u00b70\t\u20070\u00b70\n8\t112\u2007\t26\u00b70\t26\u00b70\t\u20070\u00b70\n\n330. The large amount of friction present in this contrivance is the consequence of winding the rope directly upon the axle instead of upon a barrel, as already pointed out in Art. 319. We might place barrels upon these axles and demonstrate the truth of this statement; but we need not delay to do so, as we use the barrel in the machines which we shall next describe.\n\nTHE CRANE.\n331. We have already explained (Art. 38) the construction of the lifting crane, so far as its framework is concerned. We now examine the mechanism by which the load is raised. We shall employ for this purpose [Pg 163]the model which is represented in Fig. 48. The jib is supported by a wooden bar as a tie, and the crane is steadied by means of the weights placed at h: some such counterpoise is necessary, for otherwise the machine would tumble over when a load is suspended from the hook.\n\n 332. The load is supported by a rope or chain which passes over the pulley e and thence to the barrel d, upon which it is to be wound. This barrel receives its motion from a large wheel a, which contains 200 teeth.\n\nThe wheel a is turned by the pinion b which contains 25 teeth. In the actual use of the crane, the axle which carries this pinion would be turned round by means of a handle; but for the purpose of experiments upon the relation of the power to the load, the handle would be inconvenient, and therefore we have placed upon the axle of the pinion a wheel c containing a groove in its circumference. Around this groove a string is wrapped, so that when a weight g is suspended from the string it will cause the wheel to revolve. This weight g will constitute the power by which the load may be raised.\n\n333. Let us compute the velocity ratio of this machine before commencing experiments upon its mechanical efficiency. The effective circumference of the barrel d is found by trial to be 14\"\u00b79. Since there are 200 teeth on a and 25 on b, it follows that the pinion b must revolve eight times to produce one revolution of the barrel. Hence the wheel c at the circumference of which the power is applied must also revolve eight times for one revolution of the barrel. The effective circumference of c is 43\"; the power must therefore have been applied through 8 \u00d7 43\" = 344\", in order to raise the load 15\"\u00b79. The velocity ratio is 344 \u00f7 14\u00b79 = 23 very nearly. We can easily verify this value of the velocity ratio by actually raising the load 1', when it appears that the number of revolutions of the wheel b is such that the power must have moved 23'.[Pg 164]\n\n\nFig. 48.\n\n[Pg 165]334. The mechanical efficiency is to be found as usual by trial. 56 lbs. placed at f is raised by 3\u00b71 lbs. at G; hence the mechanical efficiency deduced from this experiment is 56 \u00f7 3\u00b71 = 18. The percentage of useful effect is easily shown to be 78 by the method of Art. 323. Here, then, we have a machine possessing very considerable efficiency, and being at the same time economical of energy.\n\nTable XXI.\u2014The Crane.\n\nCircumference of wheel to which the power is applied, 43\"; train of wheels, 25 \u00f7 200; circumference of drum on which rope is wound, 14\"\u00b79; velocity ratio, 23; mechanical efficiency, 18; useful effect, 78 per cent.; formula, P = 0\u00b70556 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\nLoad\n in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifference of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t14\t\u20070\u00b79\t\u20070\u00b78\t\u2007-0\u00b71\n2\t28\t1\u00b76\t1\u00b76\t\u20070\u00b70\n3\t42\t2\u00b74\t2\u00b73\t-0\u00b71\n4\t56\t3\u00b71\t3\u00b71\t\u20070\u00b70\n5\t70\t3\u00b78\t3\u00b79\t+0\u00b71\n6\t84\t4\u00b75\t4\u00b77\t+0\u00b72\n7\t98\t5\u00b73\t5\u00b75\t+0\u00b72\n8\t112\u2007\t6\u00b72\t6\u00b72\t+0\u00b70\n\n335. A series of experiments made with this crane is recorded in Table XXI., and a comparison of the calculated and observed values will show that the formula P = 0\u00b70556 R represents the experiments with considerable accuracy.\n\n336. It may be noticed that in this formula the term independent of R, which we frequently meet with in the expression of the relation between the power and the load, is absent. The probable explanation is to be found in the fact that some minute irregularity in the form of the [Pg 166]barrel or of the wheel has been constantly acting like a small weight in favour of the power. In each experiment the motion is always started from the same position of the wheels, and hence any irregularity will be constantly acting in favour of the power or against it; here the former appears to have happened. In other cases doubtless the latter has occurred; the difference is, however, of extremely small amount. The friction of the machine itself when without a load is another source for the production of the constant term; it has happened in the present case that this friction has been almost exactly balanced by the accidental influence referred to.\n\n  337. In cranes it is usual to provide means of adding a second train of wheels, when the load is very heavy. In another model we applied the power to an axle with a pinion of 25 teeth, gearing into a wheel of 200 teeth; on the axle of the wheel with 200 teeth is a pinion of 30 teeth, which gears into a wheel of 180 teeth; the barrel is on the axle of the last wheel. A series of experiments with this crane is shown in Table XXII.\n\nTable XXII.\u2014The Crane for Heavy Loads.\n\nCircumference of wheel to which power is applied, 43\"; train of wheels, 25 \u00f7 200 \u00d7 30 \u00f7 180; circumference of drum on which rope is wound, 14\"\u00b79; velocity ratio, 137; mechanical efficiency, 87; useful effect, 63 per cent.; formula, P = 0\u00b7185 + 0\u00b700782 R.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tR.\nLoad\n in lbs. \t Observed\npower\nin lbs.\tP.\n Calculated\npower\nin lbs.\tDifference of the\nobserved and\n calculated powers.\n1\t14\t0\u00b730\t0\u00b729\t\u2007-0\u00b701\n2\t28\t0\u00b740\t0\u00b740\t\u20070\u00b700\n3\t42\t0\u00b750\t0\u00b751\t+0\u00b701\n4\t56\t0\u00b760\t0\u00b762\t+0\u00b702\n5\t70\t0\u00b775\t0\u00b773\t-0\u00b702\n6\t84\t0\u00b785\t0\u00b784\t-0\u00b701\n7\t98\t0\u00b795\t0\u00b795\t\u20070\u00b700\n8\t112\u2007\t1\u00b705\t1\u00b706\t+0\u00b701\n\n[Pg 167]The velocity ratio is now 137, and the mechanical efficiency is 87; one man could therefore raise a ton with ease by applying a power of 26 lbs. to a crane of this kind.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n338. It will be useful to contrast the wheel and axle on which we have experimented (Art. 304) with the differential pulley (Art. 209). The velocity ratio of the former machine is nearly double that of the latter, and its mechanical efficiency is nearly four times as great. Less than half the applied power is wasted in the wheel and axle, while more than half is wasted in the differential pulley. This makes the wheel and axle both a more powerful machine, and a more economical machine than the differential pulley. On the other hand, the greater compactness of the latter, its facility of application, and the practical conveniences arising from the property of not allowing the load to run down, do often more than compensate for the superior mechanical advantage of the wheel and axle.\n\n339. We may also contrast the wheel and axle with the screw (Art. 277). The screw is remarkable among the mechanical powers for its very high velocity ratio, and its excessive friction. Thus we have seen in Art. 291 how the velocity ratio of a screw-jack with an arm attached amounted to 414, while its mechanical efficiency was little more than one-fourth as great. No single wheel and axle could conveniently be made to give a mechanical efficiency of 116; but from Art. 337 we could easily design a combination of wheels and axles to yield an efficiency of quite this amount. The friction in the wheel and axle is very much less than in the screw, and consequently energy is saved by the use of the former machine.[Pg 168]\n\n340. In practice, however, it generally happens that economy of energy does not weigh much in the selection of a mechanical power for any purpose, as there are always other considerations of greater consequence.\n\n341. For example, let us take the case of a lifting crane employed in loading or unloading a vessel, and inquire why it is that a train of wheels is generally used for the purpose of producing the requisite power. The answer is simple, the train of wheels is convenient, for by their aid any length of chain can be wound upon the barrel; whereas if a screw were used, we should require a screw as long as the greatest height of lift. This screw would be inconvenient, and indeed impracticable, and the additional circumstance that a train of wheels is more economical of energy than a screw has no influence in the matter.\n\n342. On the other hand, suppose that a very heavy load has to be overcome for a short distance, as for example in starting a ship launch, a screw-jack is evidently the proper machine to employ; it is easily applied, and has a high mechanical efficiency. The want of economy of energy is of no consequence in such an operation.[Pg 169]\n\nLECTURE XI.\nTHE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF TIMBER.\nIntroduction.\u2014The General Properties of Timber.\u2014Resistance to Extension.\u2014Resistance to Compression.\u2014Condition of a Beam strained by a Transverse Force.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n343. In the lectures on the mechanical powers which have been just completed, we have seen how great weights may be raised or other large resistances overcome. We are now to consider the important subject of the application of mechanical principles to structures. These are fixtures, while machines are adapted for motion; a roof or a bridge is a structure, but a crane or a screw-jack is a machine. Structures are employed for supporting weights, and the mechanical powers give the means of raising them.\n\n344. A structure has to support both its own weight and also any load that is to be placed upon it. Thus a railway bridge must at all times sustain what is called the permanent load, and frequently, of course, the weight of one or more trains. The problem which the engineer solves is to design a bridge which shall be sufficiently strong, and, at the [Pg 170]same time, economical; his skill is shown by the manner in which he can attain these two ends in the same structure.\n\n345. In the four lectures of the course which will be devoted to this subject it will only be possible to give a slight sketch, and therefore but few details can be introduced. An extended account of the properties of different materials used in structures would be beyond our scope, but there are some general principles relating to the strength of materials which may be discussed. Timber, as a building material, has, in modern times, been replaced to a great extent by iron in large structures, but timber is more capable than iron of being experimented upon in the lecture room. The elementary laws which we shall demonstrate with reference to the strength of timber, are also, substantially the same as the corresponding laws for the strength of iron or any other material. Hence we shall commence the study of structures by two lectures on timber. The laws which we shall prove experimentally will afterwards be applied to a few simple cases of bridges and other actual structures.\n\nTHE GENERAL PROPERTIES OF TIMBER.\n346. The uses of timber in the arts are as various as its qualities. Some woods are useful for their beauty, and others for their strength or durability under different circumstances. We shall only employ \u201cpine\u201d in our experimental inquiries. This wood is selected because it is so well known and so much used. A knowledge of the properties of pine would probably be more useful than a knowledge of the properties of any other wood, and at the same time it must be remembered that the laws which we shall establish by means of slips of pine may be generally applied.\n\n347. A transverse section of a tree shows a number of rings, each of [Pg 171]which represents the growth of wood in one year. The age of the tree may sometimes be approximately found by counting the number of distinguishable rings. The outer rings are the newer portions of the wood.\n\n348. When a tree is felled it contains a large quantity of sap, which must be allowed to evaporate before the wood is fit for use. With this object the timber is stored in suitable yards for two or more years according to the purposes for which it is intended; sometimes the process of seasoning, as it is called, is hastened by other means. Wood, when seasoning, contracts; hence blocks of timber are often found split from the circumference to the centre, for the outer rings, being newer and containing more sap, contract more than the inner rings. For the same reason a plank is found to warp when the wood is not thoroughly seasoned. The side of the plank which was farthest from the centre of the tree contracts more than the other side, and becomes concave. This can be easily verified by looking at the edge of the plank, for we there see the rings of which it is composed.\n\n349. Timber may be softened by steaming. I have here a rod of pine, 24\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, and here a second rod cut from the same piece and of the same size, which has been exposed to steam of boiling water for more than an hour: securing these at one end to a firm stand, I bend them down together, and you see that after the dry rod has broken the steamed rod can be bent much farther before it gives way. This property of wood is utilized in shaping the timbers of wooden ships. We shall be able to understand the action of steam if we reflect that wood is composed of a number of fibres ranged side by side and united together. A rope is composed of a number of fibres laid together and twisted, but the fibres are not coherent as they are in wood. Hence we [Pg 172]find that a rod of wood is stiff, while a rope is flexible. The steam finds its way into the interstices between the fibres of the wood; it softens their connections, and increases the pliability of the fibres themselves, and thus, the operation of steaming tends to soften a piece of timber and render it tractable.\n\n350. The structure of wood is exhibited by the following simple experiment:\u2014Here are two pieces of pine, each 9\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\". One of them I easily snap across with a blow, while my blows are unable to break the other. The difference is merely that one of these pieces is cut against the grain, while the other is with it. In the first case I have only to separate the connection between the fibres, which is quite easy. In the other case I would have to tear asunder the fibres themselves, which is vastly more difficult. To a certain extent the grained structure is also found in wrought iron, but the contrast between the strength of iron with the grain and against the grain is not so marked as it is in wood.\n\nRESISTANCE TO EXTENSION.\n351. It will be necessary to explain a little more definitely what is meant by the strength of timber. We may conceive a rod to be broken in three different ways. In the first place the rod may be taken by a force at each end and torn asunder by pulling, as a thread may be broken. To do this requires very great power, and the strength of the material with reference to such a mode of destroying it is called its resistance to extension. In the second place, it may be broken by longitudinal pressure at each end, as a pillar may be crushed by the superincumbent weight being too large; the strength that relates to this form of force is called resistance to compression: finally, the rod may be broken by a force applied transversely. The strength of pine with reference to these different applications of force will be [Pg 173]considered successively. The rods that are to be used have been cut from the same piece of timber, which has been selected on account of its straightness of grain and freedom from knots. They are of different rectangular sections, 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 and 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 being generally used, but sometimes 1\" \u00d7 1\" is employed.\n\n\nFig. 49.\n\n352. With reference to the strength of timber in its capacity to resist extension, we can do but little in the lecture room. I have here a pine rod a b, of dimensions 48\" \u00d7 0\".5 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, Fig. 49. [Pg 174]Each end of this rod is firmly secured between two cheeks of iron, which are bolted together: the rod is suspended by its upper extremity from the hook of the epicycloidal pulley-block (Art. 213), which is itself supported by a tripod; hooks are attached to the lower end of the rod for carrying the weights. By placing 3 cwt. on these hooks and pulling the hand chain of the pulley-block, I find that I can raise the weight safely, and therefore the rod will resist at all events a tension of 3 cwt. From experiments which have been made on the subject, it is ascertained that about a ton would be necessary to tear such a rod asunder; hence we see that pine is enormously strong in resisting a force of extension. The tensile strength of the rod does not depend upon its length, but upon the area of the cross section. That of the rod we have used is one-fourth of a square inch, and the breaking weight of a rod one square inch in section is about four tons.\n\n  353. A rod of any material generally elongates to some extent under the action of a suspended weight; and we shall ascertain whether this occurs perceptibly in wood. Before the rod was strained I had marked two points upon it exactly 2 feet apart. When the rod supports 3 cwt. I find that the distance between the two points has not appreciably altered, though by more delicate measurement I have no doubt we should find that the distance had elongated to an insignificant extent.\n\n354. Let us contrast the resistance of a rod of timber to extension with the effect upon a rope under the same circumstances. I have here a rope about 0\".25 diameter; it is suspended from a point, and bears a 14 lb. weight in order to be completely stretched. I mark points upon the rope 2' apart. I now change the stone weight for a weight of 1 cwt., and on measurement I find that the two points which before were 2' [Pg 175]apart, are now 2' 2\"; thus the rope has stretched at the rate of an inch per foot for a strain of 1 cwt., while the timber did not stretch perceptibly for a strain of 3 cwt.\n\n355. We have already explained in Art. 37 the meaning of the word \u201ctie.\u201d The material suitable for a tie should be capable of offering great resistance, not only to actual rupture by tension, but even to appreciable elongation. These qualities we have found to be possessed by wood. They are, however, possessed in a much higher degree by wrought iron, which possesses other advantages in durability and facility of attachment.\n\nRESISTANCE TO COMPRESSION.\n356. We proceed to examine into the capability of timber to resist forces of longitudinal compression, either as a pillar or in any other form of \u201cstrut,\u201d such for instance, as the jib of the crane represented in Fig. 17. The use of timber as a strut depends in a great degree upon the coherence of the fibres to each other, as well as upon their actual rigidity. The action of timber in resisting forces of compression is thus very different from its action when resisting forces of extension; we can examine, by actual experiment, the strength of timber under the former conditions, as the weights which it will be necessary to employ are within the capabilities of our lecture room apparatus.\n\n357. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 50. It consists of a lever of the second order, 10' long, the mechanical advantage of which is threefold; the resistance of the pillar d e to crushing is the load to be overcome, and the power consists of weights, to receive which the tray b is used; every pound placed in the tray produces a compressive force of 3 lbs. on the pillar at d. The fulcrum is at a and guides at g. [Pg 176]The lever and the tray would somewhat complicate our calculations unless their weights were counterpoised. A cord attached to the extremity of the lever passes over a pulley f; at the other end of this cord, sufficient weights c are attached to neutralize the weight of the apparatus. In fact, the lever and tray now swing as if they had no weight, and we may therefore leave them out of consideration. The pillar to be experimented upon is fitted at its lower end e into a hole in a cast iron bracket: this bracket can be adjusted so as to take in pieces of different lengths; the upper end of the pillar passes through a hole in a second piece of cast iron, which is bolted to the lever: thus our little experimental column is secured at each end, and the risk of slipping is avoided. The stands are heavily weighted to secure the stability of the arrangement\n\n\nFig. 50.\n\n[Pg 177]358. The first experiment we shall make with this apparatus is upon a pine rod 40\" long and 0\"\u00b75 square; the lower bracket is so placed that the lever is horizontal when just resting upon the top of the rod. Weights placed in the tray produce a pressure three times as great down the rod, the effect of which will first be to bend the rod, and, when the deflection has reached a certain amount, to break it across. I place 28 lbs. in the tray: this produces a pressure of 84 lbs. upon the rod, but the rod still remains perfectly straight, so that it bears this pressure easily. When the pressure is increased to 96 lbs. a very slight amount of deflection may be seen. When the strain reaches 114 lbs. the rod begins to bend into a curved form, though the deflection of the middle of the rod from its original position is still less than 0\"\u00b725. Gradually augmenting the pressure, I find that when it reaches 132 lbs. the deviation has reached 0\"\u00b75; and finally, when 48 lbs. is placed in the tray, that is, when the rod is subjected to 144 lbs., it breaks across the middle. Hence we see that this rod sustained a load of 96 lbs. without sensibly bending, but that fracture ensued when the load was increased about half as much again. Another experiment with a similar rod gave a slightly less value (132 lbs.) for the breaking load. If I add these results together, and divide the sum by 2, I find 138 lbs. as the mean value of the breaking load, and this is a sufficiently exact determination.\n\n359. Let us next try the resistance of a shorter rod of the same section. I place a piece of pine 20\" long and 0\"\u00b75 square in the apparatus, firmly securing each end as in the former case. The lower bracket is adjusted so as to make the lever horizontal; the counterpoise, of course, remains the same, and weights are placed in the tray as before. No deflection is noticed when the rod supports 126 [Pg 178]lbs.; a very slight amount of bending is noticeable with 186 lbs.; with 228 lbs., the amount by which the centre of the rod has deviated laterally from its original position is about 0\"\u00b72; and finally, when the load reaches 294 lbs., the rod breaks. Fracture first occurs in the middle, but is immediately followed by other fractures near where the ends of the rod are secured.\n\n360. Hence the breaking load of a rod 20\" long is more than double the breaking load of a rod of 40\" long the same section; from this we learn that the sections being equal, short pillars are stronger than long pillars. It has been ascertained by experiment that the strength of a square pillar to resist compression is proportional to the square of its sectional area. Hence a rod of pine, 40\" long and 1\" square, having four times the section of the rod of the same length we have experimented on, would be sixteen times as strong, and consequently its breaking weight would amount to nearly a ton. The strength of a rod used as a tie depends only on its section, while the strength of a rod used as a strut depends on its length as well as on its section.\n\nCONDITION OF A BEAM STRAINED BY A TRANSVERSE FORCE.\n\n361. We next come to the important practical subject of the strength of timber when supporting a transverse strain; that is, when used as a beam. The nature of a transverse strain may be understood from Fig. 51, which represents a small beam, strained by a load at its centre. Fig. 52 shows two supports 40\" apart, across which a rod of pine 48\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" is laid; at the middle of this rod a hook is placed, from which a tray for the reception of weights is suspended. A rod thus [Pg 179]supported, and bearing weights, is said to be strained transversely. A rafter of a roof, the flooring of a room, a gangway from the wharf to a ship, many forms of bridge, and innumerable other examples, might be given of beams strained in this manner. To this important subject we shall devote the remainder of this lecture and the whole of the next.\n\n  362. The first point to be noticed is the deflection of the beam from which a weight is suspended. The beam is at first horizontal; but as the weight in the tray is augmented, the beam gradually curves downwards until, when the weight reaches a certain amount, the beam breaks across in the middle and the tray falls.\n\n\nFig. 51.\n\nFor convenience in recording the experiments the tray chain and hooks have been adjusted to weigh exactly 14 lbs. (Fig. 52). a b is a cord which is kept stretched by the little weights d: this cord gives a rough measure of the deflection of the beam from its horizontal position when strained by a load in the tray. In order to [Pg 180]observe the deflection accurately an instrument is used called the cathetometer (g). It consists of a small telescope, always directed horizontally, though capable of being moved up and down a vertical triangular pillar; on one of the sides of the pillar a scale is engraved, so that the height of the telescope in any position can be accurately determined. The cathetometer is levelled by means of the screws h h, so that the triangular pillar on which the telescope slides is accurately vertical: the dotted line shows the direction of the visual ray when the centre c of the beam is seen by the observer through the telescope.\n\n\nFig. 52.\n\n[Pg 181]Inside the telescope and at its focus a line of spider\u2019s web is fixed horizontally; on the bar to be observed, and near its middle point c, a cross of two fine lines is marked. The tray being removed, the beam becomes horizontal; the telescope of the cathetometer is then directed towards the beam, so that the lines marked upon it can be seen distinctly. By means of a screw the telescope may be raised or lowered until the spider\u2019s web inside the telescope is observed to pass through the image of the intersection of the lines. The scale then indicates precisely how high the telescope is on the pillar.\n\n363. While I look through the telescope my assistant suspends the tray from the beam. Instantly I see the cross descend in the field of view. I lower the telescope until the spider\u2019s web again passes through the image of the intersection of the lines, and then by looking at the scale I see that the telescope has been moved down 0\"\u00b719, that is, about one-fifth of an inch: this is, therefore, the distance by which the cross lines on the beam, and therefore the centre of the beam itself, must have descended. Indeed, even a simpler apparatus would be competent to measure the amount of deflection with some degree of precision. By placing successively one stone after another upon the tray, the beam is seen to deflect more and more, until even without the telescope you see the beam has deviated from the horizontal.\n\n364. By carefully observing with the telescope, and measuring in the way already described, the deflections shown in Table XXIII. were determined. The scale along the vertical pillar was read after the spider\u2019s web had been adjusted for each increase in the weight. The movement from the original position is recorded as the deflection for each load.[Pg 182]\n\nTable XXIII.\u2014Deflection of a Beam.\n\nA rod of pine 48\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\"; resting freely on supports 40\" apart; and laden in the middle.\n\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \t Magnitude\nof load.\t Deflection.\n1\t14\t0\"\u00b719\n2\t28\t0\"\u00b737\n3\t42\t0\"\u00b755\n4\t56\t0\"\u00b774\n5\t70\t0\"\u00b794\n6\t84\t1\"\u00b713\n7\t98\t1\"\u00b735\n8\t112\u2007\t1\"\u00b761\n9\t126\u2007\t1\"\u00b795\n10\u2007\t140\u2007\t2\"\u00b737\n\n365. The first column records the number of the experiment. The second represents the load, and the third contains the corresponding deflections. It will be seen that up to 98 lbs. the deflection is about 0\"\u00b72 for every stone weight, but afterwards the deflection increases more rapidly. When the weight reaches 140 lbs. the deflection at first indicated is 2\"\u00b737; but gradually the cross lines are seen to descend in the field of the telescope, showing that the beam is yielding and finally it breaks across. This experiment teaches us that a beam is at first deflected by an amount proportional to the weight it supports; but that when two-thirds of the breaking weight is reached, the beam is deflected more rapidly.\n\n  366. It is a question of the utmost importance to ascertain the greatest load a beam can sustain without injury to its strength. This subject is to be studied by examining the effect of different deflections upon the fibres of a beam. A beam is always deflected [Pg 183]whatever be the load it supports; thus by looking through the telescope of the cathetometer I can detect an increase of deflection when a single pound is placed in the tray: hence whenever a beam is loaded we must have some deflection. An experiment will show what amount of deflection may be experienced without producing any permanently injurious effect.\n\n  367. A pine rod 40\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" is freely supported at each end, the distances between the supports being 38\", and the tray is suspended from its middle point. A fine pair of cross lines is marked upon the beam, and the telescope of the cathetometer is adjusted so that the spider\u2019s line exactly passes through the image of the intersection. 14 lbs. being placed in the tray, the cross is seen to descend; the weight being removed, the cross returns precisely to its original position with reference to the spider\u2019s line: hence, after this amount of deflection, the beam has clearly returned to its initial condition, and is evidently just as good as it was before. The tray next received 56 lbs.; the beam was, of course, considerably deflected, but when the weight was removed the cross again returned,\u2014at all events, to within 0\"\u00b701 of where the spider\u2019s line was left to indicate its former position. We may consider that the beam is in this case also restored to its original condition, even though it has borne a strain which, including the tray, amounted to 70 lbs. But when the beam has been made to carry 84 lbs. for a few seconds, the cross does not completely return on the removal of the load from the tray, but it shows that the beam has now received a permanent deflection of 0\"\u00b703. This is still more apparent after the beam has carried 98 lbs., for when this load is removed the centre of the beam is permanently deflected by 0\"\u00b713. Here, then, we may infer that the fibres of the beam are beginning to be strained beyond their powers of resistance, and this is verified when [Pg 184]we find that with 28 additional pounds in the tray a collapse ensues.\n\n  368. Reasoning from this experiment, we might infer that the elasticity of a beam is not affected by a weight which is less than half that which would break it, and that, therefore, it may bear without injury a weight not exceeding this amount. As, however, in our experiments the weight was only applied once, and then but for a short time, we cannot be sure that a longer-continued or more frequent application of the same load might not prove injurious; hence, to be on the safe side, we assume that one-third of the breaking weight of a beam is the greatest load it should be made to bear in any structure. In many cases it is found desirable to make the beam much stronger than this ratio would indicate.\n\n369. We next consider the condition of the fibres of a beam when strained by a transverse force. It is evident that since the fracture commences at the lower surface of the beam, the fibres there must be in a state of tension, while those at the concave upper surface of the beam are compressed together. This condition of the fibres may be proved by the following experiment.\n\n370. I take two pine rods, each 48\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\", perfectly similar in all respects, cut from the same piece of timber, and therefore probably of very nearly identical strength. With a fine tenon saw I cut each of the rods half through at its middle point. I now place one of these beams on the supports 40\" apart, with the cut side of the beam upwards. I suspend from it the tray, which I gradually load with weights until the beam breaks, which it does when the total weight is 81 lbs.\n\nIf I were to place the second beam on the same supports with the cut [Pg 185]upwards, then there can be no doubt that it would require as nearly as possible the same weight to break it. I place it, however, with the cut downwards, I suspend the tray, and find that the beam breaks with a load of 31 lbs. This is less than half the weight that would have been required if the cut had been upwards.\n\n371. What is the cause of this difference? The fibres being compressed together on the upper surface, a cut has no tendency to open there; and if the cut could be made with an extremely fine saw, so as to remove but little material, the beam would be substantially the same as if it had not been tampered with. On the other hand, the fibres at the lower surface are in a state of tension; therefore when the cut is below it yawns open, and the beam is greatly weakened. It is, in fact, no stronger than a beam of 48\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 1\", placed with its shortest dimension vertical. If we remember that an entire beam of the same size required about 140 lbs. to break it (Art. 366), we see that the strength of a beam is reduced to one-fourth by being cut half-way through and having the cut underneath.\n\n372. We may learn from this the practical consequence that the sounder side of a beam should always be placed downwards. Any flaw on the lower surface will seriously weaken the beam: so that the most knotty face of the wood should certainly be placed uppermost. If a portion of the actual substance of a beam be removed\u2014for example, if a notch be cut out of it\u2014this will be almost equally injurious on either side of the beam.\n\n373. We may illustrate the condition of the upper surface of the beam by a further experiment. I make two cuts 0\"\u00b75 deep in the middle of a pine rod 48\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\". These cuts are 0\"\u00b75 apart, and slightly inclined; the piece between them being removed, a wedge is shaped to fit tightly into the space; the wedge is long enough to project a [Pg 186]little on one side. If the wedge be uppermost when the beam is placed on the supports, the beam will be in the same condition as if it had two fine cuts on the upper surface. I now load the beam with the tray in the usual manner, and I find it to bear 70 lbs. securely. On examining the beam, which has curved down considerably, I find that the wedge is held in very tightly by the pressure of the fibres upon it, but, by a sharp tap at the end, I knock out the wedge, and instantly the load of 70 lbs. breaks the beam; the reason is simple\u2014the piece being removed, there is no longer any resistance to the compressive strain of the upper fibres, and consequently the beam gives way.\n\n374. The collapse of a beam by a transverse strain commences by fracture of the fibres on the lower surface, followed by a rupture of all fibres up to a considerable depth. Here we see that by a transverse force the fibres in a beam of 48\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" have been broken by a strain of 140 lbs. (Art. 366); but we have already stated (Art. 353) that to tear such a rod across by a direct pull at each end a force of about four tons is necessary. The breaking strain of the fibres must be a certain definite quantity, yet we find that to overcome it in one way four tons is necessary, while by another mode of applying the strain 140 lbs. is sufficient.\n\n375. To explain this discrepancy we may refer to the experiment of Art. 28, wherein a piece of string was broken by the transverse pull of a piece of thread in illustration of the fact that one force may be resolved into two others, each of them very much greater than itself. A similar resolution of force occurs in the transverse deflection of the beam, and the force of 140 lbs. is changed into two other forces, each of them enormously greater and sufficiently strong to rupture the [Pg 187]fibres. We need not suppose that the force thus developed is so great as four tons, because that is the amount required to tear across a square inch of fibres simultaneously, whereas in the transverse fracture the fibres appear to be broken row after row; the fracture is thus only gradual, nor does it extend through the entire depth of the beam.\n\n  376. We shall conclude this lecture with one more remark, on the condition of a beam when strained by a transverse force. We have seen that the fibres on the upper surface are compressed, while those on the lower surface are extended; but what is the condition of the fibres in the interior? There can be no doubt that the following is the state of the case:\u2014The fibres immediately beneath the upper surface are in compression; at a greater depth the amount of compression diminishes until at the middle of the beam the fibres are in their natural condition; on approaching the lower surface the fibres commence to be strained in extension, and the amount of the extension gradually increases until it reaches a maximum at the lower surface.[Pg 188]\n\nLECTURE XII.\nTHE STRENGTH OF A BEAM.\nA Beam free at the Ends and loaded in the Middle.\u2014A Beam uniformly loaded.\u2014A Beam loaded in the Middle, whose Ends are secured.\u2014A Beam supported at one end and loaded at the other.\n\nA BEAM FREE AT THE ENDS AND LOADED\nIN THE MIDDLE.\n377. In the preceding lecture we have examined some general circumstances in connection with the condition of a beam acted on by a transverse force; we proceed in the present to inquire more particularly into the strength under these conditions. We shall, as before, use for our experiments rods of pine only, as we wish rather to illustrate the general laws than to determine the strength of different materials. The strength of a beam depends upon its length, breadth, and thickness; we must endeavour to distinguish the effects of each of these elements on the capacity of the beam to sustain its load.\n\nWe shall only employ beams of rectangular section; this being generally the form in which beams of wood are used. Beams of iron, when large, are usually not rectangular, as the material can be more effectively [Pg 189]disposed in sections of a different form. It is important to distinguish between the stiffness of a beam in its capacity to resist flexure, and the strength of a beam in its capacity to resist fracture. Thus the stiffest beam which can be made from the cylindrical trunk of a tree 1' in diameter is 6\" broad and 10\"\u00b75 deep, while the strongest beam is 7\" broad and 9\"\u00b775 deep. We are now discussing the strength (not the stiffness) of beams.\n\n378. We shall commence the inquiry by making a number of experiments: these we shall record in a table, and then we shall endeavour to see what we can learn from an examination of this table. I have here ten pieces of pine, of lengths varying from 1' to 4', and of three different sections, viz. 1\" \u00d7 1\", 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, and 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75. I have arranged four different stands, on which we can break these pieces: on the first stand the distance between the points of support is 40\", and on the other stands the distances are 30,\" 20\", and 10\" respectively; the pieces being 4', 3', 2', and 1' long, will just be conveniently held on the supports.\n\n379. The mode of breaking is as follows:\u2014The beam being laid upon the supports, an S hook is placed at its middle point, and from this S hook the tray is suspended. Weights are then carefully added to the tray until the beam breaks; the load in the tray, together with the weight of the tray, is recorded in the table as the breaking load.\n\n380. In order to guard as much as possible against error, I have here another set of ten pieces of pine, duplicates of the former. I shall also break these; and whenever I find any difference between the breaking loads of two similar beams, I shall record in the table the mean between the two loads. The results are shown in Table XXIV.[Pg 190]\n\nTable XXIV.\u2014Strength of a Beam.\n\nSlips of pine (cut from the same piece) supported freely at each end; the length recorded is the distance between the points of support; the load is suspended from the centre of the beam, and gradually increased until the beam breaks;\n\nFormula, P = 6080 \tarea of section \u00d7 depth\nspan\n\nNumber of\nExperiment. \tDimensions.\tMean of the\n observations of\nthe breaking\nload in lbs.\tP.\nCalculated\n breaking load\nin lbs.\tDifference of\nthe observed\n and calculated\nvalues.\n  Span.  \t Breadth. \t Depth.\n1\t40\"\u00b70\t1\"\u00b70\t1\"\u00b70\t152\u2007\t152\u2007\t\u20070\u00b70\n2\t40\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t1\"\u00b70\t77\t76\t-1\u00b70\n3\t40\"\u00b70\t1\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t38\t38\t\u20070\u00b70\n4\t40\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t0\"\u00b75\t19\t19\t\u20070\u00b70\n5\t30\"\u00b70\t1\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t59\t51\t-8\u00b70\n6\t30\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t0\"\u00b75\t25\t25\t\u20070\u00b70\n7\t20\"\u00b70\t1\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t74\t76\t+2\u00b70\n8\t20\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t0\"\u00b75\t36\t38\t+2\u00b70\n9\t10\"\u00b70\t1\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t154\u2007\t152\u2007\t-2\u00b70\n10\u2007\t10\"\u00b70\t0\"\u00b75\t0\"\u00b75\t68\t76\t+8\u00b70\n\n381. In the first column is a series of figures for convenience of reference. The next three columns are occupied with the dimensions of the beams. By span is meant the distance between the points of support; the real length is of course greater; the depth is that dimension of the beam which is vertical. The fifth column gives the mean of two observations of the breaking load. Thus for example, in experiment No. 5 the two beams used were each 36\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, they were placed on points of support 30\" distant, so the span recorded is 30\": one of the [Pg 191]beams was broken by a load of 58 lbs., and the second by a load of 60 lbs.; the mean between the two, 59 lbs., is recorded as the mean breaking load. In this manner the column of breaking loads has been found. The meaning of the two last columns of the table will be explained presently.\n\n382. We shall endeavour to elicit from these observations the laws which connect the breaking load with the span, breadth, and depth of the beam.\n\n383. Let us first examine the effect of the span; for this purpose we bring together the observations upon beams of the same section, but of different spans. Sections of 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 will be convenient for this purpose; Nos. 4, 6, 8, and 10 are experiments upon beams of this section. Let us first compare 4 and 8. Here we have two beams of the same section, and the span of one (40\") is double that of the other (20\"). When we examine the breaking weights we find that they are 19 lbs. and 36 lbs.; the former of these numbers is rather more than half of the latter. In fact, had the breaking load of 40\" been \u00be lb. less, 18\u00b725 lbs., and had that of 20\" been \u00bd lb. more, 36\u00b75 lbs., one of the breaking loads would have been exactly half the other.\n\n384. We must not look for perfect numerical accuracy in these experiments; we must only expect to meet with approximation, because the laws for which we are in search are in reality only approximate laws. Wood itself is variable in quality, even when cut from the same piece: parts near the circumference are different in strength from those nearer the centre; in a young tree they are generally weaker, and in an old tree generally stronger. Minute differences in the grain, greater or less perfectness in the seasoning, these are also among the circumstances which prevent one piece of timber from being identical [Pg 192]with another. We shall, however, generally find that the effect of these differences is small, but occasionally this is not the case, and in trying many experiments upon the breaking of timber, discrepancies occasionally appear for which it is difficult to account.\n\n385. But you will find, I think, that, making reasonable allowances for such difficulties as do occur, the laws on the whole represent the experiments very closely.\n\n386. We shall, then, assume that the breaking weight of a bar of 40\" is half that of a bar of 20\" of the same section, and we ask, Is this generally true? is it true that the breaking weight is inversely proportional to the span? In order to test this hypothesis, we can calculate the breaking weight of a bar of 30\" (No. 6), and then compare the result with the observed value; if the supposition be true, the breaking weight should be given by the proportion\u2014\n\n30\" : 40\" :: 19 : Answer.\n\nThe answer is 25\u00b73 lbs.; on reference to the table we find 25 lbs. to be the observed value, hence our hypothesis is verified for this bar.\n\n387. Let us test the law also for the 10\" bar, No. 10\u2014\n\n10\" : 40\" :: 19 : Answer.\n\nThe answer in this case is 76, whereas the observed value is 68, or 8 lbs. less; this does not agree very well with the theory, but still the difference, though 8 lbs., is only about 11 or 12 per cent. of the whole, and we shall still retain the law, for certainly there is no other that can express the result as well.\n\n  388. But the table will supply another verification. In experiment No. 3 a 40\" bar, 1\" broad, and 0\"\u00b75 deep, broke with 38 lbs.; and in [Pg 193]experiment No. 7 a 20\" bar of the same section broke with 74 lbs.; but this is so nearly double the breaking weight of the 40\" bar, as to be an additional illustration of the law, that for a given section the breaking load varies inversely as the span.\n\n389. We next inquire as to the effect of the breadth of the beam upon its strength? For this purpose we compare experiments Nos. 3 and 4: we there find that a bar 40\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 is broken by a load of 38 lbs., while a bar just half the breadth is broken by 19 lbs. We might have anticipated this result, for it is evident that the bar of No. 3 must have the same strength as two bars similar to that of No. 4 placed side by side.\n\n390. This view is confirmed by a comparison of Nos. 7 and 8, where we find that a 20\" bar takes twice the load to break it that is required for a bar of half its breadth. The law is not quite so well verified by Nos. 5 and 6, for half the breaking weight of No. 5, namely 29\u00b75 lbs., is more than 25, the observed breaking weight of No. 6: a similar remark may be made about Nos. 9 and 10.\n\n391. Supposing we had a beam of 40\" span, 2\" broad, and 0\"\u00b75 deep, we can easily see that it is equivalent to two bars like that of No. 3 placed side by side; and we infer generally that the strength of a bar is proportional to its breadth; or to speak-more definitely, if two beams have the same span and depth, the ratio of their breaking loads is the same as the ratio of their breadths.\n\n392. We next examine the effect of the depth of a beam upon its strength. In experimenting upon a beam placed edgewise, a precaution must be observed, which would not be necessary if the same beam were to be broken flatwise. When the load is suspended, the beam, if merely laid edgewise on the supports, would almost certainly turn over; it is [Pg 194]therefore necessary to place its extremities in recesses in the supports, which will obviate the possibility of this occurrence; at the same time the ends must not be prevented from bending upwards, for we are at present discussing a beam free at each end, and the case where the ends are not free will be subsequently considered.\n\n  393. Let us first compare together experiments Nos. 2 and 3; here we have two bars of the same dimensions, the section in each being 1\"\u00b70 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, but the first bar is broken edgewise, and the second flatwise. The first breaks with 77 lbs., and the second with 38 lbs.; hence the same bar is twice as strong placed edgewise as flatwise when one dimension of the section is twice as great as the other. We may generalize this law, and assert that the strength of a rectangular beam broken edgewise is to the strength of a beam of like span and section broken flatwise, as the greater dimension of the section is to the lesser dimension.\n\n394. The strength of a beam 40\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 1\" is four times as great as the strength of 40\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, though the quantity of wood is only twice as great in one as in the other. In general we may state that if a beam were bisected by a longitudinal cut, the strength of the beam would be halved when the cut was horizontal, and unaltered when the cut was vertical; thus, for example, two beams of experiment No. 4, placed one on the top of the other, would break with about 40 lbs., whereas if the same rods were in one piece, the breaking load would be nearly 80 lbs.\n\n395. This may be illustrated in a different manner. I have here two beams of 40\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 superposed; they form one beam, equivalent to that of No. 1 in bulk, but I find that they break with 80 lbs., thus showing that the two are only twice as strong as one.\n\n396. I take two similar bars, and, instead of laying them loosely one [Pg 195]on the other, I unite them tightly with iron clamps like those represented in Fig. 56. I now find that the bars thus fastened together require 104 lbs. for fracture. We can readily understand this increase of strength. As soon as the bars begin to bend under the action of the weight, the surfaces which are in contact move slightly one upon the other in order to accommodate themselves to the change of form. By clamping I greatly impede this motion hence the beams deflect less, and require a greater load before they collapse; the case is therefore to some extent approximated to the state of things when the two rods form one solid piece, in which case a load of 152 lbs. would be required to produce fracture.\n\n397. We shall be able by a little consideration to understand the reason why a bar is stronger edgewise than flatwise. Suppose I try to break a bar across my knee by pulling the ends held one in each hand, what is it that resists the breaking? It is chiefly the tenacity of the fibres on the convex surface of the bar. If the bar be edgewise, these fibres are further away from my knee and therefore resist with a greater moment than when the bar is flatwise: nor is the case different when the bar is supported at each end, and the load placed in the centre; for then the reactions of the supports correspond to the forces with which I pulled the ends of the bar.\n\n398. We can now calculate the strength of any rectangular beam of pine:\n\nLet us suppose it to be 12' long, 5\" broad, and 7\" deep. This is five times as strong as a beam 1\" broad and 7\" deep for we may conceive the original beam to consist of 5 of these beams placed side by side (Art 391); the beam 1\" broad and 7\" deep, is 7 times as strong as a beam 7\" broad, 1\" deep (Art. 393). Hence the original beam must be 35 times as [Pg 196]strong as a beam 7\" broad, 1\" deep; but the beam 7\" broad and 1\" deep is seven times stronger than a beam the section of which is 1\" \u00d7 1\", hence the original beam is 245 times as strong as a beam 12' long and 1\" \u00d7 1\" in section; of which we can calculate the strength, by Art. 388, from the proportion\u2014\n\n144\" : 40\" :: 152 : Answer.\n\nThe answer is 42\u00b72 lbs., and thus the breaking load of the original beam is about 10,300 lbs.\n\n399. It will be useful to deduce the general expression for the breaking load of a beam l\" span, b\" broad, and d\" deep, supported freely at the ends and laden in the centre.\n\nLet us suppose a bar l\" long, and 1\" \u00d7 1\" in section. The breaking load is found by the proportion\u2014\n\nl : 40 :: 152 : Answer;\n\nand the result obtained is 6080/l. A beam which is d\" broad, l\" span, and 1\" deep, would be just as strong as d of the beams l\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" placed side by side; of which the collective strength would be\u2014\n\n6080\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\t \u00d7 d.\nl\nIf such a beam, instead of resting flatwise, were placed edgewise, its strength would be increased in the ratio of its depth to its breadth\u2014that is, it would be increased d-fold\u2014and would therefore amount to\n\n6080\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\t \u00d7 d\u00b2.\nl\nWe thus learn the strength of a beam 1\" broad, d\" deep, and l\" span. The strength of b of these beams placed side by side, would be [Pg 197]the same as the strength of one beam b\" broad, d\" deep, and l\" span, and thus we finally obtain\n\n6080\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\t \u00d7 d\u00b2 \u00d7 b.\nl\nSince b d is the area of the section, we can express this result conveniently by saying that the breaking load in lbs. of a rectangular pine beam is equal to\n\n6080 \u00d7 \tarea of section \u00d7 depth\nspan\nthe depth and span being expressed in inches linear measure, and the section in square inches.\n\n400. In order to test this formula, we have calculated from it the breaking loads of all the ten beams given in Table XXIV. and the results are given in the sixth column. The difference between the amount calculated and the observed mean breaking weight is shown in the last column.\n\n401. Thus, for example, in experiment No. 7 the span is 20\", breadth, 1\", depth 0\"\u00b75; the formula gives, since the area is 0\"\u00b75,\n\n \t0\u00b75 \u00d7 0\u00b75\nP  = 6080  \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\t  = 76\n \t20\nThis agrees sufficiently with 74 lbs., the mean of two observed values.\n\n402. Except in experiments Nos. 5 and 10, the differences are very small, and even in these two cases the differences are not sufficient to make us doubt that we have discovered the correct expression for the load generally sufficient to produce fracture.\n\n  403. We have already pointed out that a beam begins to sustain permanent injury when it is subjected to a load greater than half that which would break it (Art. 368), and we may infer that it is not in [Pg 198]general prudent to load a beam which is part of a permanent structure with more than about a third or a fourth of the breaking weight. Hence if we wanted to calculate a fair working load in lbs. for a beam of pine, we might obtain it from the formula.\n\n \tarea of section \u00d7 depth\n1500 \u00d7 \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n \tspan\nProbably a smaller coefficient than 1500 would often be used by the cautious builder, especially when the beam was liable to sudden blows or shocks. The coefficient obtained from small selected rods such as we have used would also be greater than that found from large beams in which imperfections are inevitable.\n\n404. Had we adopted any other kind of wood we should have found a similar formula for the breaking weight, but with a different numerical coefficient. For example, had the beams been made of oak the number 6080 must be replaced by a larger figure.\n\nA BEAM UNIFORMLY LOADED.\n405. We have up to the present only considered the case where the load is suspended from the centre of the beam. But in the actual employment of beams the load is not generally applied in this manner. See in the rafters which support a roof how every inch in the entire length has its burden of slates to bear. The beams which support a warehouse floor have to carry their load in whatever manner the goods are disposed: sometimes, as for example in a grain-store, the pressure will be tolerably uniform along the beams, while if the weights be irregularly scattered on the floor, there will be corresponding inequalities in the mode in which the loads are distributed over the beams. It will therefore be useful for us to examine the strength of a beam when its load is applied otherwise than at the centre.[Pg 199]\n\n  406. We shall employ, in the first place, a beam 40\" span, 0\"\u00b75 broad, and 1\" deep; and we shall break it by applying a load simultaneously at two points, as may be most conveniently done by the contrivance shown in the diagram, Fig. 53. a b is the beam resting on two supports; c and d are the points of trisection of the span; from whence loops descend, which carry an iron bar p q; at the centre r of which a weight w is suspended. The load is thus divided equally between the two points c and d, and we may regard a b as a beam loaded at its two points of trisection. The tray and weights are employed which we have used in the apparatus represented in Fig. 58.\n\n\nFig. 53.\n\n407. We proceed to break this beam. Adding weights to the tray, we see that it yields with 117 lbs., and cracks across between c and d. On reference to Table XXIV. we find from experiment No. 2 that a similar bar was broken by 77 lbs. at the centre; now \u00b3/\u2082 \u00d7 77 = 115\u00b75; hence we may state with sufficient approximation that the bar is half as strong again when the load is suspended from the two points of trisection as it is when suspended from the centre. It is remarkable that in breaking the beam in this manner the fracture is equally likely to occur at any point between c and d.[Pg 200]\n\n  408. A beam uniformly loaded requires twice as much load to break it as would be sufficient if the load were merely suspended from the centre. The mode of applying a load uniformly is shown in Fig. 54.\n\n\nFig. 54.\n\nIn an experiment actually tried, a beam 40\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 1\" placed edgewise was found to support ten 14 lb. weights ranged as in the figure; one or two stone more would, however, doubtless produce fracture.\n\n409. We infer from these considerations that beams loaded in the manner in which they are usually employed are considerably stronger than would be indicated by the results in Table XXIV.\n\nEFFECT OF SECURING THE ENDS OF A BEAM\nUPON ITS STRENGTH.\n410. It has been noticed during the experiments that when the weights are suspended from a beam and the beam begins to deflect, the ends curve upwards from the supports. This bending of the ends is for example shown in Fig. 54. If we restrain the ends of the beam from bending up in this manner, we shall add very considerably to its strength. This we can do by clamping them down to the supports.\n\n  411. Let us experiment upon a beam 40\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\". We clamp each of the [Pg 201]ends and then break the beam by a weight suspended from the centre. It requires 238 lbs. to accomplish fracture. This is a little more than half as much again as 152 lbs., which we find from Table XXIV. was the weight required to break this bar when its ends were free. Calculation shows that the strength of a beam may be even doubled when the ends are kept horizontal by more perfect methods than we have used.\n\n412. When the beam gives way under these circumstances, there is not only a fracture in the centre, but each of the halves are also found to be broken across near the points of support; the necessity for three fractures instead of one explains the increase of strength obtained by restraining the ends to the horizontal direction.\n\n413. In structures the beams are generally more or less secured at each end, and are therefore more capable of bearing resistance than would be indicated by Table XXIV. From the consideration of Arts. 408 and 411, we can infer that a beam secured at each end and uniformly loaded would require three or four times as much load to break it as would be sufficient if the ends were free and if the load were applied at the centre.\n\nBEAMS SECURED AT ONE END AND\nLOADED AT THE OTHER.\n  414. A beam, one end of which is firmly imbedded in masonry or otherwise secured, is occasionally called upon to support a weight suspended from its extremity. Such a beam is shown in Fig. 55.\n\nIn the case we shall examine, a b is a pine beam of dimensions 20\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, and we find that, when w reaches 10 lbs., the beam breaks. In experiment No. 8, Table XXIV., a similar beam [Pg 202]required 36 lbs.; hence we see that the beam is broken in the manner of Fig. 55, by about one-fourth of the load which would have been required if the beam had been supported at each end and laden in the centre.\n\n\nFig. 55.\n\nWe shall presently have occasion to apply some of the results obtained by the experiments made in the lecture now terminated.[Pg 203]\n\nLECTURE XIII.\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF FRAMEWORK.\nIntroduction.\u2014Weight sustained by Tie and Strut.\u2014Bridge with Two Struts.\u2014Bridge with Four Struts.\u2014Bridge with Two Ties.\u2014Simple Form of Trussed Bridge.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n415. In this lecture and the next we shall experiment upon some of the arts of construction. We shall employ slips of pine 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 in section for the purpose of making models of simple framework: these slips can be attached to each other by means of the small clamps about 3\" long, shown in Fig. 56, and the general appearance of the models thus produced may be seen from Figs. 58 and 62.\n\n\nFig. 56.\n\n416. The following experiment shows the tenacity with which these clamps hold. Two slips of pine, each 12\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, are clamped together, so that they overlap about 2\", thus forming a length of 22\": this composite rod is raised by a pulley-block as in Fig. 49, while a load of 2 cwt. is suspended from it. Thus the clamped rods bear a direct [Pg 204]tension of 2 cwt. The efficiency of the clamps depends principally upon friction, aided doubtless by a slight crushing of the wood, which brings the surfaces into perfect contact.\n\n417. These slips of pine united by the clamps are possessed of strength quite sufficient for the experiments now to be described. Models thus constructed have the great advantage of being erected, varied or pulled down, with the utmost facility.\n\nWe have learned that the compressive strength, and, still more, the tensile strength of timber, is much greater than its transverse strength. This principle is largely used in the arts of construction. We endeavour by means of suitable combinations to turn transverse forces into forces of tension or compression, and thus strengthen our constructions. We shall illustrate the mode of doing so by simple forms of framework.\n\nWEIGHT SUSTAINED BY TIE AND STRUT.\n418. We begin with the study of a very simple contrivance, represented in Fig. 57.\n\na b is a rod of pine 20\" long. In the diagram it is represented, for simplicity, imbedded at the end a in the support. In reality, however, it is clamped to the support, and the same remark may be made about some other diagrams used in this lecture. Were a b unsupported except at its end a, it would of course break when a weight of 10 lbs. was suspended at b, as we have already found in Art. 414.\n\n419. We must ascertain whether the transverse force on a b cannot be changed into forces of tension and compression. The tie b c is attached by means of clamps; a b is sustained by this tie; it cannot bend downwards under the action of the weight [Pg 205]w, because we should then require to have on the same base and on the same side of it two triangles having their conterminous sides equal, but this we know from Euclid (I. 7) is impossible. Hence b is supported, and we find that 112 lbs. may be safely suspended, so that the strength is enormously increased. In fact the transverse force is changed into a compressive force or thrust down a b, and a tensile force on b c.\n\n\nFig. 57.\n\n  420. The actual magnitudes of these can be computed. Draw the parallelogram c d e b; if b d represent the weight w, it may be resolved into two forces,\u2014one, b c, a force of extension on the tie; the other, b e, a compressive force on a b, which is therefore a strut. Hence the forces are proportional to the sides of the triangle, a b c. In the present case\n\na b = 20\",  a c = 18\",   b c = 27\";\n\ntherefore, when w is 112 lbs., we calculate that the force on a b is 124 lbs., and on c b 168 lbs. a b would require about 300 lbs. to crush it, and c b about 2,000 lbs. to tear it asunder, consequently the tie and strut can support [Pg 206]1 cwt. with ease. If, however, w were increased to about 270 lbs., the force on a b would become too great, and fracture would arise from the collapse of this strut.\n\n421. When a structure is loaded up to the breaking point of one part, it is proper for economy that all the other parts should be so designed that they shall be as near as possible to their breaking points. In fact, since nothing is stronger than its weakest part, any additional strength which the remaining parts may possess adds no strength to the whole, and is only so much material wasted. Hence our structure would be just as strong, and would be more properly designed if the section of b c were reduced to one-fifth, for the tie would then break when the tension upon it amounted to 400 lbs. When w is 270 lbs. the compression on a b is 300 lbs., and the tension on b c is 405 lbs., so that both tie and strut attain their breaking loads together. The principle of duly apportioning the strength of each piece to the load it has to carry, involves the essence of sound engineering. In that greatest of mechanical feats, the construction of a mighty railway bridge across a wide span, attention to this principle is of vital importance. Such a bridge has to bear the occasional load of a passing train, but it has always to support the far greater load of the bridge materials. There is thus every inducement to make the weight of each part of the bridge as light as may be consistent with safety.\n\nA BRIDGE WITH TWO STRUTS.\n422. We shall next examine the structure of a type of bridge, shown in Fig. 58.[Pg 207]\n\n\nFig. 58.\n\nIt consists of two beams, a b, 4' long, placed parallel to each other at a distance of 3\"\u00b75, and supported at each end; they are firmly clamped to the supports, and a roadway of short pieces is laid upon them. At the points of trisection of the beams c, d, struts c f and d e are clamped, their lower ends being supported by the framework: these struts are 2' long, and there are two of them supporting each of the beams. The tray [Pg 208]g is attached by a chain to a stout piece of wood, which rests upon the roadway at the centre of the bridge.\n\n423. We shall first determine the strength of this bridge by actual experiment, and then we shall endeavour to explain the results in accordance with mechanical principles. We can observe the deflection of the bridge by the cathetometer in the manner already described (Art. 362). By this means we shall ascertain whether the load has permanently injured the elasticity of the structure (Art. 367). We begin by testing the deflection when a load is distributed uniformly, as the weights are disposed in the case of Fig. 62. A cross is marked upon one of the beams, and is viewed in the cathetometer. We arrange 11 stone weights along the bridge, and the cathetometer shows that the deflection is only 0\"\u00b709: the elasticity of the bridge remains unaltered, for when the weights are removed the cross on the beam returns to its original position; hence the bridge is well able to bear this load.\n\n424. We remove the row of weights from the bridge and suspend the tray from the roadway. I take my place at the cathetometer to note the deflection, while my assistant places weights h h on the tray. 1 cwt. being the load, I see that the deflection amounts to 0\"\u00b72; with 2 cwt. the deflection reaches 0\u00b743\"; and the bridge breaks with 238 lbs.\n\n425. Let us endeavour to calculate the additional strength which the struts have imparted to the bridge. By Table XXIV. we see that a rod 40\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 is broken by a load of 19 lbs.: hence the beams of the bridge would have been broken by a load of 38 lbs. if their ends had been free. As, however, the ends of the beams had been clamped down, we learn from Art. 411 that a double load would be necessary. [Pg 209]We may, however, be confident that about 80 lbs. would have broken the unsupported bridge. The strength is, therefore, increased threefold by the struts, for a load of 238 lbs. was required to produce fracture.\n\n426. We might have anticipated this result, because the points c and d being supported by the struts may be considered as almost fixed points; in fact, we see that c cannot descend, because the triangle a c f is unalterable, and for a similar reason d remains fixed: the beam breaks between c and d, and the force required must therefore be sufficient to break a beam supported at the points c and d, whose ends are secured. But c d is one-third of a b, and we have already seen that the strength of a beam is inversely as its length (Art. 388); hence the force required to break the beam when supported by the struts is three times as large as would have been necessary to break the unsupported beam. Thus the strength of the bridge is explained.\n\n427. As a load of 238 lbs. applied near the centre is necessary to break this bridge, it follows from the principle of Art. 408 that a load of about double this amount must be placed uniformly on the roadway before it succumbs; we can, therefore, understand how a load of 11 stone was easily borne (Art 423) without permanent injury to the elasticity of the structure. If we take the factor of safety as 3, we see that a bridge of the form we have been considering may carry, as its ordinary working load, a far greater weight than would have crushed it if unsupported by the struts and with free ends.\n\n428. The strength of the bridge in Fig. 58 is greater in some parts than in others. At the points c and d a maximum load could be borne; the weakest places on the bridge are in the middle [Pg 210]points of the segments a c, d c, and d b. The load applied by the tray was principally borne at the middle of d c, but owing to the piece of wood which sustained the chain being about 18\" long, the load was to some extent distributed.\n\nThe thrust upon the struts is not so easy to calculate accurately. That down c f for example must be less than if the part c d were removed, and half the load were suspended from c. The force in this case can be determined by principles already explained (Art. 420).\n\nA BRIDGE WITH FOUR STRUTS.\n429. The same principles that we have employed in the construction of the bridge of Fig. 58 may be extended further, as shown in the diagram of Fig. 59.\n\n\nFig. 59.\n\nWe have here two horizontal rods, 48\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, each end being secured to the supports; one of these rods is shown in the figure. It is divided into five equal parts in the points b, c, c\u00b4, b\u00b4. We support the rod in these four points by struts, the other extremities of which are fastened to the framework. The points b, c, c\u00b4, b\u00b4 are fixed, as they are sustained by the struts: hence a weight suspended from p, which is to break the bridge, must be sufficiently strong to [Pg 211]break a piece c c\u00b4, which is secured at the ends; the rod a a\u00b4 would have been broken with 38 lbs., hence 190 lbs. would be necessary to break c c\u00b4. There is a similar beam on the other side of the bridge, and therefore to break the bridge 380 lbs. would be necessary, but this force must be applied exactly at the centre of c c\u00b4; and if the weights be spread over any considerable length, a heavier load will be necessary. In fact, if I were to distribute the weight uniformly over the distance c c\u00b4, it appears from Art. 408 that double the load would be necessary to produce fracture.\n\n430. We shall now break this model. I place 18 stone upon it ranged uniformly, and the cathetometer tells me that the bridge only deflects 0\"\u00b71, and that its elasticity is not injured. Placing the tray in position, and loading the bridge by this means, I find with a weight of 2 cwt. that there is a deflection of 0\"\u00b715; with 4 cwt. the deflection amounts to 0'\u00b772. We therefore infer that the bridge is beginning to yield, and the clamps give way when the load is increased to 500 lbs.\n\nA BRIDGE WITH TWO TIES.\n431. It might happen that circumstances would not make it convenient to obtain points of support below the bridge on which to erect the struts. In such a case, if suitable positions for ties can be obtained, a bridge of the form represented in Fig. 60 may be used.\n\na d is a horizontal rod of pine 40\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75; it is trisected in the points b and c, from which points the ties b e and c f are secured to the upper parts of the framework. a d is then supported in the points b and c, which may therefore be regarded as fixed points. Hence, for the reasons we have already explained, the strength of the bridge should be increased nearly threefold. Remembering that the [Pg 212]bridge has two beams we know it would require about 70 lbs. or 80 lbs. to produce fracture without the ties, and therefore we might expect that over 200 lbs. would be necessary when the beams were supported by the ties. I perform the experiment, and you see the bridge yields when the load reaches 194 lbs.: this is somewhat less than the amount we had calculated; the reason being, I think, that one of the clamps slipped before fracture.\n\n\nFig. 60.\n\nA SIMPLE FORM OF TRUSS.\n432. It is often not convenient, or even possible, to sustain a bridge by the methods we have been considering. It is desirable therefore to inquire whether we cannot arrange some plan of strengthening a beam, by giving to it what shall be equivalent to an increase of depth.\n\n433. We shall only be able to describe here some very simple methods for doing this. Superb examples are to be found in railway bridges all over the country, but the full investigation of these complex structures is a problem of no little difficulty, and one into which it [Pg 213]would be quite beyond our province to enter. We shall, however, show how by a judicious combination of several parts a structure can offer sufficient resistance. The most complex lattice girder is little more than a network of ties and struts.\n\n\nFig. 61.\n\n434. Let a b (Fig. 61) be a rod of pine 40\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, secured at each end. We shall suppose that the load is applied at the two points g and h, in the manner shown in the figure. The load which a bridge must bear when a train passes over it is distributed over a distance equal to the length of the train, and the weight of the bridge itself is of course arranged along the entire span; hence the load which a bridge bears is at all times more or less distributed and never entirely concentrated at the centre in the manner we have been considering. In the present experiment we shall apply the breaking load at the two points g and h, as this will be a variation from the mode we have latterly used. e f is an iron bar supported in the loops e g and f h. Let us first try what weight will break the beam. Suspending the tray from e f, I find that a load of 48 lbs. is sufficient; much less would have done had not the ends been clamped. We have already applied a load in this manner in Art. 406.[Pg 214]\n\n435. You observed that the beam, as usual, deflected before it broke; if we could prevent deflection we might reasonably expect to increase the strength. Thus if we support the centre of the beam c, deflection would be prevented. This can be done very simply. We clamp the pieces d a, d b, d c, on a similar beam, and it is evident that c cannot descend so long as the joints at a, b, d, c remain firmly secured. We now find that even with a weight of 112 lbs. in the tray, the bar is unbroken. An arrangement of this kind is frequently employed in engineering, for it seems to be able to bear more than double the load which is sufficient to break the unsupported beam.\n\n\nFig. 62.\n\n436. Two frames of this kind, with a roadway laid between them, would form a bridge, or if the frames were turned upside down they would answer equally well, though of course in this case d a and d b would become ties, and d c a strut, but a better arrangement for a bridge will be next described.[Pg 215]\n\nTHE WYE BRIDGE.\n437. An instructive bridge was erected by the late Sir I. Brunel over the Wye, for the purpose of carrying a railway. The essential parts of the bridge are represented in the model shown in Fig. 62, which as before is made of slips of pine clamped together.\n\n438. Our model is composed of two similar frames, one of which we shall describe, a b is a rod of pine 48\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, supported at each extremity. This rod is sustained at its points of trisection d, c by the uprights d e and c f, while e and f are supported by the rods b e, f e, and a f; the rectangle d e f c is stiffened by the piece c e, and it would be proper in an actual structure to have a piece connecting d and f, but it has not been introduced into the model.\n\n\nFig. 63.\n\n439. We shall understand the use of the diagonal c e by an inspection of Fig. 63. Suppose the quadrilateral a b c d be formed of four pieces of wood hinged at the corners. It is evident that this quadrilateral can be deformed by pressing a and c together, or by pulling them asunder. Even if there were actual joints at the corners, it would be almost impossible to make the quadrilateral stiff by the strength of the joints. You see this by the frame which I hold in my hand; the pieces are clamped together at the corners, but no matter how tightly I compress the clamps, I am able with the slightest exertion to deform the figure.\n\n440. We must therefore look for some method of stiffening the frame. I [Pg 216]have here a triangle of three pieces, which have been simply clamped together at the corners; this triangle is unalterable in form; in fact, since it is impossible to make two different triangles with the same three sides, it is evident the triangle cannot be deformed. This points to a guiding principle in all bridgework. The quadrilateral is not stiff because innumerable different quadrilaterals can be made with the same four sides. But if we draw the diagonal a c of the quadrilateral it is divided into two triangles, and hence when we attach to the quadrilateral, which has been clamped at the four corners, an additional piece in the direction of one of the diagonals, it becomes unalterable in shape.\n\n441. In Fig. 63 we have drawn the two diagonals a c and b d: one would be theoretically sufficient, but it is desirable to have both, and for the following reason. If I pull a and c apart, I stretch the diagonal a c and compress b d. If I compress a and c together, I compress the line a c and extend b d; hence in one of these cases a c is a tie, and in the other it is a strut. It therefore follows that in all cases one of the diagonals is a tie, and the other a strut. If then we have only one diagonal, it is called upon to perform alternately the functions of a tie and of a strut. This is not desirable, because it is evident that a piece which may act perfectly as a tie may be very unsuitable for a strut, and vice vers\u00e2. But if we insert both diagonals we may make both of them ties, or both of them struts, and the frame must be rigid. Thus for example, I might make a c and b d slender bars of wrought iron, which form admirable ties, though quite incapable of acting as struts.\n\n442. What we have said with reference to the necessity for dividing a quadrilateral figure into triangles applies still more to a polygon with a large number of sides, and we may lay down the general principle that every such piece of framework should be composed of triangles.[Pg 217]\n\n443. Returning to Fig. 62, we see the reason why the rectangle e d c f should have one or both of its diagonals introduced. A load placed, for example, at d would tend to depress the piece d e, and thus deform the rectangle, but when the diagonals are introduced this deformation is impossible.\n\n444. Hence one of these frames is almost as strong as a beam supported at the points c and d, and therefore, from the principles of Art. 388, its strength is three times as great as that of an unsupported beam.\n\n445. The two frames placed side by side and carrying a roadway form an admirable bridge, quite independent of any external support, except that given by the piers upon which the extremities of the frames rest. It would be proper to connect the frames together by means of braces, which are not, however, shown in the figure. The model is represented as carrying a uniform load in contradistinction to Fig. 58, where the weight is applied at a single point.\n\n446. With eight stone ranged along it, the bridge of Fig. 62 did not indicate an appreciable deflection.[Pg 218]\n\nLECTURE XIV.\nTHE MECHANICS OF A BRIDGE.\nIntroduction.\u2014The Girder.\u2014The Tubular Bridge.\u2014The Suspension Bridge.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n447. Perhaps it may be thought that the structures we have been lately considering are not those which are most universally used, and that the bridges which are generally referred to as monuments of engineering skill are of quite a different construction. Every one is familiar with the arch, and most of us have seen suspension bridges and the celebrated Menai tube. We must therefore allude further to some of these structures, and this we propose to do in the present lecture. It will only be possible to take a very slight survey of an extensive subject to which elaborate treatises have been devoted.\n\nWe shall first give a brief account of the use of iron in the arts of construction. We shall then explain simply the principle of the tubular bridge, and also of the suspension bridge. The more complex forms are beyond our scope.[Pg 219]\n\nTHE GIRDER.\n448. A horizontal beam supported at each end, and perhaps at intermediate points, and designed to support a heavy load is called a girder. Those rods upon which we have performed experiments, the results of which have been given in Table XXIV., are small girders; but the term is generally understood to relate to structures of iron: the greatest girders for railway bridges are made of bars or plates of iron riveted together.\n\n449. We shall first consider the application of cast iron to girders, and show what form they should assume.\n\n450. A beam of cast iron, supposing its section to be rectangular, has its strength determined by the same laws as the beams of pine. Thus, supposing the section of two beams to be the same, their strengths are inversely proportional to their lengths, and the strength of a beam placed edgewise is to its strength placed flatwise in the proportion of the greater dimension of its section to the less dimension. These laws determine the strength of every rectangular beam of cast iron when that of one beam is known, and we must perform an experiment in order to find the breaking load in a particular case.\n\n451. I take here a piece of cast iron, which is 2' long, and 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 in section. I support this beam at each end upon a frame; the distance between the supports is 20\". I attach the tray to the centre of the beam and load it with weights. The ends of the beam rest freely upon the supports, but I have taken the precaution of tying each end by a piece of wire, so that they may not fly about when the fracture occurs. Loading the tray, I find that with 280 lbs. the crash comes.[Pg 220]\n\n452. Let us compare this result with No. 8 of Table XXIV. (p. 190). There we find that a piece of pine, the same size as the cast iron, was broken with 36 lbs.: the ratio of 280 to 36 is nearly 8, so that the beam of cast iron is about 8 times as strong as the piece of pine of the same size. This result is a little larger than we would have inferred from an examination of tables of the strength of large bars of cast iron; the reason may be that a very small casting, such as this bar, is stronger in proportion than a larger one, owing to the iron not being so uniform throughout the larger mass.\n\n453. I hold here a bar of cast iron 12\" long and 1\" \u00d7 1\" in section. I have not sufficient weights at hand to break it, but we can compute how much would be necessary by our former experiment.\n\n454. In the first place a bar 12\" long, and 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 of section, would require 20 \u00d7 280 \u00f7 12 = 467 lbs. by the law that the strength is inversely as the length. We also know that one beam 12\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" is just as strong as two beams 12\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, each placed edgewise; each of these latter beams is twice as strong as 12\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 placed flatwise, because the strength when placed edgewise is to the strength when placed flatwise, as the depth to the breadth, that is as 2 to 1: hence the original beam is four times as strong as one beam 12\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 placed flatwise: but this last beam is twice as strong as a beam 12\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, and hence we see that a beam 12\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" must be 8 times as strong as a beam of 12\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, but this last beam would require a load of 467 lbs. to break it, and hence the beam of 12\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" would require 467 \u00d7 8 = 3736 lbs. to produce fracture. This amounts to more than a ton and a half.[Pg 221]\n\n455. It is a rule sometimes useful to practical men that a cast iron bar one foot long by one inch square would break with about a ton weight. If the iron be of the same quality as that which we have used, this result is too small, but the error is on the safe side; the real strength will then be generally a little greater than the strength calculated from this rule. What we have said (Art. 403) with reference to the precaution for safety in bars of wood applies also to cast iron. The load which the beam has to bear in ordinary practice should only be a small fraction of that which would break it.\n\n456. In making any description of girder it is desirable on very special grounds that as little material as possible be uselessly employed. It will of course be remembered that a girder has to support its own weight, besides whatever may be placed upon it: and if the girder be massive, its own weight is a serious item. Of two girders, each capable of bearing the same total load, the lighter, besides employing less material, will be able to bear a greater weight placed upon it. It is therefore for a double reason desirable to diminish the weight. This remark applies especially to such a material as cast iron, which can be at once given the form in which it shall be capable of offering the greatest resistance.\n\n457. The principles which will guide us in ascertaining the proper form to give a cast iron girder, are easily deduced from what we have laid down in Lectures XI. and XII. We have seen that depth is very desirable for a strong beam. If therefore we strive to attain great depth in a light beam, the beam must be very thin. Now an extremely thin beam will not be safe. In the first place it would be flexible and liable to displacement sideways; and, in the second place, there is a still more fatal difficulty. We [Pg 222]have shown that when a beam of wood is supporting a weight, the fibres at the bottom of the beam are extended, the tendency being to tear them (Art. 376). The fibres on the top of the beam are compressed, while the centre of the beam is in its natural state. The condition of strain in a cast iron beam is precisely similar; the bottom portions are in a state of extension, while the top is compressed. If therefore a beam be very thin, the material at the lower part may not be sufficient to withstand the forces of extension, and fracture is produced. To obviate this, we strengthen the bottom of the beam by placing extra material there. Thus we are led to the idea of a thin beam with an excess of iron at the bottom.\n\n\nFig. 64.\n\n458. e f (Fig. 64) is the thin iron beam along the bottom of which is the stout flange shown at c d; rupture cannot commence at the bottom unless this flange be torn asunder; for until this happens it is clear that fracture cannot begin to attack the upper and slender part of the beam e f.\n\n459. But the beam is in a state of compression along its upper side, just as in the wooden beams which we have already considered. If therefore the upper parts were not powerful enough to resist this compression, they would be crushed, and the beam would give way. The remedy for this source of weakness is obvious; a second flange runs along the top of the beam, as shown at a b. If this be strong enough to resist the compression, the stability of the beam is ensured.[Pg 223]\n\n460. The upper flange is made very much smaller than the lower one, in consequence of a property of cast iron. This metal is more capable of resisting forces of compression than forces of extension, and it is only necessary to use one-sixth of the iron on the upper flange that is required for the lower. When the section has been thus proportioned, the beam is equally strong at both top and bottom; adding material to either flange without strengthening the other, will not benefit the girder, but will rather prove a source of weakness, by increasing the weight which has to be supported.\n\n461. I have here a small girder made of what we are familiar with under the name of \u201ctin,\u201d but which is of course sheet iron thinly covered over with tin. It has the shape shown in Fig. 64, and it is 12\" long. I support it at each end, and you see it bears two hundred weight without apparent deflection.\n\nTHE TUBULAR BRIDGE.\n462. I shall commence the description of the principle of this bridge by performing some experiments upon a tube, which I hold in my hand. The tube is square, 1\" \u00d7 1\" in section, and 38\" long. It is made of \u201ctin,\u201d and weighs rather less than a pound.\n\n463. Here is a solid rod of iron of the same length as the tube, but containing considerably more metal. This is easily verified by weighing the tube and the rod one against the other. I shall regard them as two girders, and experiment upon their strength, and we shall find that, though the tube contains less substance than the rod, it is much the stronger.\n\n464. I place the rod on a pair of supports about 3' apart; I then attach the tray to the middle of the rod: 14 lbs. produce a deflection of 0\"\u00b751, and 42 lbs. bends down the rod through 3\"\u00b718. This is a large [Pg 224]deflection; and when I remove the load, the rod only returns through 1\"\u00b778, thus showing that a permanent deflection of 1\"\u00b740 is produced. This proves that the rod is greatly injured, and demonstrates its unsuitability for a girder.\n\n465. Next we place the tube upon the same supports, and treat it in the same manner. A load of 56 lbs. only produces a deflection of 0\"\u00b709, and, when this load is removed, the tube returns to its original position: this is shown by the cathetometer, for a cross is marked on the tube, and I bring the image of it on the horizontal wire of the telescope before the load of 56 lbs. is placed in the tray. When the load is removed, I see that the cross returns exactly to where it was before, thus proving that the elasticity of the tube is unimpaired. We double the load, thus placing 1 cwt. in the tray, the deflection only reaches 0\"\u00b726, and, when the load is removed, the tube is found to be permanently deflected by a quantity, at all events not greater than 0\"\u00b7004; hence we learn that the tube bears easily and without injury a load more than twice as great as that which practically destroyed a rod of wrought iron, containing more iron than the tube. We load the tube still further by placing additional weights in the tray, and with 140 lbs. the tube breaks; the fracture has occurred at a joint which was soldered, and the real breaking strength of the tube, had it been continuous, is doubtless far greater. Enough, however, has been borne to show the increase of strength obtained by the tubular form.\n\n466. We can explain the reason of this remarkable result by means of Fig. 64. Were the thin portion of the girder e f made of two parts placed side by side, the strength would not be altered. If we then imagine the flange a b widened to the width of c d, and the two parts which form e f [Pg 225]opened out so as to form a tube, the strength of the girder is still retained in its modified form.\n\n467. A tube of rectangular section has the advantage of greater depth than a solid rod of the same weight; and if the bottom of the tube be strong enough to resist the extension, and the top strong enough to resist the compression, the girder will be stiff and strong.\n\n468. In the Menai Tubular Bridge, where a gigantic tube supported at each end bridges over a span of four hundred and sixty feet, special arrangements have been made for strengthening the top. It is formed of cells, as wrought iron disposed in this way is especially adapted for resisting compression.\n\n469. We have only spoken of rectangular tubes, but it is equally true for tubes of circular or other sections that when suitably constructed they are stronger than the same quantity of material, if made into a solid rod.\n\n470. We find this principle in nature; bones and quills are often found to be hollow in order to combine lightness with strength, and the stalks of wheat and other plants are tubular for the same reason.\n\nTHE SUSPENSION BRIDGE.\n471. Where a great span is required, the suspension bridge possesses many advantages. It is lighter than a girder bridge of the same span, and consequently cheaper, while its singular elegance contrasts very favourably with the appearance of more solid structures. On the other hand, a suspension bridge is not so well suited for railway traffic as the lattice girder.\n\n472. The mechanical character of the suspension bridge is simple. If a rope or a chain be suspended from two points to which its ends are [Pg 226]attached, the chain hangs in a certain curve known to mathematicians as the catenary. The form of the catenary varies with the length of the rope, but it would not be possible to make the chain lie in a straight line between the two points of support, for reasons pointed out in Art. 20. No matter how great be the force applied, it will still be concave. When the chain is stretched until the depression in the middle is small compared with the distance between the points of support, the curve though always a catenary, has a very close resemblance to the parabola.\n\n473. In Fig. 65 a model of a suspension bridge is shown. The two chains are fixed one on each side at the points e and f; they then pass over the piers a, d, and bridge a span of nine feet. The vertical line at the centre b c shows the greatest amount by which the chain has deflected from the horizontal a d. When the deflection of the middle of the chain is about one-tenth part of a d, the curve a c d becomes for all practical purposes a parabola. The roadway is suspended by slender iron rods from the chains, the lengths of the suspension rods being so regulated as to make it nearly horizontal.\n\n474. The roadway in the model is laden with 8 stone weights. We have distributed them in this manner in order to represent the permanent load which a great suspension bridge has to carry. The series of weights thus arranged produces substantially the same effect as if it were actually distributed uniformly along the length. In a real suspension bridge the weight of the chain itself adds greatly to the tension.\n\n475. We assume that the chain hangs in the form of a parabola, and that the load is uniformly ranged along the bridge. The tension upon the chains is greatest at their highest points, and least at their lowest points, though the difference is small. The amount of the tension can be calculated when the load, span, and deflection are known. We cannot give the steps of the calculation, but we shall enunciate the result.[Pg 227]\n\n\nFig. 65.\n\n[Pg 228]476. The magnitude of the tension at the lowest point c of each chain is found by multiplying the total weight (including chains, suspension rods, and roadway) by the span, and dividing the product by sixteen times the deflection.\n\nThe tension of the chain at the highest point a exceeds that at the lowest point c, by a weight found by multiplying the total load by the deflection, and dividing the product by twice the span.\n\n477. The total weight of roadway, chains, and load in the model is 120 lbs.; the deflection is 10\", the span 108\"; the product of the weight and span is 12,960; sixteen times the deflection is 160; and, therefore, the tension at the point c is found, by dividing 12,960 by 160, to be 81 lbs.\n\nTo find the tension at the point a, we multiply 120 by 10, and divide the product by 216; the quotient is nearly 6. This added to 81 lbs. gives 87 lbs. for the tension on the chain at a.\n\n478. One chain of the model is attached to a spring balance at a; by reference to the scale we see the tension indicated to be 90 lbs.: a sufficiently close approximation to the calculated tension of 87 lbs.\n\n479. A large suspension bridge has its chains strained by an enormous force. It is therefore necessary that the ends of these chains be very firmly secured. A good attachment is obtained by anchoring the chain to a large iron anchor imbedded in solid rock.\n\n480. In Art. 45 we have pointed out how the dimensions of the tie rod [Pg 229]could be determined when the tension was known. Similar considerations will enable us to calculate the size of the chain necessary for a suspension bridge when we have ascertained the tension to which it will be subjected.\n\n481. We can easily determine by trial what effect is produced on the tension of the chain, by placing a weight upon the bridge in addition to the permanent load. Thus an additional stone weight in the centre raises the tension of the spring balance to 100 lbs.; of course the tension in the other chain is the same: and thus we find a weight of 14 lbs. has produced additional tensions of 10 lbs. each in the two chains. With a weight of 28 lbs. at the centre we find a strain of 110 lbs. on the chain.\n\n482. These additional weights may be regarded as analogous to the weights of the vehicles which the suspension bridge is required to carry. In a large suspension bridge the tension produced by the passing loads is only a small fraction of the permanent load.[Pg 230]\n\nLECTURE XV.\nTHE MOTION OF A FALLING BODY.\nIntroduction.\u2014The First Law of Motion.\u2014The Experiment of Galileo from the Tower of Pisa.\u2014The Space is proportional to the Square of the Time.\u2014A Body falls 16' in the First Second.\u2014The Action of Gravity is independent of the Motion of the Body.\u2014How the Force of Gravity is defined.\u2014The Path of a Projectile is a Parabola.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n483. Kinetics is that branch of mechanics which treats of the action of forces in the production of motion. We shall find it rather more difficult than the subjects with which we have been hitherto occupied; the difficulties in kinetics arise from the introduction of the element of time, into our calculations. The principles of kinetics were unknown to the ancients. Galileo discovered some of its truths in the seventeenth century; and, since his time, the science has grown rapidly. The motion of a falling body was first correctly apprehended by Galileo; and with this subject we can appropriately commence.\n\nTHE FIRST LAW OF MOTION.\n484. Velocity, in ordinary language, is supposed to convey a notion of [Pg 231]rapid motion. Such is not precisely the meaning of the word in mechanics. By velocity is merely meant the rate at which a body moves, whether the rate be fast or be slow. This rate is most conveniently measured by the number of feet moved over in one second. Hence when it is said the velocity of a body is 25, it is meant that if the body continued to move for one second with its velocity unaltered, it would in that time have moved over 25 feet.\n\n\nFig. 66.\n\n  485. The first law of motion may be stated thus. If no force act upon a body, it will, if at rest, remain for ever at rest; or if in motion, it will continue for ever to move with a uniform velocity. We know this law to be true, and yet no one has ever seen it to be true for the simple reason that we cannot realise the condition which it requires. We cannot place a body in the condition of being unacted upon by any forces. But we may convince ourselves of the truth of the law by some such reasoning as the following. If a stone be thrown along the road, it soon comes to rest. The body leaves the hand with a certain initial velocity and is not further acted upon by it. Hence, if no other force acted on the stone, we should expect, if the first law be true, that it would continue to run on for ever with the original velocity at the moment of leaving the hand. But other forces do act upon the stone; the attraction of the earth pulls it down; and, when it begins to bound and roll upon the ground, friction comes into operation, deprives the stone of its velocity, and brings it to rest. But let the stone be thrown upon a surface of smooth ice; when it begins to slide, the force of gravity is counteracted by the reaction of the ice: there is no other force acting upon the stone except friction, which is small. Hence we find that the stone will run on for a considerable distance. It requires but little effort of the imagination to suppose a lake whose [Pg 232]surface is an infinite plane, perfectly smooth, and that the stone is perfectly smooth also. In such a case as this the first law of motion amounts to the assertion that the stone would never stop.\n\n486. We may, in the lecture room, see the truth of this law verified to a certain extent by Atwood's machine (Fig, 66). This machine has been devised for the purpose of investigating the laws of motion by actual experiment. It consists principally of a pulley c, mounted so that its axle rests upon two pairs of wheels, as shown in the figure; it being the object of this contrivance to enable the wheel to revolve with the utmost freedom. A pair of equal weights a, b, are attached by a silken thread, which passes over the pulley; each of the weights is counterbalanced by the other: so that [Pg 233]when the two are in motion, we may consider either as a body not acted upon by any forces, and it will be found that it moves uniformly, as far as the size of the apparatus will permit.\n\n487. If we try to conceive a body free in space, and not acted upon by any force, it is more natural to suppose that such a body, when once started, should go on moving uniformly for ever, than that its velocity should be altered. The true proof of the first law of motion is, that all consequences properly deduced from it, in combination with other principles, are found to be verified. Astronomy presents us with the best examples. The calculation of the time of an eclipse is based upon laws which in themselves assume the first law of motion; hence, when we invariably find that an eclipse occurs precisely at the moment for which it has been predicted, we have a splendid proof of the sublime truth which the first law of motion expresses.\n\nTHE EXPERIMENT OF GALILEO\nFROM THE TOWER OF PISA.\n488. The contrast between heavy bodies and light bodies is so marked that without trial we hardly believe that a heavy body and a light body will fall from the same height in the same time. That they do so Galileo proved by dropping a heavy ball and a light ball together from the top of the Leaning Tower at Pisa. They were found to reach the ground simultaneously. We shall repeat this experiment on a scale sufficiently reduced to correspond with the dimensions of the lecture room.[Pg 234]\n\n\nFig. 67.\n\n[Pg 235]  489. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 67. It consists of a stout framework supporting a pulley h at a height of about 20 feet above the ground. This pulley carries a rope; one end of the rope is attached to a triangular piece of wood, to which two electro-magnets g are fastened. The electro-magnet is a piece of iron in the form of a horse-shoe, around which is coiled a long wire. The horse-shoe becomes a magnet immediately an electric current passes through the wire; it remains a magnet as long as the current passes, and returns to its original condition the moment the current ceases. Hence, if I have the means of controlling the current, I have complete control of the magnet; you see this ball of iron remains attached to the magnet as long as the current passes, but drops the instant I break the current. The same electric circuit includes both the magnets; each of them will hold up an iron ball f when the current passes, but the moment the current is broken both balls will be released. Electricity travels along a wire with prodigious velocity. It would pass over many thousands of miles in a second; hence the time that it takes to pass through the wires we are employing is quite inappreciable. A piece of thin paper interposed between the magnets and the balls will ensure that they are dropped simultaneously; when this precaution is not taken one or both balls may hesitate a little before commencing to descend. A long pair of wires e, b, must be attached to the magnets, the other ends of the wires communicating with the battery d; the triangle and its load is hoisted up by means of the rope and pulley and the magnets thus carry the balls to a height of 20 feet: the balls we are using weigh about 0\u00b725 lb. and 1 lb. respectively.\n\n490. We are now ready to perform the experiment. I break the circuit; the two balls are disengaged simultaneously; they fall side by side the whole way, and reach the ground together, where it is well to place a [Pg 236]cushion to receive them. Thus you see the heavy ball and the light one each require the same amount of time to fall from the same height.\n\n  491. But these balls are both of iron; let us compare together balls made of different substances, iron and wood for example. A flat-headed nail is driven into a wooden ball of about 2\"\u00b75 in diameter, and by means of the iron in the nail I can suspend this ball from one of the magnets; while either of the iron balls we have already used hangs from the other. I repeat the experiment in the same manner, and you see they also fall together. Finally, when an iron ball and a cork ball are dropped, the latter is within two or three inches of its weighty companion when the cushion is reached: this small difference is due to the greater effect of the resistance of the air on the lighter of the two bodies. There can be no doubt that in a vacuum all bodies of whatever size or material would fall in precisely the same time.\n\n492. How is the fact that all bodies fall in the same time to be explained? Let us first consider two iron balls. Take two equal particles of iron; it is evident that these fall in the same time; they would do so if they were very close together, even if they were touching, but then they might as well be in one piece: and thus we should find that a body consisting of two or more iron particles takes the same time to fall as one (omitting of course the resistance of the air). Thus it appears most reasonable that two balls of iron, even though unequal in size, should fall in the same time.\n\n493. The case of the wooden ball and the iron ball will require more consideration before we realise thoroughly how much Galileo\u2019s experiment proves. We must first explain the meaning of the word mass in mechanics.[Pg 237]\n\n494. It is not correct to define mass by the introduction of the idea of weight, because the mass of a body is something independent of the existence of the earth, whereas weight is produced by the attraction of the earth. It is true that weight is a convenient means of measuring mass, but this is only a consequence of the property of gravity which the experiment proves, namely, that the attraction of gravity for a body is proportional to its mass.\n\n495. Let us select as the unit of mass the mass of a piece of platinum which weighs 1 lb. at London; it is then evident that the mass of any other piece of platinum should be expressed by the number of pounds it contains: but how are we to determine the mass of some other substance, such as iron? A piece of iron is defined to have the same mass as a piece of platinum, if the same force acting on either of the bodies for the same time produces the same velocity. This is the proper test of the equality of masses. The mass of any other piece of iron will be represented by the number of times it contains a piece equal to that which we have just compared with the platinum; similarly of course for other substances.\n\n496. The magnitude of a force acting for the time unit is measured by the product of the mass set in motion and the velocity which it has acquired. This is a truth established, like the first law of motion, by indirect evidence.\n\n 497. Let us apply these principles to explain the experiment which demonstrated that a ball of wood and a ball of iron fall in the same time. Forces act upon the two bodies for the same time, but the magnitudes of the forces are proportional to the mass of each body multiplied into its velocity, and, since the bodies fall simultaneously, their velocities are equal. The forces acting upon the bodies are therefore proportional to their masses; but the force acting [Pg 238]on each body is the attraction of the earth, therefore, the gravitation to the earth of different bodies is proportional to their masses.\n\n498. We may here note the contrast between the attraction of gravitation and that of a magnet. A magnet attracts iron powerfully and wood not at all; but the earth draws all bodies with forces depending on their masses and their distances, and not on their chemical composition.\n\nTHE SPACE DESCRIBED BY A FALLING BODY IS\nPROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE OF THE TIME.\n499. We have next to discover the law by which we ascertain the distance a body falling from rest will move in a given time; it is not possible to experiment directly upon this subject, as in two seconds a body will drop 64 feet and acquire an inconveniently large velocity; we can, however, resort to Atwood\u2019s machine (Fig. 66) as a means of diminishing the motion. For this purpose we require a clock with a seconds pendulum.\n\n500. On one of the equal cylinders a I place a slight brass rod, whose weight gives a preponderance to a, which will consequently descend. I hold the loaded weight in my hand, and release it simultaneously with the tick of the pendulum. I observe that it descends 5\" before the next tick. Returning the weight to the place from whence it started, I release it again, and I find that at the second tick of the pendulum it has travelled 20\". Similarly we find that in three seconds it descends 45\". It greatly facilitates these experiments to use a little stage which is capable of being slipped up and down the scale, and which can be clamped to the scale in any position. By actually placing the stage at the distance of 5\", 20\", or 45\" below the point from which the weight starts, the coincidence of [Pg 239]the tick of the pendulum with the tap of the weight on its arrival at the stage is very marked.\n\n501. These three distances are in the proportion of 1, 4, 9; that is, as the squares of the numbers of seconds 1, 2, 3. Hence we may infer that the distance traversed by a body falling from rest is proportional to the square of the time.\n\n502. The motion of the bodies in Atwood\u2019s machine is much slower than the motion of a body falling freely, but the law just stated is equally true in both cases so that in a free fall the distance traversed is proportional to the square of the time. Atwood\u2019s machine cannot directly tell us the distance through which a body falls in one second. If we can find this by other means, we shall easily be able to calculate the distance through which a body will fall in any number of seconds.\n\nA BODY FALLS 16' IN THE FIRST SECOND.\n503. The apparatus by which this important truth maybe demonstrated is shown in Fig. 67. A part of it has been already employed in performing the experiment of Galileo, but two other parts must now be used which will be briefly explained.\n\n504. At a a pendulum is shown which vibrates once every second; it need not be connected with any clockwork to sustain the motion, for when once set vibrating it will continue to swing some hundreds of times. When this pendulum is at the middle of its swing, the bob just touches a slender spring, and presses it slightly downwards. The electric current which circulates about the magnets g (Art. 489) passes through this spring when in its natural position; but when the spring is pressed down by the pendulum, [Pg 240]the current is interrupted. The consequence is that, as the pendulum swings backwards and forwards, the current is broken once every second. There is also in the circuit an electric alarm bell c, which is so arranged that, when the current passes, the hammer is drawn from the bell; but, when the current ceases, a spring forces the hammer to strike the bell. When the circuit is closed, the hammer is again drawn back. The pendulum and the bell are in the same circuit, and thus every vibration of the pendulum produces a stroke of the bell. We may regard the strokes from the bell as the ticks of the pendulum rendered audible to the whole room.\n\n505. You will now understand the mode of experimenting. I draw the pendulum aside so that the current passes uninterruptedly. An iron ball is attached to one of the electro-magnets, and it is then gently hoisted up until the height of the ball from the ground is about 16'. A cushion is placed on the floor in order to receive the falling body. You are to look steadily at the cushion while you listen for the bell. All being ready, the pendulum, which has been held at a slight inclination, is released. The moment the pendulum reaches the middle of its swing it touches the spring, rings the bell, breaks the current which circulated around the magnet, and as there is now nothing to sustain the ball, it drops down to the cushion; but just as it arrives there, the pendulum has a second time broken the electric circuit, and you observe the falling of the ball upon the cushion to be identical with the second stroke of the bell. As these strokes are repeated at intervals of a second, it follows that the ball has fallen 16' in one second. If the magnet be raised a few feet higher, the ball may be seen to reach the cushion after the bell is heard. If the magnet be lowered a few feet, the ball reaches the cushion before the bell is heard.[Pg 241]\n\n506. We have previously shown that the space is proportional to the square of the time. We now see that when the time is one second, the space is 16 feet. Hence if the time were two seconds, the space would be 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 feet; and in general the space in feet is equal to 16 multiplied by the square of the time in seconds.\n\n507. By the help of this rule we are sometimes enabled to ascertain the height of a perpendicular cliff, or the depth of a well. For this purpose it is convenient to use a stop-watch, which will enable us to measure a short interval of time accurately. But an ordinary watch will do nearly as well, for with a little practice it is easy to count the beats, which are usually at the rate of five a second. By observing the number of beats from the moment the stone is released till we see or hear its arrival at the bottom, we determine the time occupied in the act of falling. The square of the number of seconds (taking account of fractional parts) multiplied by 16 gives the depth of the well or the height of the cliff in feet, provided it be not high.\n\nTHE ACTION OF GRAVITY IS INDEPENDENT\nOF THE MOTION OF THE BODY.\n508. We have already learned that the effect of gravity does not depend upon the actual chemical composition of the body. We have now to learn that its effect is uninfluenced by any motion which the body may possess. Gravity pulls a body down 16' per second, if the body starts from rest. But suppose a stone be thrown upwards with a velocity of 20 feet, where will it be at the end of a second? Did gravity not act upon the stone, it would be at a height of 20 feet. The principle we have stated tells us that gravity will draw this stone towards the earth [Pg 242]through a distance of 16', just as it would have done if the stone had started from rest. Since the stone ascends 20' in consequence of its own velocity, and is pulled back 16' by gravity, it will, at the end of a second, be found at the height of 4'. If, instead of being shot up vertically, the body had been projected in any other direction, the result would have been the same; gravity would have brought the body at the end of one second 16' nearer the earth than it would have been had gravity not acted. For example, if a body had been shot vertically downwards with a velocity of 20', it would in one second have moved through a space of 36'.\n\n509. We shall illustrate this remarkable property by an experiment. The principle of doing so is as follows:\u2014Suppose we take two bodies, a and b. If these be held at the same height, and released together, of course they reach the ground at the same instant; but if a, instead of being merely dropped, be projected with a horizontal velocity at the same moment that b is released, it is still found that a and b strike the floor simultaneously.\n\n510. You may very simply try this without special apparatus. In your left hand hold a marble, and drop it at the same instant that your right hand throws another marble horizontally. It will be seen that the two marbles reach the ground together.\n\n511. A more accurate mode of making the experiment is shown by the contrivance of Fig. 68.[Pg 243]\n\n\nFig. 68.\n\nIn this we have an arrangement by which we ensure that one ball shall be released just as the other is projected. At a b is shown a piece of wood about 2\" thick; the circular portion (2' radius) on which the ball rests is grooved, so that the ball only touches the two edges and not the bottom of the groove. Each edge of the groove is covered with tinfoil c, but the pieces of tinfoil on the two sides must not communicate. One edge is connected with one pole of the battery k, and the other edge with the other pole, but the current is unable to pass until a communication by a conductor is opened between the two edges. The ball g supplies the bridge; it is covered with tinfoil, and therefore, as long as it rests upon the edges, the circuit is complete; the groove is so placed that the tangent to it at the lowest point b is horizontal, and therefore, when the ball rolls down the curve, it is projected from the bottom in a horizontal direction. An india-rubber spring is used to propel the ball; and by drawing it back when embraced by the spring, I [Pg 244]can communicate to the missile a velocity which can be varied at pleasure. At h we have an electro-magnet, the wire around which forms part of the circuit we have been considering. This magnet is so placed that a ball suspended from it is precisely at the same height above the floor as the tinned ball is at the moment when it leaves the groove.\n\n512. We now understand the mode of experimenting. So long as the tinned ball g remains on the curve the bridge is complete, the current passes, and the electro-magnet will sustain h, but the moment g leaves the curve, h is allowed to fall. We invariably find that whatever be the velocity with which g is projected, it reaches the ground at the same instant as h arrives there. Various dotted lines in the figure show the different paths which g may traverse; but whether it fall at d, at e, or at f, the time of descent is the same as that taken by h. Of course, if g were not projected horizontally, we should not have arrived at this result; all we assert is that whatever be the motion of a body, it will (when possible) be at the end of a second, sixteen feet nearer the earth than it would have been if gravity had not acted. If the body be projected horizontally, its descent is due to gravity alone, and is neither accelerated nor retarded by the horizontal velocity. What this experiment proves is, that the mere fact of a body having velocity does not affect the action of gravity thereon.\n\n513. Though we have only shown that a horizontal velocity does not affect the action of gravity, yet neither does a velocity in any direction. This is verified, like the first law of motion, by the accordance between the consequences deduced from it and the facts of observation.\n\n514. We may summarize these results by saying that no matter what be the material of which a particle is composed, whether it be heavy or [Pg 245]light, moving or at rest, if no force but gravity act upon the particle for t seconds, it will then be 16t\u00b2 feet nearer the earth than it would have been had gravity not acted.\n\n\nFig. 69.\n\n  515. A proposition which is of some importance may be introduced here. Let us suppose a certain velocity and a certain force. Let the velocity be such that a point starting from a, Fig. 69, would in one second move uniformly to b. Let the force be such that if it acted on a particle originally at rest at a, it would in one second draw the particle to d; if then the force act on a particle having this velocity where will it be at the end of the second? Complete the parallelogram a b c d, and the particle will be found at c. By what we have stated the force will equally discharge its duty whatever be the initial velocity. The force will therefore make the particle move to a distance equal and parallel to a d from whatever position the particle would have assumed, had the force not acted; but had the force not acted, the particle would have been found at b: hence, when the force does act, the particle must be found at c, since b c is equal and parallel to a d.[Pg 246]\n\nHOW THE FORCE OF GRAVITY IS DEFINED.\n516. From the formula\n\nDistance = 16t\u00b2,\n\nwe learn that a body falls through 64' in 2 seconds; and as we know that it falls 16' in the first second, it must fall 48' in the next second. Let us examine this. After falling for one second, the body acquires a certain velocity, and with that velocity it commences the next second. Now, according to what we have just seen, gravity will act during the next second quite independently of whatever velocity the body may have previously had. Hence in the second second gravity pulls the body down 16', but the body moves altogether through 48'; therefore it must move through 32' in consequence of the velocity which has been impressed upon it by gravity during the first second. We learn by this that when gravity acts for a second, it produces a velocity such that, if the body be conceived to move uniformly with the velocity acquired, the body would in one second move over 32'.\n\n517. In three seconds the body falls 144', therefore in the third second it must have fallen\n\n144' - 64' = 80';\n\nbut of this 80' only 16' could be due to the action of gravity impressed during that second; the rest,\n\n80' - 16' = 64',\n\nis due to the velocity with which the body commenced the third second.\n\n518. We see therefore that after the lapse of two seconds gravity has communicated to the body a velocity of 64' per second; we should similarly find, that at the end of the third second, the body has a [Pg 247]velocity of 96', and in general at the end of t seconds a velocity of 32t. Thus we illustrate the remarkable law that the velocity developed by gravity is proportional to the time.\n\n519. This law points out that the most suitable way of measuring gravity is by the velocity acquired by a falling body at the end of one second. Hence we are accustomed to say that g (as gravity is generally designated) is 32. We shall afterwards show in the lecture on the pendulum (XVIII.) how the value of g can be obtained accurately. From the two equations, v = 32t and s = 16t\u00b2 it is easy to infer another very well known formula, namely, v\u00b2 = 64s.\n\nTHE PATH OF A PROJECTILE IS A PARABOLA.\n520. We have already seen, in the experiments of Fig. 68, that a body projected horizontally describes a curved path on its way to the ground, and we have to determine the geometrical nature of the curve. As the movement is rapid, it is impossible to follow the projectile with the eye so as to ascertain the shape of its path with accuracy; we must therefore adopt a special contrivance, such as that represented in Fig. 70.\n\nb c is a quadrant of wood 2\" thick; it contains a groove, along which the ball b will run when released. A series of cardboard hoops are properly placed on a black board, and the ball, when it leaves the quadrant, will pass through all these hoops without touching any, and finally fall into a basket placed to receive it. The quadrant must be secured firmly, and the ball must always start from precisely the same place. The hoops are easily adjusted by trial. Letting the ball run down the quadrant two or three times, we can see how to place the first hoop in its right position, and secure it by [Pg 248]drawing pins; then by a few more trials the next hoop is to be adjusted, and so on for the whole eight.\n\n521. The curved line from the bottom of the quadrant, which passes through the centres of the hoops, is the path in which the ball moves; this curve is a parabola, of which f is the focus and the line a a the directrix.\n\n\nFig. 70.\n\nIt is a property of the parabola that the distance of any point on the curve from the focus is equal to its perpendicular distance from the directrix. This is shown in the figure. For example, the dotted line [Pg 249]f d, drawn from f to the centre of the lowest hoop d, is equal in length to the perpendicular d p let fall from d on the directrix a a.\n\n522. The direction in which the ball is projected is in this case horizontal, but, whatever be the direction of projection, the path is a parabola. This can be proved mathematically as a deduction from the theorem of Art. 515.[Pg 250]\n\nLECTURE XVI.\nINERTIA.\nInertia.\u2014The Hammer.\u2014The Storing of Energy.\u2014The Fly-wheel.\u2014The Punching Machine.\n\nINERTIA.\n523. A body unacted upon by force will continue for ever at rest, or for ever moving uniformly in a straight line. This is asserted by the first law of motion (Art. 485). It is usual to say that Inertia is a property of all matter, by which it is meant that matter cannot of itself change its state of rest or of motion. Force is accordingly required for this purpose. In the present chapter we shall discuss some important mechanical considerations connected with the application of force in changing the state of a body from rest or in altering its velocity when in motion. In the next chapter we shall study the application of force in compelling a body to swerve from its motion in a straight line.\n\n524. We have in earlier lectures been concerned with the application of force either to raise a weight or to overcome friction. We have now to [Pg 251]consider the application of force to a body, not for the purpose of raising it, nor for pushing it along against a frictional resistance, but merely for the purpose of generating a velocity. Unfortunately there is a practical difficulty in the way of making the experiments precisely in the manner we should wish. We want to get a mass isolated both from gravitation and from friction, but this is just what we cannot do\u2014that is, we cannot do it perfectly. We have, however, a simple appliance which will be sufficiently isolated for our present purpose. Here is a heavy weight of iron, about 25 lbs., suspended by an iron wire from the ceiling about 32 feet above the floor (see Fig. 82). This weight may be moved to and fro by the hand. It is quite free from friction, for we need not at present remember the small resistance which the air offers. We may also regard the gravity of the weight as neutralized by the sustaining force of the wire, and accordingly as the body now hangs at rest it may for our purposes be regarded as a body unacted upon by any force.\n\n525. To give this ball a horizontal velocity I feel that I must apply force to it. This will be manifest to you all when I apply the force through the medium of an india-rubber spring. If I pull the spring sharply you notice how much it stretches; you see therefore that the body will not move quickly unless a considerable force is applied to it. It thus follows that merely to generate motion in this mass force has been required.\n\n526. So, too, when the body is in motion as it now is I cannot stop it without the exertion of force. See how the spring is stretched and how strong a pull has thus been exerted to deprive the body of motion. Notice also that while a small force applied sufficiently long will always restore the body to rest, yet that to produce rest quickly a large force will be required.[Pg 252]\n\n527. It is an universal law of nature that action and reaction are equal and opposite. Hence when any agent acts to set a body in motion, or to modify its motion in any way, the body reacts on the agent, and this force has been called the Kinetic reaction.\n\n528. For example. When a railway train starts, the locomotive applies force to the carriages, and the speed generated during one second is added to that produced during the next, and the pace improves. The kinetic reaction of the train retards the engine from attaining the speed it would acquire if free from the train.\n\nTHE HAMMER.\n529. The hammer and other tools which give a blow depend for their action upon inertia. A gigantic hammer might force in a nail by the mere weight of the head resting on the nail, but with the help of inertia we drive the nail by blows from a small hammer. We have here inertia aiding in the production of a mechanical power to overcome the considerable resistance which the wood opposes to the entrance of the nail. To drive in the nail usually requires a direct force of some hundreds of pounds, and this we are able conveniently to produce by suddenly checking the velocity of a small moving body.\n\n\nFig. 71.\n\n530. The theory of the hammer is illustrated by the apparatus in Fig. 71. It is a tripod, at the top of which, about 9' from the ground, is a stout pulley c; the rope is about 15' long, and to each end of it a and b are weights attached. These weights are at first each 14 lbs. I raise a up to the pulley, leaving b upon the ground; I then let go the rope, and down falls a: it first pulls the slack rope through, and then, when a is about 3' from the ground, the rope becomes tight, [Pg 253]b gets a violent chuck and is lifted into the air. What has raised B? It cannot be the mere weight of a, because that being equal to b, could only just balance b, and is insufficient to raise it. It must have been a force which raised b; that force must have been something more than the weight of a, which was produced when the motion was checked. a was not stopped completely; it only lost some of its velocity, but it could not lose any velocity without being acted upon by a force. This force must have been [Pg 254]applied by the rope by which a was held back, and the tension thus arising was sufficient to pull up b.\n\n531. Let us remove the 14 lb. weight from b, and attach there a weight of 28 lbs., a remaining the same as before (14 lbs.). I raise a to the pulley; I allow it to fall. You observe that b, though double the weight of a, is again chucked up after the rope has become tight. We can only explain this by the supposition that the tension in the rope exerted in checking the motion of a is at least 28 lbs.\n\n532. Finally, let us remove the 28 lbs. from b, put on 56 lbs., and perform the experiment again; you see that even the 56 lbs. is raised up several inches. Here a tension in the rope has been generated sufficient to overcome a weight four times as heavy as a. We have then, by the help of inertia, been able to produce a mechanical power, for a small force has overcome a greater.\n\n533. After b is raised by the chuck to a certain height it descends again, if heavier than a, and raises a. The height to which b is raised is of course the same as the height through which a descends. You noticed that the height through which 28 lbs. was raised was considerably greater than that through which the 56 lbs. was raised. Hence we may draw the inference, that when a was deprived of its velocity while passing through a short space, it required to be opposed by a greater force than when it was gradually deprived of its velocity through a longer space. This is a most important point. Supposing I were to put a hundredweight at b, I have little doubt, if the rope were strong enough to bear the strain, that though a only weighs 14 lbs., b would yet be raised a little: here a would be deprived of its motion in a very short space, but the force required to arrest it would be very great.[Pg 255]\n\n534. It is clear that matters would not be much altered if a were to be stopped by some force, exerted from below rather than above; in fact, we may conceive the rope omitted, and suppose a to be a hammer-head falling upon a nail in a piece of wood. The blow would force the nail to penetrate a small distance, and the entire velocity of a would have to be destroyed while moving through that small distance: consequently the force between the head of the nail and the hammer would be a very large one. This explains the effect of a blow.\n\n535. In the case that we have supposed, the weight merely drops upon the nail: this is actually the principle of the hammer used in pile-driving machines. A pile is a large piece of timber, pointed and shod with iron at one end: this end is driven down into the ground. Piles are required for various purposes in engineering operations. They are often intended to support the foundations of buildings; they are therefore driven until the resistance with which the ground opposes their further entrance affords a guarantee that they shall be able to bear what is required.\n\n  536. The machine for driving piles consists essentially of a heavy mass of iron, which is raised to a height, and allowed to fall upon the pile. The resistance to be overcome depends upon the depth and nature of the soil: a pile may be driven two or three inches with each blow, but the less the distance the pile enters each time, the greater is the actual pressure with which the blow forces it downwards. In the ordinary hammer, the power of the arm imparts velocity to the hammer-head, in addition to that which is due to the fall; the effect produced is merely the same as if the hammer had fallen from a greater height.\n\n537. Another point may be mentioned here. A nail will only enter a piece of wood when the nail and the wood are pressed together with [Pg 256]sufficient force. The nail is urged by the hammer. If the wood be lying on the ground, the reaction of the ground prevents the wood from getting away and the nail will enter. In other cases the element of time is all-important. If the wood be massive less force will make the nail penetrate than would suffice to move the wood quickly enough. If the wood be thin and unsupported, less force may be required to make it yield than to make the nail penetrate. The usual remedy is obvious. Hold a heavy mass close at the back of the wood. The nail will then enter because the augmented mass cannot now escape as rapidly as before.\n\nTHE STORING OF ENERGY.\n538. Our study of the subject will be facilitated by some considerations founded on the principles of energy. In the experiment of Fig. 71 let a be 14 lbs., and b, on the ground, be 56 lbs. Since the rope is 15' long, a is 3' from the ground, and therefore 6' from the pulley. I raise a to the pulley, and, in doing so, expend 6 \u00d7 14 = 84 units of energy. Energy is never lost, and therefore I shall expect to recover this amount. I allow a to fall; when it has fallen 6', it is then precisely in the same condition as it was before being raised, except that it has a considerable velocity of descent. In fact, the 84 units of energy have been expended in giving velocity to a. b is then lifted to a maximum height x, in which 56 \u00d7 x units of energy have been consumed. At the instant when b is at the summit x, a must be at a distance of 6 + x feet from the pulley; hence the quantity of work performed by a is 14 \u00d7 (6 + x). But the work done by a must be equal to that done upon b, and therefore\n\n14(6 + x) = 56 x,\n\nwhence x = 2. If there were no loss by friction, b would therefore be raised 2'; but owing to friction, and doubtless [Pg 257]also to the imperfect flexibility of the rope, the effect is not so great. We may regard the work done in raising a as so much energy stored up, and when a is allowed to fall, the energy is reproduced in a modified form.\n\n539. Let us apply the principle of energy to the pile-driving engine to which we have referred (Art. 536); we shall then be able to find the magnitude of the force developed in producing the blow. Suppose the \u201cmonkey,\u201d that is the heavy hammer-head, weighs 560 lbs. (a quarter of a ton). A couple of men raise this by means of a small winch to a height of 15'. It takes them a few minutes to do so; their energy is then saved up, and they have accumulated a store of 560 \u00d7 15 = 8,400 units. When the monkey falls upon the top of the pile it transfers thereto nearly the whole of the 8,400 units of energy, and this is expended in forcing the pile into the ground. Suppose the pile to enter one inch, the reaction of the pile upon the monkey must be so great that the number of units of energy consumed in one inch is 8,400. Hence this reaction must be 8,400 \u00d7 12 = 100,800 lbs. If the reaction did not reach this amount, the monkey could not be brought to rest in so short a distance. The reaction of the pile upon the monkey, and therefore the action of the monkey upon the pile, is about 45 tons. This is the actual pressure exerted.\n\n540. If the soil which the pile is penetrating be more resisting than that which we have supposed,\u2014for example, if the pile require a direct pressure of 100 tons to force it in,\u2014the same monkey with the same fall would still be sufficient, but the pile would not be driven so far with each blow. The pressure required is 224,000 lbs.: this exerted over a space of 0\"\u00b745 would be 8,400 units of energy; hence the pile would be driven 0\"\u00b745. The more the resistance, the less the [Pg 258]penetration produced by each blow. A pile intended to bear a very heavy load permanently must be driven until it enters but little with each blow.\n\n541. We may compare the pile-driver with the mechanical powers in one respect, and contrast it in another. In each, we have machines which receive energy and restore it modified into a greater power exerted through a smaller distance; but while the mechanical powers restore the energy at one end of the machine, simultaneously with their reception of it at the other, the pile-driver is a reservoir for keeping energy which will restore it in the form wanted.\n\n542. We have, then, a class of mechanical powers, of which a hammer may be taken as the type, which depend upon the storage of energy; the power of the arm is accumulated in the hammer throughout its descent, to be instantly transferred to the nail in the blow. Inertia is the property of matter which qualifies it for this purpose. Energy is developed by the explosion of gunpowder in a cannon. This energy is transferred to the ball, from which it is again in large part passed on to do work against the object which is struck. Here we see energy stored in a rapidly moving body, a case to which we shall presently return.\n\n543. But energy can be stored in many ways; we might almost say that gunpowder is itself energy in a compact and storable form. The efforts which we make in forcing air into an air-cane are preserved as energy there stored to be reproduced in the discharge of a number of bullets. During the few seconds occupied in winding a watch, a small charge of energy is given to the spring which it expends economically over the next twenty-four hours. In using a bow my energy is stored up from the moment I begin to pull the string until I release the arrow.[Pg 259]\n\n544. Many machines in extensive use depend upon these principles. In the clock or watch the demand for energy to sustain the motion is constant, while the supply is only occasional; in other cases the supply is constant, while the demand is only intermittent. We may mention an illustration of the latter. Suppose it be required occasionally to hoist heavy weights rapidly up to a height. If an engine sufficiently powerful to raise the weights be employed, the engine will be idle except when the weights are being raised; and if the machinery were to have much idle time, the waste of fuel in keeping up the fire during the intervals would often make the arrangement uneconomical. It would be a far better plan to have a smaller engine; and even though this were not able to raise the weight directly with sufficient speed, yet by keeping the engine continually working and storing up its energy, we might produce enough in the twenty-four hours to raise all the weights which it would be necessary to lift in the same time.\n\n  545. Let us suppose we want to raise slates from the bottom of a quarry to the surface. A large pulley is mounted at the top of the quarry, and over this a rope is passed: to each end of the rope a bucket is attached, so that when one of these is at the bottom the other is at the top, and their sizes and that of the pulley are so arranged that they pass each other with safety. A reservoir is established at the top of the quarry on a level with the pulley, and an engine is set to work constantly pumping up water from the bottom of the quarry into the reservoir. Each of the buckets is partly composed of a large tank, which can be quickly filled or emptied. The lower bucket is loaded with slates, and when ready for work, the man at the top fills the tank of the upper bucket with water: this accordingly becomes so heavy that it descends and raises the slates. When the heavier one reaches the [Pg 260]bottom, the water from its tank is let out into the lower reservoir, from which the engine pumps, and the slates are removed from the bucket which has been raised. All is then ready for a repetition of the same operation. If the slates be raised at intervals of ten minutes, the energy of the engine will be sufficient when in ten minutes\u2019 work it can pump up enough water to fill one tank; by the aid of this contrivance we are therefore able to accumulate for one effort the whole power of the engine for ten minutes.\n\nTHE FLY-WHEEL.\n546. One of the best means of storing energy is by setting a heavy body in rapid motion. This has already been referred to in the case of the cannon-ball. In order to render this method practically available for the purposes of machinery, the heavy body we use is a fly-wheel, and the rapid motion imparted to it is that of rotation about its axis. A very large amount of energy can by this means be stored in a manageable form.\n\n547. We shall illustrate the principle by the apparatus of Fig. 72. This represents an iron fly-wheel b: its diameter is 18\", and its weight is 26 lbs.; the fly is carried upon a shaft (a) of wrought iron \u00be\" in diameter. We shall store up a quantity of energy in this wheel, by setting it in rapid motion, and then we shall see how we can recover from it the energy we have imparted.\n\n548. A rope is coiled around the shaft; by pulling this rope the wheel is made to turn round: thus the rope is the medium by which my energy shall be imparted to the wheel. To measure the operation accurately, I attach the rope to the hook of the spring balance (Fig. 9); and by taking the ring of the balance in my hand, I learn from the index the [Pg 261]amount of the force I am exerting. I find that when I walk backwards as quickly as is convenient, pulling the rope all the time, the scale shows a tension of about 50 lbs. To set the wheel rapidly in motion, I pull about 20' of rope from the axle, so that I have imparted to the wheel somewhere about 50 \u00d7 20 = 1,000 units of energy. The rope is fastened to the shaft, so that, after it has been all unwound, the wheel now rapidly rotating winds it in. By measuring the time in which the wheel made a certain number of coils of the rope around the shaft, I find that it makes about 600 revolutions per minute.\n\n\nFig. 72.\n\n549. Let us see how the stored-up energy can be exhibited. A piece of pine 24\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\" of which both ends are supported, requires a force of 300 lbs. applied to its centre to produce fracture (See p. 190). I arrange such a piece of pine near the wheel. As the shaft is winding in the rope, a tremendous chuck would be given to anything which tried to [Pg 262]stop the motion. If I tied the end of the rope to the piece of pine, the chuck would break the rope; therefore I have fastened one end of a 10' length of chain to the rope, and the other has been tied round the middle of the wooden bar. The wheel first winds in the rope, then the chain takes a few turns before it tightens, and crack goes the rod of pine. The wheel had no choice; it must either stop or break the rod: but nature forbids it to be stopped, unless by a great force, which the rod was not strong enough to apply. Here I never exerted a force greater than 50 lbs. in setting the wheel in motion. The wheel stored up and modified my energy so as to produce a force of 300 lbs., which had, however, only to be exerted over a very small distance.\n\n550. But we may show the experiment in another way, which is that represented in the figure (72). We see the chain is there attached to two 56 lb. weights. The mode of proceeding is that already described. The rope is first wound round the shaft, then by pulling the rope the wheel is made to revolve; the wheel then begins to wind in the rope again, and when the chain tightens the two 56 lbs. are raised up to a height of 3 or 4 feet. Here, again, the energy has been stored and recovered. But though the fly-wheel will thus preserve energy, it does so at some cost: the store is continually being frittered away by friction and the resistance of the air; in fact, the energy would altogether disappear in a little time, and the wheel would come to rest; it is therefore economical to make the wheel yield up what it has received as soon as possible.\n\n551. These principles are illustrated by the function of the fly-wheel in a steam-engine. The pressure of the steam upon the piston varies according to the different parts of the stroke: and the fly-wheel obviates the inconvenience which would arise from such irregularity. [Pg 263]Its great inertia makes its velocity but little augmented by the exuberant action of the piston when the pressure is greatest, while it also sustains the motion when the piston is giving no assistance. The fly-wheel is a vast reservoir into which the engine pours its energy, sudden floods alternating with droughts; but these succeed each other so rapidly, and the area of the reservoir is so vast, that its level remains sensibly uniform, and the supplies sent out to the consumers are regular and unvaried. The consumers of the energy stored in the fly-wheel of an engine are the machines in the mill; they are supplied by shafts which traverse the building, conveying, by their rotation, the energy originally condensed within the coal from which combustion has set it free.\n\nTHE PUNCHING MACHINE.\n552. When energy has been stored in a fly-wheel, it can be withdrawn either as a small force acting over a great distance, or as a large force over a small distance. In the latter case the fly-wheel acts as a mechanical power, and in this form it is used in the very important machine to be next described. A model of the punching machine is shown in Fig. 73.\n\nThe punching machine is usually worked by a steam-engine, a handle will move our small model. The handle turns a shaft on which the fly-wheel f is mounted. On the shaft is a small pinion d of 40 teeth: this works into a large wheel e of 200 teeth, so that, when the fly and the pinion have turned round 5 times, e will have turned round once, c is a circular piece of wood called a cam, which has a hole bored through it, between the centre and circumference; by means of this hole, the cam is mounted on the same axle as e, to which it is rigidly fastened, so that the two must revolve together. a is a lever of the first order, whose[Pg 264] fulcrum is at a: the remote end of this lever rests upon the cam c; the other end b contains the punch. As the wheel e revolves it carries with it the cam: this raises the lever and forces the punch down a hole in a die, into which it fits exactly. The metal to be operated on is placed under the punch before it is depressed by the cam, and the pressure drives the punch through, cutting out a cylindrical piece of metal from the plate: this model will, as you see, punch through ordinary tin.\n\n\nFig. 73.\n\n553. Let us examine the mode of action. The machine being made to rotate rapidly, the punch is depressed once for every 5 revolutions of the fly; the resistance which the metal opposes to being punched is no doubt very great, but the lever acts at a twelve-fold advantage. When the punch comes down on the surface of the metal, one of three things must happen: either the motion must stop suddenly, or the machine must be strained and injured, or the metal must be punched. But the motion cannot be stopped suddenly, because, before this could happen, an [Pg 265]infinite force would be developed, which must make something yield. If therefore we make the structure sufficiently massive to prevent yielding, the metal must be punched. Such machines are necessarily built strong enough to make the punching of the metal easier than breaking the machine.\n\n554. We shall be able to calculate, from what we have already seen in Art. 248, the magnitude of the force required for punching. We there learned that about 22\u00b75 tons of pressure was necessary to shear a bar of iron one square inch in section. Punching is so far analogous to shearing that in each case a certain area of surface has to be cut; the area in punching is measured by the cylinder of iron which is removed.\n\n555. Suppose it be required to punch a hole 0\"\u00b75 in diameter through a plate 0\"\u00b78 thick, the area of iron that has to be cut across is \u00b2\u00b2/\u2087 \u00d7 \u00bd \u00d7 \u2074/\u2085 = 1\u00b726 square inches: and as 22\u00b75 tons per square inch are required for shearing, this hole will require 22\u00b75 \u00d7 1\u00b726 = 28\u00b74 tons. A force of this amount must therefore be exerted upon the punch: which will require from the cam a force of more than 2 tons upon its end of the lever. Though the iron must be pierced to a depth of 0\"\u00b78, yet it is obvious that almost immediately after the punch has penetrated the surface of the iron, the cylinder must be entirely cut and begin to emerge from the other side of the plate. We shall certainly be correct in supposing that the punching is completed before the punch has penetrated to a depth of 0\"\u00b72, and that for not more than this distance has the great pressure of 28 tons been exerted; for a small pressure is afterwards sufficient to overcome the friction which opposes the motion of the cylinder of iron. Hence, though so great a pressure has been required, yet the number of units of energy consumed is not very large; it is \u00b9/\u2086\u2080 \u00d7 2240 \u00d7 28\u00b74 = 1062.[Pg 266]\n\nThe energy actually required to punch a hole of half an inch diameter through a plate eight-tenths of an inch thick is therefore less than that which would be expended in raising 1 cwt. to a height of ten feet.\n\n556. The fly-wheel may be likened to the reservoir in Art. 545. The time that is actually occupied in the punching is extremely small, and the sudden expenditure of 1062 units is gradually reimbursed by the engine. If the rotating fly-wheel contain 50,000 units of energy, the abstraction of 1362 units will not perceptibly affect its velocity. There is therefore an advantage in having a heavy fly sustained at a high speed for the working of a punching machine.[Pg 267]\n\nLECTURE XVII.\nCIRCULAR MOTION.\nThe Nature of Circular Motion.\u2014Circular motion in Liquids.\u2014The Applications of Circular Motion.\u2014The Permanent Axes.\n\nTHE NATURE OF CIRCULAR MOTION.\n557. To compel a body to swerve from motion in a straight line force must be exercised. In this chapter we shall study the comparatively simple case of a body revolving in a circle.\n\n558. When a body moves round uniformly in a circle force must be continuously applied, and the first question for us to examine is, as to the direction of that force. We have to demonstrate the important fact, that it constantly tends towards the centre.\n\n559. The direction of the force can be exhibited by actual experiment, and its magnitude will be at the same time clearly indicated by the extent to which a spring is stretched. The apparatus we use is shown in Fig. 74.[Pg 268]\n\nThe essential parts of the machine consist of two balls a, b, each 2\" in diameter: these are thin hollow spheres of silvered brass. The balls are supported on arms p a, q b, which are attached to a piece of wood, p q, capable of turning on a socket at c. The arm a p is rigidly fixed to p q; the other arm, b q, is capable of turning round a pin at q. An india-rubber door-spring is shown at f; one end of this is secured to p q, the other end to the movable arm, q b. If the arm q b be turned so as to move b away from c, the spring f must be stretched.\n\n\nFig. 74.\n\nA small toothed wheel is mounted on the same socket as c; this [Pg 269]is behind p q, and is therefore not seen in the figure: the whole is made to revolve rapidly by the large wheel e, which is turned by the handle d.\n\n560. The room being darkened, a beam from the lime-light is allowed to fall on the apparatus: the reflections of the light are seen in the two silvered balls as two bright points. When d is turned, the balls move round rapidly, and you see the points of light reflected from them describe circles. The ball b when at rest is 4\" from c, while a is 8\" from c; hence the circle described by b is smaller than that described by a. The appearance presented is that of two concentric luminous circles. As the speed increases, the inner circle enlarges till the two circles blend into one. By increasing the speed still more, you see the circle whose diameter is enlarging actually exceeding the fixed circle, and its size continues to increase until the highest velocity which it is safe to employ has been communicated to the machine.\n\n561. What is the explanation of this? The arm a is fixed and the distance a c cannot alter, hence a describes the fixed circle. b, on the other hand, is not fixed; it can recede from c, and we find that the quicker the speed the further it recedes. The larger the circle described by b the more is the spring stretched, and the greater is the force with which b is attracted towards the centre. This experiment proves that the force necessary to retain a body in a circular path must be increased when the speed is increased.\n\n562. Thus we see that uniform motion of a body in a circle can only be produced by an uniform force directed to the centre.\n\nIf the motion, even though circular, have variable speed the law of the force is not so simple.\n\n563. We can measure the magnitude of this force by the same apparatus. [Pg 270]The ball b weighs 0\u00b71 lb. I find that I must pull it with a force of 3 lbs. in order to draw it to a distance of 8\" from c; that is, to the same distance as a is from c. Hence, when the diameters of the circles in which the balls move are equal, the central force must be 3 lbs.; that is, it must be nearly thirty times as great as gravity.\n\n564. The necessity for the central force is thus shown: Let us conceive a weight attached to a string to be swung round in a circle, a portion of which is shown in Fig. 75.\n\n\nFig. 75.\n\nSuppose the weight be at s and moving towards p, and let a tangent to the circle be drawn at p. Take two points on[Pg 271] the circle, a and B, very near p; the small arc a b does not differ perceptibly from the part a b on the tangent line; hence, when the particle arrives at a, it is a matter of indifference whether it travels in the arc a b, or along the line a b. Let us suppose it to move along the line. By the first law of motion, a particle moving in the line a b would continue to do so; hence, if the particle be allowed, it will move on to q: but the particle is not allowed to move to q; it is found at r. Hence it must have been withdrawn by some force.\n\n565. This force is supplied by the string to which the weight is attached. The incessant change from the rectilinear motion of the weight requires a constantly applied force, and this is always directed to the centre. Should the string be released, the body flies off in the direction of the tangent to the circle at the point which the body occupied at the instant of release.\n\n566. The central force increases in proportion to the square of the velocity. If I double the speed with which the weight is whirled round in the circle, I quadruple the force which the string must exert on the body. If the speed be trebled, the force is increased ninefold, and so on. When the speeds with which two equal masses are revolving in two circles are equal, the central force in the smaller circle is greater than that of the larger circle, in the proportion of the radius of the larger circle to that of the smaller.\n\nTHE ACTION OF CIRCULAR MOTION\nUPON LIQUIDS.\n567. I have here a small bucket nearly filled with water: to the handle [Pg 272]a piece of string is attached. If I whirl the bucket round in a vertical plane sufficiently fast, you see no water escapes, although the bucket is turned upside down once in every revolution. This is because the water has not time to fall out during such a brief interval. A body would not fall half an inch from rest in the twentieth of a second.\n\n568. The action of circular motion upon liquids is illustrated by the experiment which is represented in Fig. 76.\n\n\nFig. 76.\n\nA glass beaker about half full of water is mounted so that it can be spun round rapidly. The motion is given by means of a large wheel turned by a handle, as shown in the figure. When the rotation commences, the water is seen to rise up against the glass sides and form a hollow in the centre.\n\n569. In order to demonstrate this clearly, I turn upon the vessel a [Pg 273]beam from the lime-light. I have previously dissolved a little quinine in the water. The light from the lamp is transmitted through a piece of dense blue glass. When the light thus coloured falls on the water, the presence of the quinine makes the entire liquid glow with a bluish hue. This remarkable property of quinine, which is known as fluorescence, enables you to see distinctly the hollow form caused by the rotation.\n\n570. You observe that as the speed becomes greater the depth of the hollow increases, and that if I turn the wheel sufficiently fast the water is actually driven out of the glass. The shape of the curve which the water assumes is that which would be produced by the revolution of a parabola about its axis.\n\n571. The explanation is simple. As soon as the glass begins to revolve, the friction of its sides speedily imparts a revolving motion to the water; but in this case there is nothing to keep the particles near the centre like the string in the revolving weight, so the liquid rises at the sides of the glass.\n\n572. But you may ask why all the particles of the water should not go to the circumference, and thus line the inside of the glass with a hollow cylinder of water instead of the parabola. Such an arrangement could not exist in a liquid acted on by gravity. The lower parts of the cylinder must bear the pressure of the water above, and therefore have more tendency to flatten out than the upper portions. This tendency could not be overcome by any consequences of the movement, for such must be alike on all parts at the same distance from the axis.\n\n573. A very beautiful experiment was devised by Plateau for the purpose of studying the revolution of a liquid removed from the action of gravity.[Pg 274]\n\nThe apparatus employed is represented in Fig. 77. A glass vessel 9\" cube is filled with a mixture of alcohol and water. The relative quantities ought to be so proportioned that the fluid has the same specific gravity as olive oil, which is heavier than alcohol and lighter than water. In practice, however, it is found so difficult to adjust the composition exactly that the best plan is to make two alcoholic mixtures so that olive oil will just float on one of them, and just sink in the other. The lower half of the glass is to be filled with the denser mixture, and the upper half with the lighter. If, then, the oil be carefully introduced with a funnel it will form a beautiful sphere in the middle of the vessel, as shown in the figure. We thus see that a liquid mass freed from the action of terrestrial gravity, forms a sphere by the mutual attraction of its particles.\n\n\nFig. 77.\n\n[Pg 275]Through the liquid a vertical spindle passes. On this there is a small disk at the middle of its length, about which the sphere of oil arranges itself symmetrically. To the end of the spindle a handle is attached. When the handle is turned round slowly, the friction of the disk and spindle communicates a motion of rotation to the sphere of oil. We have thus a liquid spheroidal mass endowed with a movement of rotation; and we can study the effect of the motion upon its form. We first see the sphere flatten down at its poles, and bulge at its equator. In order to show the phenomenon to those who may not be near to the table, the sphere can be projected on the screen by the help of the lime-light lamp and a lens. It first appears as a yellow circle, and then, as the rotation begins, the circle gradually transforms into an ellipse. But a very remarkable modification takes place when the handle is turned somewhat rapidly. The ellipsoid gradually flattens down until, when a certain velocity has been attained, the surface actually becomes indented at the poles, and flies from the axis altogether. Ultimately the liquid assumes the form of a beautiful ring, and the appearance on the screen is shown in Fig. 78.\n\n\nFig. 78.\n\n574. The explanation of the development of the ring involves some additional principles: as the sphere of oil spins round in the liquid, its surface is retarded by friction; so that when the velocity attains a certain amount, the internal portions of the sphere, which are in the neighbourhood of the spindle, are driven from the centre into the outer portions, but the full account of the phenomenon cannot be given here.[Pg 276]\n\n575. The earth was, we believe, originally in a fluid condition. It had then, as it has now, a diurnal rotation, and one of the consequences of this rotation has been to cause the form to be slightly protuberant at the equator, just as we have seen the sphere of oil to bulge out under similar conditions.\n\n576. Bodies lying on the earth are whirled around in a great circle every day. Hence, if there were not some force drawing them to the centre, they would fly off at a tangent. A part of the earth\u2019s attraction goes for this purpose, and the remainder, which is the apparent weight, is thus diminished by a quantity increasing from the pole to the equator (Art. 86).\n\nTHE APPLICATIONS OF CIRCULAR MOTION.\n577. These principles have many applications in the mechanical arts; we shall mention two of them. The first is to the governor-balls of a steam-engine; the second is to the process of sugar refining.\n\nAn engine which turns a number of machines in a factory should work uniformly. Irregularities of motion may be productive of loss and various inconveniences. An engine would work irregularly either from variation in the production of steam, or from the demands upon the power being lessened or increased. Even if the first of these sources of irregularity could be avoided by care, it is clear that the second could not. Some machines in the mill are occasionally stopped, others occasionally set in motion, and the engine generally tends to go faster the less it has to do. It is therefore necessary to provide means by which the speed shall be restrained within narrow limits, and it is obviously desirable that the contrivance used for this purpose should be self-acting. We must, therefore, have some arrangement which shall [Pg 277]admit more steam to the cylinder when the engine is moving too slowly, and less steam when it is moving too quickly. The valve which is to regulate this must be worked by some agent which depends upon the velocity of the engine; this at once points to circular motion because the force acting on the revolving body depends upon its velocity. Such was the train of reasoning which led to the happy invention of the governor-balls: these are shown in Fig. 79.\n\n\nFig. 79.\n\na b is a vertical spindle which is turned by the engine. p p is a piece firmly attached to the spindle and turning with it. p w, p w are arms terminating in weights w w; these are balls of iron, generally very massive: the arms are free to turn round pins at p p. At q q links are placed, attached to another piece r r, which is free to slide up and down the spindle. When a b rotates, w and w are carried round, and therefore fly outwards from the spindle; to do this they must evidently pull the piece r r up the shaft. We can easily imagine an arrangement by which r r shall be made to shut or open the steam-valve according as it ascends or descends. The problem is then solved, for if the engine begin to go too rapidly, the balls fly out further just as they did in Fig. 74: this movement raises the piece r r, [Pg 278]which diminishes the supply of steam, and consequently checks the speed. On the other hand, when the engine works too slowly, the balls fall in towards the spindle, the piece r r descends, the valve is opened, and a greater supply of steam is admitted. The objection to this governor is that though it moderates, it does not completely check irregularity. There are other governors occasionally employed which depend also on circular motion; some of these are more sensitive than the governor-balls; but they are elaborate machines, only to be employed under exceptional circumstances.\n\n578. The application of circular motion to sugar refining is a very beautiful invention. To explain it I must briefly describe the process of refining.\n\nThe raw sugar is dissolved in water, and the solution is purified by straining and by filtration through animal charcoal. The syrup is then boiled. In order to preserve the colour of the sugar, and to prevent loss, this boiling is conducted in vacuo, as by this means the temperature required is much less than would be necessary with the ordinary atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe evaporation having been completed, crystals of sugar form throughout the mass of syrup. To separate these crystals from the liquor which surrounds them, the aid of circular motion force is called in. A mass of the mixture is placed in a large iron tub, the sides of which are perforated with small holes. The tub is then made to rotate with prodigious velocity; its contents instantly fly off to the circumference, the liquid portions find an exit through the perforations in the sides, but the crystals are left behind. A little clear syrup is then sprinkled over the sugar while still rotating: this washes from the crystals the last traces of the coloured liquid, and passes out through the holes; when the motion ceases, the inside of the [Pg 279]tub contains a layer of perfectly pure white sugar, some inches in thickness, ready for the market.\n\n579. Circular motion is peculiarly fitted for this purpose; each particle of liquid strives to get as far away from the axis as possible. The action on the sugar is very different from what it would have been had the mass been subjected to pressure by a screw-press or similar contrivance; the particles immediately acted on would then have to transmit the pressure to those within; and the consequence would be that while the crystals of sugar on the outside would be crushed and destroyed, the water would only be very imperfectly driven from the interior: for it could lurk in the interstices of the sugar, which remain notwithstanding the pressure.\n\n580. But with circular motion the water must go, not because it is pushed by the crystals, but because of its own inertia; and it can be perfectly expelled by a velocity of rotation less than that which would be necessary to produce sufficient pressure to make the crystals injure each other.\n\nTHE PERMANENT AXES.\n581. There are some curious properties of circular motion which remain to be considered. These we shall investigate by means of the apparatus of Fig. 80. This consists of a pair of wheels b c, by which a considerable velocity can be given to a horizontal shaft. This shaft is connected by a pair of bevelled wheels d with a vertical spindle f. The machine is worked by a handle a, and the object to be experimented upon is suspended from the spindle.\n\n582. I first take a disk of wood 18\" in diameter; a hole is bored in [Pg 280]the margin of this disk; through this hole a rope is fastened, by means of which the disk is suspended from the spindle. The disk hangs of course in a vertical plane.\n\n\nFig. 80.\n\n583. I now begin to turn the handle round gently, and you see the disk begins to rotate about the vertical diameter; but, as the speed increases, the motion becomes a little unsteady; and finally, when I turn the handle very rapidly, the disk springs up into a horizontal [Pg 281]plane, and you see it like the surface of a small table: the rope swings round and round in a cone, so rapidly that it is hardly seen.\n\n584. We may repeat the experiment in a different manner. I take a piece of iron chain about 2' long, g; I pass the rope through the two last links of its extremities, and suspend the rope from the spindle. When I commence to turn the handle, you see the chain gradually opens out into a loop h; and as the speed increases, the loop becomes a complete ring. Still increasing the speed, I find the ring becomes unsteady, till finally it rises into a horizontal plane. The ring of chain in the horizontal plane is shown at i. When the motion is further increased, the ring swings about violently, and so I cease turning the handle.\n\n\nFig. 81.\n\n[Pg 282]585. The principles already enunciated will explain these remarkable results; we shall only describe that of the chain, as the same explanation will include that of the disk of wood. We shall begin with the chain hanging vertically from the spindle: the moment rotation commences, the chain begins to spin about a vertical axis; the parts of the chain fly outwards from this axis just as the ball flies outwards in Fig. 74; this is the cause of the looped form h which the chain assumes. As the speed is increased the loop gradually opens more and more, just as the diameter of the circle Fig. 74 increases with the velocity. But we have also to inquire into the cause of the remarkable change of position which the ring undergoes; instead of continuing to rotate about a vertical diameter, it comes into a horizontal plane. This will be easily understood with the help of Fig. 81. Let o p represent the rope attached to the ring, and o c be the vertical axis. Suppose the ring to be spinning about the axis o c, when o c was a diameter; if then, from any cause, the ring be slightly displaced, we can show that the circular motion will tend to drive the ring further from the vertical plane, and force it into the horizontal plane. Let the ring be in the position represented in the figure; then, since it revolves about the vertical line o c, the tendency of p p and q q is to move outwards in the directions of the arrows, thus evidently tending to bring the ring into the horizontal plane.\n\n586. In Art. 103 we have explained what is meant by stable and unstable equilibrium; we have here found a precisely analogous phenomenon in motion. The rotation of the ring about its diameter is unstable, for the minutest deviation of the ring from this position is fatal; circumstances immediately combine to augment the deviation more and more, until finally the ring is raised into the horizontal plane. Once [Pg 283]in the horizontal plane, the motion there is stable, for if the ring be displaced the tendency is to restore it to the horizontal.\n\n587. The ring, when in a horizontal plane, rotates permanently about the vertical axis through its centre; this axis is called permanent, to distinguish it from all other directions, as being the only axis about which the motion is stable.\n\n588. We may show another experiment with the chain: if instead of passing the rope through the links at its ends, I pass the rope through the centre of the chain, and allow the ends of the chain to hang downwards. I now turn the handle; instantly the parts of the chain fly outwards in a curved form; and by increasing the velocity, the parts of the chain at length come to lie almost in a straight line.[Pg 284]\n\nLECTURE XVIII.\nTHE SIMPLE PENDULUM.\nIntroduction.\u2014The Circular Pendulum.\u2014Law connecting the Time of Vibration with the Length.\u2014The Force of Gravity determined by the Pendulum.\u2014The Cycloid.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n589. If a weight be attached to a piece of string, the other end of which hangs from a fixed point, we have what is called a simple pendulum. The pendulum is of the utmost importance in science, as well as for its practical applications as a time-keeper. In this lecture and the next we shall treat of its general properties; and the last will be devoted to the practical applications. We shall commence with the simple pendulum, as already defined, and prove, by experiment, the remarkable property which was discovered by Galileo. The simple pendulum is often called the circular pendulum.[Pg 285]\n\nTHE CIRCULAR PENDULUM.\n\nFig. 82.\n\n590. We first experiment with a pendulum on a large scale. Our lecture theatre is 32 feet high, and there is a wire suspended from the ceiling 27' long; to the end of this a ball of cast iron weighing 25 lbs. is attached. This wire when at rest hangs vertically in the direction o c (Fig. 82).\n\nI draw the ball from its position of rest to a; when released, it slowly returns to c, its original position; it then moves on the other side to b, and back again to my hand at a. The ball\u2014or to speak more precisely, the centre of the ball\u2014moves in a circle, the centre being the point o in the ceiling from which the wire is suspended.\n\n591. What causes the motion of the pendulum when the weight is released? It is the force of gravity; for by moving the ball to a I raise it a little, and therefore, when I release it gravity compels it to return to c it being the only manner in which the mode of suspension will allow it to fall. But when it has reached its original position at c, why does it continue its motion?\u2014for gravity must be acting against the ball during the journey from c to b. The first law of motion explains this. (Art. 485). In travelling from a to c the ball has acquired a certain velocity, hence it has a tendency to go on, and only by the time it has arrived at b will gravity have arrested the velocity, and begin to make it descend.\n\n592. You see, the ball continues moving to and fro\u2014oscillating, as it [Pg 286]is called\u2014for a long time. The fact is that it would oscillate for ever, were it not for the resistance of the air, and for some loss of energy at the point of suspension.\n\n593. By the time of an oscillation is meant the time of going from a to b, but not back again. The time of our long pendulum is nearly three seconds.\n\n594. With reference to the time of oscillation Galileo made a great discovery. He found that whether the pendulum were swinging through the arc a b, or whether it had been brought to the point a\u00b4, and was thus describing the arc a\u00b4 b\u00b4, the time of oscillation remained nearly the same. The arc through which the pendulum oscillates is called its amplitude, so that we may enunciate this truth by saying that the time of oscillation is nearly independent of the amplitude. The means by which Galileo proved this would hardly be adopted in modern days. He allowed a pendulum to perform a certain number of vibrations, say 100, through the arc a b, and he counted his pulse during the time; he then counted the number of pulsations while the pendulum vibrated 100 times in the arc a\u00b4 b\u00b4, and he found the number of pulsations in the two cases to be equal. Assuming, what is probably true, that Galileo\u2019s pulse remained uniform throughout the experiment, this result showed that the pendulum took the same time to perform 100 vibrations, whether it swung through the arc a b, or through the arc a\u00b4 b\u00b4. This discovery it was which first suggested the employment of the pendulum as a means of keeping time.\n\n595. We shall adopt a different method to show that the time does not depend upon the amplitude. I have here an arrangement which is represented in Fig. 83. It consists of two pendulums a d and b c, each 12' long, and suspended from two points a [Pg 287]b, about 1' apart, in the same horizontal line. Each of these pendulums carries a weight of the same size: they are in fact identical.\n\n\nFig. 83.\n\n[Pg 288]596. I take one of the balls in each hand. If I withdraw each of them from its position of rest through equal distances and then release them, both balls return to my hands at the same instant. This might have been expected from the identity of the circumstances.\n\n597. I next withdraw the weight c in my right hand to a distance of 1', and the weight d in my left hand to a distance of 2', and release them simultaneously. What happens? I keep my hands steadily in the same position, and I find that the two weights return to them at the same instant. Hence, though one of the weights moved through an amplitude of 2' (c e) while the other moved through an amplitude of 4' (d f), the times occupied by each in making two oscillations are identical. If I draw the right-hand ball away 3', while I draw the left hand only 1' from their respective positions of rest, I still observe the same result.\n\n  598. In two oscillations we can see no effect on the time produced by the amplitude, and we are correct in saying that, when the amplitude is only a small fraction of the length of the pendulum, its effect is inappreciable. But if the amplitude of one pendulum were very large, we should find that its time of oscillation is slightly greater than that of the other, though to detect the difference would require a delicate test. One consequence of what is here remarked will be noticed at a later page. (Art. 655.)\n\n599. We next inquire whether the weight which is attached to the pendulum has any influence upon the time of vibration. Using the 12' pendulums of Fig. 83, I place a weight of 12 lbs. on one hook and one of 6 lbs. on the other. I withdraw one in each hand; I release them; they return to my hand at the same moment. Whether I withdraw the weights through long arcs or short arcs, equal or unequal, they [Pg 289]invariably return together, and both therefore have the same time of vibration. With other iron weights the same law is confirmed, and hence we learn that, besides being independent of the amplitude, the time of vibration is also independent of the weight.\n\n600. Finally, let us see if the material of the pendulum can influence its time of vibration. I place a ball of wood on one wire and a ball of iron on the other; I swing them as before: the vibrations are still performed in equal times. A ball of lead is found to swing in the same time as a ball of brass, and both in the same time as a ball of iron or of wood.\n\n601. In this we may be reminded of the experiments on gravity (Art. 491), where we showed that all bodies fall to the ground in equal times, whatever be their sizes or their materials. From both cases the inference is drawn that the force of gravity upon different bodies is proportional to their masses, though the bodies be made of various substances. It was indeed by means of experiments with the pendulum that Newton proved that gravity had this property, which is one of the most remarkable truths in nature.\n\nLAW CONNECTING THE TIME OF VIBRATION\nWITH THE LENGTH.\n602. We have seen that the time of vibration of a pendulum depends neither upon its amplitude, material, nor weight; we have now to learn on what the time does depend. It depends upon the length of the pendulum. The shorter a pendulum the less is its time of vibration. We shall find by experiment the relation between the time and the length of the cord by which the weight is suspended.[Pg 290]\n\n\nFig. 84.\n\n603. I have here (Fig. 84) two pendulums a d, b c, one of which is 12' long and the other 3'; they are mounted side by side, and the weights are at the same distance from the floor. I take one of the weights in each hand, and withdraw them to the same distance [Pg 291]from the position of rest. I release the balls simultaneously; c moves off rapidly, arrives at the end c\u00b4 while d has only reached d\u00b4, and returns to my hand just as d has completed one oscillation. I do not seize c: it goes off again, only to return at the same moment when d reaches my hand. Thus c has performed four oscillations while d has made no more than two. This proves that when one of two pendulums is a quarter the length of the other, the time of vibration of the shorter one is half that of the other.\n\n604. We shall repeat the experiment with another pendulum 27' long, suspended from the ceiling, and compare its vibrations with those of a pendulum 3' long. I draw the weights to one side and release them as before; and you see that the small pendulum returns twice to my hand while the long pendulum is still absent; but that, keeping my hands steadily in the same place throughout the experiment, the long pendulum at last returns simultaneously with the third arrival of the short one. Hence we learn that a pendulum 27' long takes three times as much time for a single vibration as a 3' pendulum.\n\n605. The lengths of the three pendulums on which we have experimented (27', 12', 3'), are in the proportions of the numbers 9, 4, 1; and the times of the oscillations are proportional to 3, 2, 1: hence we learn that the period of oscillation of a pendulum is proportional to the square root of its length.\n\n  606. But the time of vibration must also depend upon gravity; for it is only owing to gravity that the pendulum vibrates at all. It is evident that, if gravity were increased, all bodies would fall to the earth more than 16' in the first second. The effect on the pendulum would be to draw the ball more quickly from d to d\u00b4 (Fig. 84), and thus the time of vibration would be diminished.[Pg 292]\n\nIt is found by calculation, and the result is confirmed by experiment, that the time of vibration is represented by the expression,\n\n3\u00b71416 \u221a ( Length / Force of gravity).\n\n  607. The accurate value of the force of gravity in London is 32\u00b71908, so that the time of vibration of a pendulum there is 0\u00b75537\u221a length: the length of the seconds pendulum is 3'\u00b72616.\n\nTHE FORCE OF GRAVITY DETERMINED\nBY THE PENDULUM.\n  608. The pendulum affords the proper means of measuring the force of gravity at any place on the earth. We have seen that the time of vibration can be expressed in terms of the length and the force of gravity; so conversely, when the length and the time of vibration are known, the force of gravity can be determined and the expression for it is\u2014\n\nLength \u00d7 (3\u00b71416 / Time)\u00b2.\n\n609. It is impossible to observe the time of a single vibration with the necessary degree of accuracy; but supposing we consider a large number of vibrations, say 100, and find the time taken to perform them, we shall then learn the time of one oscillation by dividing the entire period by 100. The amplitudes of the oscillations may diminish, but they are still performed in the same time; and hence, if we are sure [Pg 293]that we have not made a mistake of more than one second in the whole time, there cannot be an error of more than 0\u00b701 second, in the time of one oscillation. By taking a still larger number the time may be determined with the utmost precision, so that this part of the inquiry presents little difficulty.\n\n  610. But the length of the pendulum has also to be ascertained, and this is a rather baffling problem. The ideal pendulum whose length is required, is supposed to be composed of a very fine, perfectly flexible cord, at the end of which a particle without appreciable size is attached; but this is very different from the pendulum which we must employ. We are not sure of the exact position of the point of suspension, and, even if we had a perfect sphere for the weight, the distance between its centre and the point of suspension is not the same thing as the length of the simple pendulum that would vibrate in the same time. Owing to these circumstances, the measurement of the pendulum is embarrassed by considerable difficulties, which have however been overcome by ingenious contrivances to be described in the next chapter.\n\n611. But we shall perform, in a very simple way, an experiment for determining the force of gravity. I have here a silken thread which is fastened by being clamped between two pieces of wood. A cast iron ball 2\"\u00b754 in diameter is suspended by this piece of silk. The distance from the point of suspension of the silk to the ball is 24\"\u00b707, as well as it can be measured.\n\nThe length of the ideal pendulum which would vibrate isochronously with this pendulum is 25\"\u00b737, being about 0\"\u00b703 greater than the distance from the point of suspension to the centre of the sphere.\n\n  612. The length having been ascertained, the next element to be [Pg 294]determined is the time of vibration. For this purpose I use a stop-watch, which can be started or stopped instantaneously by touching a little stud: this watch will indicate time accurately to one-fifth of a second. It is necessary that the pendulum should swing in a small arc, as otherwise the oscillations are not strictly isochronous. Quite sufficient amplitude is obtained by allowing the ball to rotate to and fro through a few tenths of an inch.\n\n613. In order to observe the movement easily, I have mounted a little telescope, through which I can view the top of the ball. In the eye-piece of the telescope a vertical wire is fastened, and I count each vibration just as the silken thread passes the vertical wire. Taking my seat with the stop-watch in my hand, I write down the position of the hands of the stop-watch, and then look through the telescope. I see the pendulum slowly moving to and fro, crossing the vertical wire at every vibration; on one occasion, just as it passes the wire, I touch the stud and start the watch. I allow the pendulum to make 300 vibrations, and as the silk arrives at the vertical wire for the 300th time, I promptly stop the watch; on reference I find that 241\u00b76 seconds have elapsed since the time the watch was started. To avoid error, I repeat this experiment, with precisely the same result: 241\u00b76 seconds are again required for the completion of 300 vibrations.\n\n614. It is desirable to reckon the vibrations from the instant when the pendulum is at the middle of its stroke, rather than when it arrives at the end of the swing. In the former case the pendulum is moving with the greatest rapidity, and therefore the time of coincidence between the thread and the vertical wire can be observed with especial definiteness.\n\n615. The time of a single vibration is found, by dividing 241\u00b76 by 300, [Pg 295]to be 0\u00b7805 second. This is certainly correct to within a thousandth part of a second. We conclude that a pendulum whose length is 25\"\u00b737 = 2\u00b7114, vibrates in 0\u00b7805 second; and from this we find that gravity at Dublin is 2'\u00b7114 \u00d7 (3\u00b71416 / 0.805)\u00b2 = 32\u00b7196. This result agrees with one which has been determined by measurement made with every precaution.\n\nAnother method of measuring gravity by the pendulum will be described in the next lecture (Art. 637).\n\nTHE CYCLOID.\n616. If the amplitude of the vibration of a circular pendulum bear a large proportion to the radius, the time of oscillation is slightly greater than if the amplitude be very small. The isochronism of the pendulum is only true for small arcs.\n\n617. But there is a curve in which a weight may be made to move where the time of vibration is precisely the same, whatever be the amplitude. This curve is called a cycloid. It is the path described by a nail in the circumference of a wheel, as the wheel rolls along the ground. Thus, if a circle be rolled underneath the line a b (Fig. 85), a point on its circumference describes the cycloid a d c p b. The lower part of this curve does not differ very much from a circle whose centre is a certain point o above the curve.\n\n618. Suppose we had a piece of wire carefully shaped to the cycloidal curve a d c p b, and that a ring could slide along it without friction, it would be found that, whether the ring be allowed to drop from c, p or b, it would fall to d precisely in the same time, and would then run up [Pg 296]the wire to a distance from d on the other side equal to that from which it had originally started. In the oscillations on the cycloid, the amplitude is absolutely without effect upon the time.\n\n619. As a frictionless wire is impossible, we cannot adopt this method, but we can nevertheless construct a cycloidal pendulum in another way, by utilizing a property of the curve, o a (Fig. 85) as a half cycloid; in fact, o a is just the same curve as b d, but placed in a different position, so also is o b. If a string of length o d be suspended from the point o, and have a weight attached to it, the weight will describe the cycloid, provided that the string wrap itself along the arcs o a and o b; thus when the weight has moved from d to p, the string is wrapped along the curve through the space o t, the part t p only being free. This arrangement will always force the point p to move in the cycloidal arc.\n\n\nFig. 85.\n\n620. We are now in a condition to ascertain experimentally, whether the time of oscillation in the cycloid is independent of the amplitude. We use for this purpose the apparatus shown in Fig. 86. d c e is the arc of the cycloid; two strings are attached at o, and equal weights a, b are suspended from them; [Pg 297]c is the lowest point of the curve. The time a will take to fall through the arc a c is of course half the time of its oscillation. If, therefore, I can show that a and b both take the same time to fall down to c, I shall have proved that the vibrations are isochronous.\n\n\nFig. 86.\n\n621. Holding, as shown in the figure, a in one hand and b in the other, I release them simultaneously, and you see the result,\u2014they both meet at c: even if I bring a [Pg 298]up to e, and bring b down close to c, the result is the same. The motion of a is so rapid that it arrives at c just at the same instant as b. When I bring the two balls on the same side of c, and release them simultaneously, a overtakes b just at the moment when it is passing c. Hence, under all circumstances, the times of descent are equal.\n\n622. It will be noticed that the string attached to the ball b, in the position shown in the figure, is almost as free as if it were merely suspended from o, for it is only when the ball is some distance from the lowest point that the side arcs produce any appreciable effect in curving the string. The ball swings from b to c nearly in a circle of which the centre is at o. Hence, in the circular pendulum, the vibrations when small are isochronous, for in that case the cycloid and the circle become indistinguishable.[Pg 299]\n\nLECTURE XIX.\nTHE COMPOUND PENDULUM AND THE\nCOMPOSITION OF VIBRATIONS.\nThe Compound Pendulum.\u2014The Centre of Oscillation.\u2014The Centre of Percussion.\u2014The Conical Pendulum.\u2014The Composition of Vibrations.\n\nTHE COMPOUND PENDULUM.\n\nFig. 87.\n\n623. Pendulous motion must now be studied in other forms besides that of the simple pendulum, which consists of a weight and a cord. Any body rotating about an axis may be made to oscillate by gravity. A body thus vibrating is called a compound pendulum. The ideal form, which consists of an indefinitely small weight attached to a perfectly flexible and imponderable string, is an abstraction which can only be approximately imitated in nature. It follows that every pendulum used in our experiments is strictly speaking compound.\n\n624. The first pendulum of this class which we shall notice is that used in the common clock (Fig. 87). This consists of a wooden or steel rod a e, to which a brass or leaden bob b is attached. This pendulum is suspended by means of a steel spring c a, [Pg 300]which being very flexible, allows the vibration to be performed with considerable freedom. The use of the screw at the end will be explained in Art. 664. A pendulum like this vibrates isochronously, when the amplitude is small, but it is not easy to see precisely what is the length of the simple pendulum which would oscillate in the same time. In the first place, we are uncertain as to the virtual position of the point of suspension, for the spring, though flexible, will not yield at the point c to the same extent as a string; thus the effective point of suspension must be somewhat lower than c. The other extremity is still more uncertain, for the weight, so far from being a single point, is not exclusively in the neighbourhood of the bob, inasmuch as the rod of the pendulum has a mass that is appreciable. This form of pendulum cannot therefore be used where it is necessary to determine the length with accuracy.\n\n  625. When the length of a pendulum is to be measured, we must adopt other means of supporting it than that of suspension by a spring, as otherwise we cannot have a definite point from which to measure. To illustrate the mode that is to be adopted, I take here an iron bar 6' long and 1\" square, which weighs 19 lbs. I wish to support this at one end so that it can vibrate freely, and at the same time have a definite point of suspension. I have here two small prisms of steel e (Fig. 88) fastened to a brass frame; the faces of the prisms meet at about an angle of 60\u00b0 and form the edges about which the oscillation takes place: this frame and the edges can be placed on the end of the bar, and can be fixed there by tightening two nuts. The object of [Pg 301]having the edges on a sliding frame is that they may be applicable to different parts of the bar with facility. In some instruments used in experiments requiring extreme delicacy, the edges which are attached to the pendulum are supported upon plates of agate; they are to be adjusted on the same horizontal line, and the pendulum really vibrates about this line, as about an axis. For our purpose it will be sufficient to support the edges upon small pieces of steel. a b, Fig. 88, represents one side of the top of the iron bar; e is the edge projecting from it, with its edge perpendicular to the bar. c d is a steel plate bearing a knife edge on its upper surface; this piece of steel is firmly secured to the framework. There is of course a similar piece on the other side, supporting the other edge. The bar, thus delicately poised, will, when once started, vibrate backwards and forwards for an hour, as there is very little friction between the edges and the pieces which support them.\n\n\nFig. 88.\n\n626. The general appearance of the apparatus, when mounted, is shown in Fig. 89. a b is the bar: at a the two edges are shown, and also the pieces of steel which support them. The whole is carried by a horizontal beam bolted to two uprights; and a glance at the figure will explain the arrangements made to secure the steadiness of the apparatus; the second pair of edges shown at b will be referred to presently (Art. 635).\n\n627. This bar, as you see, vibrates to and fro; and we shall determine the length of a simple pendulum which would vibrate in the same period [Pg 302]of time. The length might be deduced by finding the time of vibration, and then calculating from Art. 606. This would be the most accurate mode of proceeding, but I have preferred to adopt a direct method which does not require calculation. A simple pendulum, consisting of a fine cord and a small iron sphere c, is mounted behind the edge, Fig. 89. The point from which the cord is suspended lies exactly in the line of the two edges, and there is an adjustment for lengthening or shortening the cord at pleasure.\n\n\nFig. 89.\n\n[Pg 303]628. We first try with 6' of cord, so that the simple pendulum shall have the same length as the bar. Taking the ball in one hand and the bar in the other, I draw them aside, and you see, when they are released, that the bar performs two vibrations and returns to my hand before the ball. Hence the length of the isochronous simple pendulum is certainly less than the length of the bar; for a pendulum of that length is too slow.\n\n629. I now shorten the cord until it is only half the length of the bar; and, repeating the experiment, we find that the ball returns before the bar, and therefore the simple pendulum is too short. Hence we learn that the isochronous pendulum is greater than half the length of the bar, and less than the whole length.\n\n630. Let us finally try a simple pendulum two-thirds of the length of the bar. I make the experiment, and find that the ball and the bar return to my hand precisely at the same instant. Therefore two-thirds of the length of the bar is the length of the isochronous simple pendulum.\n\nWe may state generally that the time of vibration of a uniform bar about one end equals that of a simple pendulum whose length is two-thirds of the bar; no doubt the bar we have used is not strictly uniform, because of the edges; but in the positions they occupy, their influence on the time of vibrations is imperceptible.\n\n632. For this rule to be verified, it is essentially necessary that the edges be properly situated on the bar; to illustrate this we may examine the oscillations of the small rod, shown at d (Fig. 89). This rod is also of iron 24\" \u00d7 0\"\u00b75 \u00d7 0\"\u00b75, and it is suspended from a point near the centre by a pair of edges; if the edges could be placed so that the centre of gravity of the whole lay in the line of the edges, it is evident that the bar would rest indifferently however [Pg 304]it were placed, and would not oscillate. If then the edges be very near the centre of gravity, we can easily understand that the oscillations may be very slow, and this is actually the case in the bar d. By the aid of the stop-watch, I find that one hundred vibrations are performed in 248 seconds, and that therefore each vibration occupies 2\u00b748 seconds. The length of the simple pendulum which has 2\u00b748 seconds for its period of oscillation, is about 20'. Had the edges been at one end, the length of the simple pendulum would have been\n\n24\" \u00d7 \u2154 = 16\".\n\nA bar 72\" long will vibrate in a shorter time when the edge is 15\"\u00b72 from one end than when it has any other position. The length of the corresponding simple pendulum is 41\"\u00b76.\n\nTHE CENTRE OF OSCILLATION.\n633. It appears that corresponding to each compound pendulum we have a specific length equal to that of the isochronous simple pendulum. To take as example the 6' bar already described (Art. 625), this length is 4'. If I measure off from the edges a distance of 4', and mark this point upon the bar, the point is called the centre of oscillation. More generally the centre of oscillation is found by drawing a line equal to the isochronous simple pendulum from the centre of oscillation through the centre of gravity.\n\n634. In the bar d the centre of oscillation would be at a distance of 20' below the edges; and in general the position will vary with the position of the edges.\n\n  635. In the 6' bar b is the centre of oscillation. I take another pair of edges and place them on the bar, so that the line of [Pg 305]the edges passes through b. I now lift the bar carefully and turn it upside down, so that the edges b rest upon the steel plates. In this position one-third of the bar is above the axis of suspension, and the remaining two-thirds below. a is of course now at the bottom of the bar, and is on a level with the ball, c: the pendulum is made to oscillate about the edges b, and the time of its vibration may be approximately determined by direct comparison with c, as already explained. I find that, when I allow c and the bar to swing together, they both vibrate precisely in the same time. You will remember, that when the ball was suspended by a string 4' long, its vibrations were isochronous with those of the bar when suspended from the edges a. Without having altered c, but having made the bar to vibrate about b, I find that the time of oscillation of the bar is still equal to that of c. Therefore, the period of oscillation about a is equal to that about b. Hence, when the bar is vibrating about b, its centre of oscillation must be 4' from b, that is, it must be at a: so that when the bar is suspended from a, the centre of oscillation is b; while, when the bar is suspended from b, the centre of oscillation is a. This is an interesting dynamical theorem. It may be more concisely expressed by saying that the centre of oscillation and the centre of suspension are reciprocal.\n\n636. Though the proof that we have given of this curious law applies only to a uniform bar, yet the law is itself true in general, whatever be the nature of the compound pendulum.\n\n  637. We alluded in the last lecture (Art. 610) to the difficulty of measuring with accuracy the length of a simple pendulum; but the reciprocity of the centres of oscillation and suspension, suggested to the ingenious Captain Kater a method by which this difficulty could be [Pg 306]evaded. We shall explain the principle. Let one pair of edges be at a. Let the other pair of edges, b, be moved as near as possible to the centre of oscillation. We can test whether b has been placed correctly: for the time taken by the pendulum to perform 100 vibrations about a should be equal to the time taken to perform 100 vibrations about b. If the times are not quite equal, b must be moved slightly until the times are properly brought to equality. The length of the isochronous simple pendulum is then equal to the distance between the edges a and b; and this distance, from one edge to the other edge, presents none of the difficulties in its exact measurement which we had before to contend with: it can be found with precision. Hence, knowing the length of the pendulum and its time of oscillation, gravity can be found in the manner already explained (Art. 608).\n\n638. I have adjusted the two edges of the 6' bar as nearly as I could at the centres of oscillation and suspension, and we shall proceed to test the correctness of the positions. Mounting the bar first by the edges at a, I set it vibrating. I take the stop-watch already referred to (Art. 612), and record the position of its hands. I then place my finger on the stud, and, just at the moment when the bar is at the middle of one of its vibrations, I start the watch. I count a hundred vibrations; and when the pendulum is again at the middle of its stroke, I stop the watch, and find it records an interval of 110\u00b74 seconds. Thus the time of one vibration is 1\u00b7104 seconds. Reversing the bar, so that it vibrates about its centre of oscillation b, I now find that 110\u00b70 is the time occupied by one hundred vibrations counted in the same manner as before; hence 1\u00b7100 seconds is the time of one vibration about b: thus, the periods of the vibrations are very nearly equal, as they differ only by \u00b9/\u2082\u2085\u2080th part of a second.[Pg 307]\n\n639. It would be difficult to render the times of oscillation exactly equal by merely altering the position of B. In Kater\u2019s pendulum the two knife-edges are first placed so that the periods are as nearly equal as possible. The final adjustments are given by moving a small sliding-piece on the bar until it is found that the times of vibration about the two edges are identical. We shall not, however, use this refinement in a lecture experiment; I shall adopt the mean value of 1\u00b7102 seconds. The distance of the knife-edges is about 3'\u00b7992; hence gravity may be found from the expression (Art. 608)\n\n3'\u00b7992 \u00d7 (3\u00b71416 / 1.102)\u00b2.\n\nThe value thus deduced is 32'\u00b74, which is within a small fraction of the true value.\n\n640. With suitable precautions Kater\u2019s pendulum can be made to give a very accurate result. It is to be adjusted so that there shall be no perceptible difference in the number of vibrations in twenty-four hours, whichever edge be the axis of suspension: the distance between the edges is then to be measured with the last degree of precision by comparison with a proper standard.\n\nTHE CENTRE OF PERCUSSION.\n\nFig. 90.\n\n641. The centre of oscillation in a body free to rotate about a fixed axis is identical with another remarkable point, called the centre of percussion. We proceed to examine some of the properties of a body thus suspended with reference to the effects of a blow. For the purposes of these experiments the method of suspension by edges is however quite unsuited.[Pg 308]\n\n642. We shall first use a rod suspended from a pin about which the rod can rotate. a b, Fig. 90, is a pine rod 48\" \u00d7 1\" \u00d7 1\", free to turn round b. Suppose this rod be hanging vertically at rest. I take a stick in my hand, and, giving the rod a blow, an impulsive shock will instantly be communicated to the pin at b; but the actual effect upon b will be very different according to the position at which the blow is given. If I strike the upper part of the rod at d, the action of a b upon the pin is a pressure to the left. If I strike the lower part at a, the pressure is to the right. But if I strike the point c, which is distant from b by two-thirds of the length of the rod, there is no pressure upon the pin. Concisely, for a blow below c, the pressure is to the right; for one above c, it is to the left; for one at c it is nothing.\n\n643. We can easily verify this by holding one extremity of a rod between the finger and thumb of the left hand, and striking it in different places with a stick held in the right hand; the pressure of the rod, when struck, will be so felt that the circumstances already stated can be verified.\n\n\nFig. 91.\n\n644. A more visible way of investigating the subject is shown in Fig. 91. f b is a rod of wood, suspended from a beam by the string f g. A piece of paper is fastened to the rod at f by means of a small slip of wood clamped firmly to the rod; the other ends of this piece of paper are similarly clamped at p and q.\n\n645. When the rod receives a blow on the right-hand side at a, we find that the piece of paper is broken across at e, because the end f has been driven by the blow towards q, and consequently caused the fracture of the paper at a place, e, [Pg 309]where it had been specially narrowed. I remove the pieces of paper, and replace them by a new piece precisely similar. I now strike the rod at b,\u2014a smart tap is all that is necessary,\u2014and the piece of paper breaks at d. Finally replacing the pieces of paper by a third piece, I find that when I give the rod a tap (not a violent blow) at c, neither d nor e are broken.\n\n646. This point c, where the rod can receive a blow without producing a shock upon the axis of suspension is the centre of percussion. We see, from its being two-thirds of the length of the rod distant from f, that it is identical with the centre of oscillation of the rod, if vibrating about knife-edges at f. It is true in general, whatever be the shape of the body, that the centre of oscillation is identical with the centre of percussion.\n\n647. The principle embodied in the property of the centre of percussion has many practical applications. Every cricketer well knows that there is a part of his bat from which the ball flies without giving his hands any unpleasant feeling. The explanation is simple. The bat is a body suspended from the hands of the batman; and if the ball be struck with the centre of percussion of the bat, there is no shock experienced. The [Pg 310]centre of percussion in a hammer lies in its head, consequently a nail can receive a violent blow with perfect comfort to the hand which holds the handle.\n\nTHE CONICAL PENDULUM.\n  648. I have here a tripod (Fig. 92) which supports a heavy ball of cast iron by a string 6' long. If I withdraw the ball from its position of rest, and merely release it, the ball vibrates to and fro, the string continues in the same plane, and the motion is that already discussed in the circular pendulum. If at the same instant that I release the ball, I impart to it a slight push in a direction not passing through the position of rest, the ball describes a curved path, returning to the point from which it started. This motion is that of the conical pendulum, because the string supporting the ball describes a cone.\n\n649. In order to examine the nature of the motion, we can make the ball depict its own path. At the opposite point of the ball to that from which it is suspended, a hole is drilled, and in this I have fitted a camel\u2019s hair paint-brush filled with ink. I bring a sheet of paper on a drawing-board under the vibrating ball; and you see the brush traces an ellipse upon the paper, which I quickly withdraw.\n\n650. By starting the ball in different ways, I can make it describe very different ellipses: here is one that is extremely long and narrow, and here another almost circular. When the magnitude of the initial velocity is properly adjusted, and its direction is perpendicular to the radius, I can make the string describe a right cone, and the ball a horizontal circle, but it requires some care and several trials in order to succeed in this. The ellipse may also become very narrow, so [Pg 311]that we pass by insensible gradations to the circular pendulum, in which the brush traces a straight line.\n\n\nFig. 92.\n\n651. When the ball is moving in a circle, its velocity is uniform; when moving in an ellipse, its velocity is greatest at the extremities of the least axes of this ellipse, and least at the extremities of the greatest axes; but, when the ball is vibrating to and fro, as in the [Pg 312]ordinary circular pendulum, the velocity is greatest at the middle of each vibration, and vanishes of course each time the pendulum attains the extremity of its swing. It is worthy of notice that under all circumstances the brush traces an ellipse upon the paper; for the circle and the straight line are only extreme cases, the one being a very round ellipse and the other a very thin one. If, however, the arc of vibration be large the movement is by no means so simple.\n\n652. How are we to account for the elliptic movement? To do so fully would require more calculation than can be admitted here, but we may give a general account of the phenomenon.\n\nLet us suppose that the ellipse a c b d, Fig. 93, is the path described by a particle when suspended by a string from a point vertically above o, the centre of the ellipse. To produce this motion I withdraw the particle from its position of rest at o to a. If merely released, the particle would swing over to b, and back again to a; but I do not simply release it, I impart a velocity impelling it in the direction a t. Through o draw c d parallel to a t. If I had taken the particle at o, and, without withdrawing it from its position of rest, had started it off in the direction o d, the particle would continue for ever to vibrate backwards and forwards from c to d. Hence, when I release the particle at a, and give it a velocity in the direction a t, the particle commences to move under the action of two distinct vibrations, one parallel to a b, the other parallel to c d, and we have to find the effect of these two vibrations impressed simultaneously upon the same particle. They are performed in the same time, since all vibrations are isochronous. We must conceive one motion starting from a a towards o at the same moment that the other commences to start from o towards d. [Pg 313]After the lapse of a short time, the body has moved through a y in its oscillation towards o, and in the same time through o z in its oscillation towards d; it is therefore found at x. Now, when the particle has moved through a distance equal and parallel to a o, it must be found at the point d, because the motion from o to d takes the same time as from a to o. Similarly the body must pass through b, because the time occupied by going from a to b, would have been sufficient for the journey from o to d, and back again. The particle is found at p, because, after the vibration returning from b has arrived at q, the movement from d to o has travelled on to r. In this way the particle may be traced completely round its path by the composition of the two motions. It can be proved that for small motions the path is an ellipse, by reasoning founded upon the fact that the vibrations are isochronous.\n\n\nFig. 93.\n\n653. Close examination reveals a very interesting circumstance connected with this experiment. It may be observed that the ellipse described by the body is not quite fixed in position, but that it [Pg 314]gradually moves round in its plane. Thus, in Fig. 92, the ellipse which is being traced out by the brush will gradually change its position to the dotted line shown on the board. The axis of the ellipse revolves in the same direction as that in which the ball is moving. This phenomenon is more marked with an ellipse whose dimensions are considerable in proportion to the length of the string. In fact, if the ellipse be very small, the change of position is imperceptible. The cause of this change is to be found in the fact already mentioned (Art. 598), that though the vibrations of a pendulum are very nearly isochronous, yet they are not absolutely so; the vibrations through a long arc taking a minute portion of time longer than those through a short arc.\n\nThis difference only becomes appreciable when the larger arc is of considerable magnitude with reference to the length of the pendulum.\n\n\nFig. 94.\n\n654. How this causes displacement of the ellipse may be explained by Fig. 94. The particle is describing the figure a d c b in the direction shown by the arrows. This motion may be conceived to be compounded of vibrations a c and b d, if we imagine the particle to have been started from a with the right velocity perpendicular to o a. At the point a, the entire motion is for the instant perpendicular to o a; in fact, the motion is then exclusively due to the vibration b d, and there is no movement parallel to o a. We may define the extremity of the major axis of the ellipse to be the position of the particle, when the motion parallel to that axis vanishes. Of course this applies equally to the other extremity of the axis c, and similarly at the points b or d there is no motion of the particle parallel to b d.\n\n  655. Let us follow the particle, starting from a until it [Pg 315]returns there again. The movement is compounded of two vibrations, one from a to c and back again, the other along b d; from o to d, then from d to b, then from b to o, taking exactly double the time of one vibration from d to b. If the time of vibration along a c were exactly equal to that along b d, these two vibrations would bring the particle back to a precisely under the original circumstances. But they do not take place in the same time; the motion along a c takes a shade longer, so that, when the motion parallel to a c has ceased, the motion along d b has gone past o to a point q, very near o. Let a p = o q, and when the motion parallel to a c has vanished, the particle will be found at p; hence p must be the extremity of the major axis of the ellipse. In the next revolution, the extremity of the axis will advance a little more, and thus the ellipse moves round gradually.\n\nTHE COMPOSITION OF VIBRATIONS.\n656. We have learned to regard the elliptic motion in the conical pendulum as compounded of two vibrations. The importance of the composition of vibrations justifies us in examining this subject experimentally in another way. The apparatus which we shall employ is represented in Fig. 95.\n\na is a ball of cast iron weighing 25 lbs., suspended from the tripod by a cord: this ball itself forms the support of another pendulum, b. The second pendulum is very light, being merely a [Pg 316]globe of glass filled with sand. Through a hole at the bottom of the glass the sand runs out upon a drawing-board placed underneath to receive it.\n\n\nFig. 95.\n\nThus the little stream of sand depicts its own journey upon the drawing-board, and the curves traced out thus indicate the path in which the bob of the second pendulum has moved.[Pg 317]\n\n\nFig. 96.\n\n657. If the lengths of the two pendulums be equal, and their vibrations be in different planes, the curve described is an ellipse, passing at one extreme into a circle, and at the other into a straight line. This is what we might have expected, for the two vibrations are each performed in the same time, and therefore the case is analogous to that of the conical pendulum of Art. 648.\n\n658. But the curve is of a very different character when the cords are unequal. Let us study in particular the case in which the second pendulum is only one-fourth the length of the cord supporting the iron ball. This is the experiment represented in Fig. 95. The form of the path delineated by the sand is shown in Fig. 96. The arrowheads placed upon the curve show the direction in which it is traced. Let us suppose that the formation of the figure commences at a; it then goes on to b, to o, to c, to d, and back to a: this shows us that the bob of the lower pendulum must have performed two vibrations up and down, while that of the upper has made one right and left. The motion is thus compounded of two vibrations at right angles, and the time of one is half that of the other.\n\nThe time of vibration is proportional to the square root of the length; and, since the lower pendulum is one-fourth the length of the upper, its time of vibration is one-half that of the upper. In this experiment, therefore, we have a confirmation of the law of Art 605.[Pg 318]\n\nLECTURE XX.\nTHE MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES OF A CLOCK.\nIntroduction.\u2014The Compensating Pendulum.\u2014The Escapement.\u2014The Train of Wheels.\u2014The Hands.\u2014The Striking Parts.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n659. We come now to the most important practical application of the pendulum. The vibrations being always isochronous, it follows that, if we count the number of vibrations in a certain time, we shall ascertain the duration of that time. It is simply the product of the number of vibrations with the period of a single one. Let us take a pendulum 39\u00b7139 inches long; which will vibrate exactly once a second in London, and is therefore called a seconds pendulum (See Art. 607). If I set one of these pendulums vibrating, and contrive mechanism by which the number of its vibrations shall be recorded, I have a means of measuring time. This is of course the principle of the common clock: the pendulum vibrates once a second and the number of vibrations made from one epoch [Pg 319]to another epoch is shown by the hands of the clock. For example, when the clock tells me that 15 minutes have elapsed, what it really shows is that the pendulum has made 60 \u00d7 15 = 900 vibrations, each of which has occupied one second.\n\n660. One duty of the clock is therefore to count and record the number of vibrations, but the wheels and works have another part to discharge, and that is to sustain the motion of the pendulum. The friction of the air and the resistance experienced at the point of suspension are forces tending to bring the pendulum to rest; and to counteract the effect of these forces, the machine must be continually invigorated with fresh energy. This supply is communicated by the works of the clock, which will be sufficiently described presently.\n\n661. When the weight driving the clock is wound up, a store of energy is communicated which is doled out to the pendulum in a very small impulse, at every vibration. The clock-weight is just large enough to be able to counterbalance the retarding forces when the pendulum has a proper amplitude of vibration. In all machines there is some energy lost in maintaining the parts in motion in opposition to friction and other resistances; in clocks this represents the whole amount of the force, as there is no external work to be performed.\n\nTHE COMPENSATING PENDULUM.\n662. The actual length of the pendulum used, depends upon the purposes for which the clock is intended, but it is essential for correct performance that the pendulum should vibrate at a constant rate; a small irregularity in this respect may appreciably affect the indications of the clock. If the pendulum vibrates in 1\u00b7001 seconds [Pg 320]instead of in one second, the clock loses one thousandth of a second at each beat; and, since there are 86,400 seconds in a day, it follows that the pendulum will make only 86,400 - 86\u00b73 vibrations in a day, and therefore the clock will lose 86\u00b73 seconds, or nearly a minute and a half daily.\n\n663. For accurate time-keeping it is therefore essential that the time of vibration shall remain constant. Now the time of vibration depends upon the length, and therefore it is necessary that the length of the pendulum be absolutely unalterable. If the length of the pendulum be changed even by one-tenth of an inch, the clock will lose or gain nearly two minutes daily, according to whether the pendulum has been made longer or shorter. In general we may say that, if the alteration in the length amount to k thousandths of an inch, the number of seconds gained or lost per day is 1\u00b7103 \u00d7 k with a seconds pendulum.\n\n  664. This explains the practice of raising the bob of the pendulum when the clock is going too slow or lowering it when going too fast. If the thread of the screw used in doing this have twenty threads to the inch; then one complete revolution of the screw will raise the bob through 50 thousandths of an inch, and therefore the effect on the rate will be 1\u00b7103 \u00d7 50 = 55 nearly. Thus, the rate of the clock will be altered by about 55 seconds daily. Whatever be the screw, its effect can be calculated by the simple rule expressed as follows. Divide 1103 by the number of threads to the inch; the quotient is the number of seconds that the clock can be made to gain or lose daily by one revolution of the screw on the bob of the pendulum.\n\n665. Let us suppose that the length of the pendulum has been properly adjusted so that the clock keeps accurate time. It is necessary that the pendulum should not alter in length. But there is an ever-present [Pg 321]cause tending to change it. That cause is the variation of temperature. We shall first illustrate by actual experiment the well known law that bodies expand under the action of heat; then we shall consider the irregularities thus introduced into the motion of the pendulum; and, finally, we shall point out means by which these irregularities may be effectually counteracted.\n\n\nFig. 97.\n\n666. We have here a brass bar a yard long; it is at present at the temperature of the room. If we heat the bar over a lamp, it becomes longer; but upon cooling, it returns to its original dimensions. These alterations of length are very small, indeed too small to be perceived except by careful measurement; but we shall be able to demonstrate in a simple way that elongation is the consequence of increased temperature. I place the bar a d in the supports shown in Fig. 97. It is firmly secured at b by means of a binding screw, and passes [Pg 322]quite freely through c; if the bar elongate when it is heated by the lamp, the point d must approach nearer to e. At h is an electric battery, and g is a bell rung by an electric current. One wire of the battery connects h and g, another connects g with e, and a third connects h with the end of the brass rod b. Until the electric current becomes completed, the bell remains dumb, the current is not closed until the point touches e: when this is the case, the current rushes from the battery along the bar, then from d to e, from that through the bell, and so back to the battery. At present the point is not touching e, though extremely close thereto. Indeed if I press e towards the point, you hear the bell, showing that the circuit is complete; removing my finger, the bell again becomes silent, because e springs back, and the current is interrupted.\n\n667. I place the lamp under the bar: which begins to heat and to elongate; and as it is firmly held at b, the point gradually approaches e: it has now touched e; the circuit is complete, and the bell rings. If I withdraw the lamp, the bar cools. I can accelerate the cooling by touching the bar with a damp sponge; the bar contracts, breaks the circuit, and the bell stops: heating the bar again with the lamp, the bell again rings, to be again stopped by an application of the sponge. Though you have not been able to see the process, your ears have informed you that heat must have elongated the bar, and that cold has produced contraction.\n\n668. What we have proved with respect to a bar of brass, is true for a bar of any material; and thus, whatever be the substance of which a pendulum is made, a simple uncompensated rod must be longer in hot weather than in cold weather: hence a clock will generally have a tendency to go faster in winter than in summer.[Pg 323]\n\n669. The amount of change thus produced is, it is true, very small. For a pendulum with a steel rod, the difference of temperature between summer and winter would cause a variation in the rate of five seconds daily, or about half a minute in the week. The amount of error thus introduced is of no great consequence in clocks which are only intended for ordinary use; but in astronomical clocks, where seconds or even portions of a second are of importance, inaccuracies of this magnitude would be quite inadmissible.\n\n\nFig. 98.\n\n670. There are, it is true, some substances\u2014for example, ordinary timber\u2014in which the rate of expansion is less than that of steel; consequently, the irregularities introduced by employing a pendulum with a wooden rod are less than those of the steel pendulum we have mentioned; but no substance is known which would not originate greater variations than are admissible in the performance of an astronomical clock.\n\nWe must, therefore, devise some means by which the effect of temperature on the length of a pendulum can be avoided. Various means have been proposed, and we shall describe one of the best and simplest.\n\n671. The mercurial pendulum (Fig. 98) is frequently used in clocks intended to serve as standard time-keepers. The rod by which the pendulum is suspended is made of steel; and the bob consists of a glass jar of mercury. The distance of the centre of gravity of the mercury from the point of suspension may practically be considered as the length of the pendulum. The rate of expansion of mercury is about sixteen times that of steel: hence, if the bob be formed of a column of mercury one-eighth part of the length of the steel rod, the compensation would be complete. For, suppose the temperature of the [Pg 324]pendulum be raised, the steel rod would be lengthened, and therefore the vase of mercury would be lowered; on the other hand, the column of mercury would expand by an amount double that of the steel rod: thus the centre of the column of mercury would be elevated as much as the steel was elongated; hence the centre of the mercury is raised by its own expansion as much as it is lowered by the expansion of the steel, and therefore the effective length of the pendulum remains unaltered. By this contrivance the time of oscillation of the pendulum is rendered independent of the temperature. The bob of the mercurial pendulum is shown in Fig. 98. The screw is for the purpose of raising or lowering the entire vessel of mercury in order to make the rate correct in the first instance.\n\nTHE ESCAPEMENT.\n  672. Practical skill as well as some theoretical investigation has been expended upon that part of a clock which is called the escapement, the excellence of which is essential to the correct performance of a timepiece. The pendulum must have its motion sustained by receiving an impulse at every vibration: at the same time it is desirable that the vibration should be hampered as little as possible by mechanical connection. The isochronism on which the time-keeping depends is in strictness only a characteristic of oscillations performed with a total freedom from constraint of every description; hence we must endeavour [Pg 325]to approximate the clock pendulum as nearly as possible to one which is swinging quite freely. To effect this, and at the same time to maintain the arc of vibration tolerably constant, is the property of a good escapement.\n\n\nFig. 99.\n\n673. A common form of escapement is shown in Fig. 99. The arrangement is no doubt different from that actually found in a clock; but I have [Pg 326]constructed the machine in this way in order to show clearly the action of the different parts. g is called the escapement-wheel: it is surrounded by thirty teeth, and turns round once when the pendulum has performed sixty vibrations,\u2014that is, once a minute. i represents the escapement; it vibrates about an axis and carries a fork at k which projects behind, and the rod of the pendulum hangs between its prongs. The pendulum is itself suspended from a point o. At n, h are a pair of polished surfaces called the pallets: these fulfil a very important function.\n\n674. The escapement-wheel is constantly urged to turn round by the action of the weight and train of wheels, of which we shall speak presently; but the action of the pallets regulates the rate at which the wheel can revolve. When a tooth of the wheel falls upon the pallet n, the latter is gently pressed away: this pressure is transmitted by the fork to the pendulum; as n moves away from the wheel, the other pallet h approaches the wheel; and by the time n has receded so far that the tooth slips from it, h has advanced sufficiently far to catch the tooth which immediately drops upon h. In fact, the moment the tooth is free from n, the wheel begins to revolve in consequence of the driving weight; but it is quickly stopped by another tooth falling on h: and the noise of this collision is the well known tick of the clock. The pendulum is still swinging to the left when the tooth falls on h. The pressure of the tooth then tends to push h outwards, but the inertia of the pendulum in forcing h inwards is at first sufficient to overcome the outward pressure arising from the wheel; the consequence is that, after the tooth has dropped, the escapement-wheel moves back a little, or \u201crecoils,\u201d as it is called. If you look at any ordinary clock, which [Pg 327]has a second-hand, you will notice that after each second is completed the hand recoils before starting for the next second. The reason of this is, that the second-hand is turned directly by the escapement-wheel, and that the inertia of the pendulum causes the escapement-wheel to recoil. But the constant pressure of the tooth soon overcomes the inertia of the pendulum, and h is gradually pushed out until the tooth is able to \u201cescape\u201d; the moment it does so the wheel begins to turn round, but is quickly brought up by another tooth falling on n, which has moved sufficiently inwards.\n\nThe process we have just described then recurs over again. Each tooth escapes at each pallet, and the escapements take place once a second; hence the escapement-wheel with thirty teeth will turn round once in a minute.\n\n675. When the tooth is pushing n, the pendulum is being urged to the left; the instant this tooth escapes, another tooth falls on h, and the pendulum, ere it has accomplished its swing to the left, has a force exerted upon it to bring it to the right. When this force and gravity combined have stopped the pendulum, and caused it to move to the right, the tooth soon escapes at h, and another tooth falls on n, then retarding the pendulum. Hence, except during the very minute portion of time that the wheel turns after one escapement, and before the next tick, the pendulum is never free; it is urged forwards when its velocity is great, but before it comes to the end of its vibration it is urged backwards; this escapement does not therefore possess the characteristics which we pointed out (Art. 672) as necessary for a really good instrument. But for ordinary purposes of time-keeping, the recoil escapement works sufficiently well, as the force which acts upon the pendulum is in reality extremely small. For [Pg 328]the refined applications of the astronomical clock, the performance of a recoil escapement is inadequate.\n\nThe obvious defect in the recoil is that the pendulum is retarded during a portion of its vibration; the impulse forward is of course necessary, but the retarding force is useless and injurious.\n\n676. The \u201cdead-beat\u201d escapement was devised by the celebrated clockmaker Graham, in order to avoid this difficulty. If you observe the second-hand of a clock, controlled by this escapement, you will understand why it is called the dead beat: there is no recoil; the second-hand moves quickly over each second, and remains there fixed until it starts for the next second.\n\nThe wheel and escapement by which this effect is produced is shown in Fig. 100. a and b are the pallets, by the action of the teeth on which the motion is given to the crutch, which turns about the centre o; from the axis through this centre the fork descends, so that as the crutch is made to vibrate to and fro by the wheel, the fork is also made to vibrate, and thus sustain the motion of the pendulum. The essential feature in which the dead-beat escapement differs from the recoil escapement is that when the tooth escapes from the pallet a, the wheel turns: but the tooth which in the recoil escapement would have fallen on the other pallet, now falls on a surface d, and not on the pallet b. d is part of a circle with its centre at o, the centre of motion; consequently, the tooth remains almost entirely inert so long as it remains on the circular arc d.\n\n677. There is thus no recoil, and the pendulum is allowed to reach the extremity of its swing to the right unretarded; but when the pendulum is returning, the crutch moves until the tooth passes from the circular arc d on to the pallet b: [Pg 329]instantly the tooth slides down the pallet, giving the crutch an impulse, and escaping when the point has traversed b. The next tooth that comes into action falls upon the circular arc c, of which the centre is also at o; this tooth likewise remains at rest until the pendulum has finished its swing, and has commenced its return; then the tooth slides down a, and the process recommences as before.\n\n\nFig. 100.\n\n678. The operations are so timed that the pendulum receives its impulse (which takes place when a tooth slides down a pallet) precisely when the oscillation is at the point of greatest velocity; the pendulum is then unacted upon till it reaches a similar position in the next vibration. This impulse at the middle of the swing does not affect the time of vibration.[Pg 330]\n\n679. There is still a small frictional force acting to retard the pendulum. This arises from the pressure of the teeth upon the circular arcs, for there is a certain amount of friction, no matter how carefully the surfaces may be polished. It is not however found practically to be a source of appreciable irregularity.\n\nIn a clock furnished with a dead-beat escapement and a mercurial pendulum, we have a superb time-keeper.\n\nTHE TRAIN OF WHEELS.\n680. We have next to consider the manner in which the supply of energy is communicated to the escapement-wheel, and also the mode in which the vibrations of the pendulum are counted. A train of wheels for this purpose is shown in Fig. 99. The same remark may be made about this train that we have already made about the escapement,\u2014namely, that it is more designed to explain the principle clearly than to show the actual construction of a clock.\n\n  681. The weight a which animates the whole machine is attached to a rope, which is wound around a barrel b; the process of winding up the clock consists in raising this weight. On the same axle as the barrel b is a large tooth-wheel c; this wheel contains 200 teeth. The wheel c works into a pinion d, containing 20 teeth; consequently, when the wheel c has turned round once, the pinion d has turned round ten times. The large wheel e is on the same axle with the pinion d, and turns with d; the wheel e contains 180 teeth, and works into the pinion f, containing 30 teeth: consequently when e has gone round once, f will have turned round six times; and therefore, when the wheel c and the barrel b have made one revolution, the pinion f will have gone round sixty times; but the wheel g is on the same shaft as the pinion f, [Pg 331]and therefore, for every sixty revolutions of the escapement-wheel, the wheel c will have gone round once. We have already shown that the escapement-wheel goes round once a minute, and hence the wheel c must go round once in an hour. If therefore a hand be placed on the same axle with c, in front of a clock dial, the hand will go completely round once an hour; that is, it will be the minute-hand of the clock.\n\n682. The train of wheels serves to transmit the power of the descending weight and thus supply energy to the pendulum. In the clock model you see before you, the weight sustaining the motion is 56 lbs. The diameter of the escapement-wheel is about double that of the barrel, and the wheel turns round sixty times as fast as the barrel; therefore for every inch the weight descends, the circumference of the escapement-wheel must move through 120 inches. From the principle of work it follows that the energy applied at one end of a machine equals that obtained from the other, friction being neglected. The force of 56 lbs. is therefore, reduced to the one hundred-and-twentieth part of its amount at the circumference of the escapement-wheel. And as the friction is considerable; the actual force with which each tooth acts upon the pallet is only a few ounces.\n\n683. In a good clock an extremely minute force need only be supplied to the pendulum, so that, notwithstanding 86,400 vibrations have to be performed daily, one winding of the clock will supply sufficient energy to sustain the motion for a week.\n\nTHE HANDS.\n684. We shall explain by the model shown in Fig. 101, how the hour-hand and the minute-hand are made to revolve with different velocities about the same dial.[Pg 332]\n\n\nFig. 101.\n\ng is a handle by which I can turn round the shaft which carries the wheel f, and the hand b. There are 20 teeth in f, and it gears into another wheel, e, containing 80 teeth; the shaft which is turned by e carries a third wheel d, containing 25 teeth, and d works with a fourth c, containing 75 teeth, c is capable of turning freely round the shaft, so that the motion of the shaft does not affect it, except through the intervention of the wheels e, f, and d. To c another hand a is attached, which therefore turns round simultaneously with c. Let us compare the motion of the two hands a and b. We suppose that the handle g is turned twelve times; then, of course, the hand b, since it is on the shaft, will turn twelve times. The wheel f also turns twelve times, but e has four times the number of teeth that a has, and therefore, when f has gone round four times, e will only have gone round once: hence, when f has revolved twelve times, e will have gone round three times. d turns with e, and therefore the twelve revolutions of the handle will have turned d round three times, but since c has 75 teeth and d 25 teeth, c will have only made one revolution, while d has made three revolutions; [Pg 333]hence the hand a will have made only one revolution, while the hand b has made twelve revolutions.\n\nWe have already seen (Art. 681) how, by a train of wheels, one wheel can be made to revolve once in an hour. If that wheel be upon the shaft instead of the handle g, the hand b will be the minute-hand of the clock, and the hand a the hour-hand.\n\n685. The adjustment of the numbers of teeth is important, and the choice of wheels which would answer is limited. For since the shafts are parallel, the distance between the centres of f and e must equal that between the centres of c and of d. But it is evident that the distance from the centre of f to the centre of e is equal to the sum of the radii of the wheels f and e. Hence the sum of the radii of the wheels f and e must be equal to the sum of the radii of c and d. But the circumferences of circles are proportional to their radii, and hence the sum of the circumferences of f and e must equal that of c and d; it follows that the sum of the teeth in e and f must be equal to the sum of the teeth in c and d. In the present case each of these sums is one hundred.\n\n686. Other arrangements of wheels might have been devised, which would give the required motion; for example, if f were 20, as before, and e 240, and if c and d were each equal to 130, the sum of the teeth in each pair would be 260. e would only turn once for every twelve revolutions of f, and c and d would turn with the same velocity as e; hence the motion of the hand a would be one-twelfth that of b. This plan requires larger wheels than the train already proposed.\n\nTHE STRIKING PARTS.\n[Pg 334]687. We have examined the essential features of the going parts of the clock; to complete our sketch of this instrument we shall describe the beautiful mechanism by which the striking is arranged. The model which we represent in Fig. 102 is, as usual, rather intended to illustrate the principles of the contrivance than to be an exact counter-part of the arrangement found in clocks. Some of the details are not reproduced in the model; but enough is shown to explain the principle, and to enable the model to work.\n\n688. When the hour-hand reaches certain points on the dial, the striking is to commence; and a certain number of strokes must be delivered. The striking apparatus has both to initiate the striking and to control the number of strokes; the latter is by far the more difficult duty. Two contrivances are in common use; we shall describe that which is used in the best clocks.\n\n689. An essential feature of the striking mechanism in the repeating clock is the snail, which is shown at b. This piece must revolve once in twelve hours, and is, therefore, attached to an axle which performs its revolution in exactly the same time as the hour-hand of the clock. In the model, the striking gear is shown detached from the going parts, but it is easy to imagine how the snail can receive this motion. The margin of the snail is marked with twelve steps, numbered from one to twelve. The portions of the margin between each pair of steps is a part of the circumference of a circle, of which the axis of the snail is the centre. The correct figuring of the snail is of the utmost importance to the correct performance of the clock. Above the snail is a portion of a toothed wheel, f, called the rack; this contains about fourteen or fifteen teeth. When this wheel is free, it falls down until a pin comes in contact with the snail at b.[Pg 335]\n\n\nFig. 102.\n\n[Pg 336]690. The distance through which the rack falls depends upon the position of the snail; if the pin come in contact with the part marked i., as it does in the figure, the rack will descend but a small distance, while, if the pin fall on the part marked vii., the rack will have a longer fall: hence as the snail changes its position with the successive hours, so the distance through which the rack falls changes also. The snail is so contrived that at each hour the rack falls on a lower step than it does in the preceding hour; for example, during the hour of three o\u2019clock, the rack would, if allowed to fall, always drop upon the part of the snail marked iii., but, when four o\u2019clock has arrived, the rack would fall on the part marked iv.; it is to insure that this shall happen correctly that such attention must be paid to the form of the snail.\n\n691. a is a small piece called the \u201cgathering pallet\u201d; it is so placed with reference to the rack that, at each revolution of a, the pallet raises the rack one tooth. Thus, after the rack has fallen, the gathering pallet gradually raises it.\n\n692. On the same axle as the gathering pallet, and turning with it, is another piece c, the object of which is to arrest the motion when the rack has been raised, sufficiently. On the rack is a projecting pin; the piece c passes free of this pin until the rack has been lifted to its original height, when c is caught by the pin, and the mechanism is stopped. The magnitude of the teeth in the rack is so arranged with reference to the snail, that the number of lifts which the pallet must make in raising the rack is equal to the number marked upon the step of the snail upon which the rack had fallen; hence the snail has the effect of controlling the number of revolutions which the gathering pallet can make. The rack is retained by a detent f, after being raised each tooth.[Pg 337]\n\n693. The gathering pallet is turned by a small pinion of 27 teeth, and the pinion is worked by the wheel c, of 180 teeth. This wheel carries a barrel, to which a movement of rotation is given by a weight, the arrangement of which is evident: a second pinion of 27 teeth on the same axle with d is also turned by the large wheel c. Since these pinions are equal, they revolve with equal velocities. Over d the bell i is placed; its hammer e is so arranged that a pin attached to d strikes the bell once in every revolution of d. The action will now be easily understood. When the hour-hand reaches the hour, a simple arrangement raises the detent f; the rack then drops; the moment the rack drops, the gathering pallet commences to revolve and raises up the rack; as each tooth is raised a stroke is given to the bell, and thus the bell strikes until the piece c is brought to rest against the pin.\n\n694. The object of the fan h is to control the rapidity of the motion: when its blades are placed more or less obliquely, the velocity is lessened or increased.[Pg 338]\n\n[Pg 339]\n\nAPPENDIX I.\nThe formul\u00e6 in the tables on p. 73 and after can be deduced by two methods,\u2014one that of graphical construction, the other that of least squares. The first method is the more simple and requires but little calculation; though neatness and care are necessary in constructing the diagrams. The second method will be described for the benefit of those who possess the requisite mathematical knowledge. The formul\u00e6 used in the preparation of the tables have been generally deduced from the method of least squares, as the results are to a slight, though insignificant, extent more accurate than those of the method of graphical construction. This remark will explain why the figures in some of the formul\u00e6 are carried to a greater number of places of decimals than could be obtained by the other method.\n\nWe shall confine the numerical examples to Tables III. and IV., and show how the formul\u00e6 of these tables have been deduced by the two different methods.\n\nTables V., XIV., XVI., XXI., are to be found in the same manner as Table III.; and Tables VI., IX., X., XI., XV., XVII., XVIII., XIX., XX., XXI., XXII., in the same manner as Table IV.\n\nTHE METHOD OF GRAPHICAL CONSTRUCTION.\nTable III.\nA horizontal line aps, shown on a diminished scale in Fig. 103, is to be neatly drawn upon a piece of cardboard about 14\" \u00d7 6\". [Pg 340]A scale which reads to the hundredth of an inch is to be used in the construction of the figure. A pocket lens will be found convenient in reading the small divisions. By means of a pair of compasses and the scale, points are to be marked upon the line aps, at distances 1\"\u00b74, 2\"\u00b78, 4\"\u00b72, 5\"\u00b76, 7\"\u00b70, 8\"\u00b74, 9\"\u00b78, 11\"\u00b72 from the origin a. These distances correspond to the magnitudes of the loads placed upon the slide on the scale of 0\"\u00b71 to 1 lb. Perpendiculars to aps are to be erected at the points marked, and distances f\u2081, f\u2082, f\u2083, &c. set off upon these perpendiculars. These distances are to be equal, on the adopted scale, to the frictions for the corresponding loads. For example, we see from Table III., Experiment 3, that when the load upon the slide is 42 lbs., the friction is 12\u00b72 lbs.; hence the point f\u2083 is found by measuring a distance 4\"\u00b72 from a, and erecting a perpendicular 1\"22. Thus, for each of the loads a point is determined. The positions of these points should be indicated by making each of them the centre of a small circle 0\"\u00b71 diameter. These circles, besides neatly defining the points, will be useful in a subsequent part of the process.\n\n\nFig. 103.\n\nIt will be found that the points f\u2081, f\u2082, &c. are very nearly in a straight line. We assume that, if the apparatus and observations were perfect, the points would lie exactly in a straight line. The object of the construction is to determine the straight line, which on the whole is most close to all the points. If it be true that [Pg 341]the friction is proportional to the pressure, this line should pass through the origin a, for then the perpendicular which represents the friction is proportional to the line cut off from a, which represents the load. It will be found that a line at can be drawn through the origin a, so that all the points are in the immediate vicinity of this line, if not actually upon it. A string of fine black silk about 15\" long, stretched by a bow of wire or whalebone, is a convenient straight-edge for finding the required line. The circles described about the points f\u2081, f\u2082, &c. will facilitate the placing of the silk line as nearly as possible through all the points. It will not be found possible to draw a line through a, which shall intersect all the circles; the best line passes below but very near to the circles round f\u2081, f\u2082, f\u2083, f\u2084, touches the circle about f\u2085, intersects the circles about f\u2086 and f\u2087, and passes above the circle round f\u2088. The line should be so placed that its depth below the point which is most above it, is equal to the height at which it passes above the point which is most below it.\n\nFrom a measure as, a length of 10\", and erect the perpendicular st. We find by measurement that st is 2\"\u00b77. If, then, we suppose that the friction for any load is really represented by the distance cut off by the line at upon the perpendicular, it follows that\n\nF : R :: 2\"\u00b77 : 10\".\n\nor F = 0\u00b727 R.\n\nThis is the formula from which Table III. has been constructed.\n\nTable IV.\nBy a careful application of the silk bow-string, x y q can be drawn, which, itself in close proximity to a, passes more nearly through f\u2081, f\u2082, &c. than is possible for any line which passes exactly through a. x y q will be found not only to intersect all the small circles, but to cut off a considerable arc from each. Measure off x p a [Pg 342]distance of 10\", and erect the perpendicular p q; then, if R be the load, and F the corresponding friction, we must have from similar triangles\u2014\n\nF - \tAY\t \u00d7 1 lb.\n0\"\u00b71\t  =  \t PQ\nR\tPX\nBy measurement it is found that AY = 0\"\u00b714, and PQ = 2\"\u00b753.\n\nWe have, therefore,\n\nF = 1\u00b74 + 0\u00b7253 R.\n\nThis is practically the same formula as\n\nF = 1\u00b744 + 0\u00b7252 R,\n\nfrom which the table has been constructed. In fact, the column of calculated values of the friction might have been computed from the former, without appreciably differing from what is found in the table.\n\nTHE METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES.\nTable III.\nLet k be the coefficient of friction. It is impossible to find any value for k which will satisfy the equation,\n\nF - k R = 0,\n\nfor all the observed pairs of values of F and R. We have then to find the value for k which, upon the whole, best represents the experiments. F - k R is to be as near zero as possible for each pair of values of F and R.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of least squares, it is well known to mathematicians, the best value of k is that which makes\n\n(F\u2081 - k R\u2081)\u00b2 + (F\u2082 - k R\u2082)\u00b2 + &c. + (F\u2098 - k R\u2098)\u00b2\n\na minimum where f\u2081 and r\u2081, f\u2082 and r\u2082 &c. are the simultaneous values of f and r in the several experiments.[Pg 343]\n\nIn fact, it is easy to see that, if this quantity be small, each of the essentially positive elements,\n\n(F\u2081 - k R\u2081)\u00b2, &c.\n\nof which it is composed, must be small also, and that therefore\n\nF - k R\n\nmust always be nearly zero.\n\nDifferentiating the sum of squares and equating the differential coefficient to zero, we have according to the usual notation,\n\n\u03a3  R\u2081 (F\u2081 - k R\u2081) = 0;\n\nwhence k =  \t\u03a3 R\u2081 F\u2081\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 .\n\u03a3  R\u2081\u00b2\nThe calculation of k becomes simplified when (as is generally the case in the tables) the loads R\u2081, R\u2082, &c., R\u2098 are of the form,\n\nN, 2N, 3N &c., m N.\n\nIn this case,\n\n\u03a3 R\u2081 F\u2081 = N (F\u2081 + 2F\u2082  + 3F\u2083 + &c. + mF\u2098).\n\n\u03a3 R\u2081\u00b2 = N\u00b2 (1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + &c. + m\u00b2)\n\n \tm(m + 1) (2m +1)\n= N\u00b2 \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n \t6\n \t(F\u2081 + 2F\u2082 + &c. + mF\u2098)\n\u2234\u2003 k = 6 \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 .\n \tNm(m + 1) (2m + 1).\nIn the case of Table III.\n\nm = 8,\u2003N = 14,\n\nF\u2081 + 2F + 3F\u2083 + mF\u2098 = 770\u00b79;\n\nwhence\u2003 k = 0\u00b727.\n\nThus the formula F = 0\u00b727 R is deduced both by the method of least squares, and by the method of graphical construction.\n\nTable IV.\nThe formula for this table is to be deduced from the following considerations.\n\nNo values exist for x and y, so that the equation\n\nF = x + y R\n\n[Pg 344]shall be satisfied for all pairs of values of F and R, but the best values for x and y are those which make\n\n(F\u2081 - x - y R\u2081)\u00b2 + (F\u2082 - x - y R\u2082)\u00b2  + &c. + (F\u2098 - x - y R\u2098)\u00b2\n\na minimum.\n\nDifferentiating with respect to x and y, and equating the differential coefficients to zero, we have\n\n\u03a3 (F\u2081 - x - y R\u2081) = 0,\n\n\u03a3 R\u2081(F\u2081 - x - y R\u2081) = 0.\n\nThis gives two equations for the determination of x and y.\n\nSuppose, as is usually the case, the loads be of the form,\n\nN,  2N,  3N,  4N &c.  mN,\n\nand making\n\nA = F\u2081 + F\u2082 + F\u2083 + &c. + F\u2098\n\nB = F\u2081 +2F\u2082 + 3F\u2083 + &c. + mF\u2098,\n\nwe have the equations\n\n \tm(m + 1)\nA - mx - \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\t N y = 0,\n \t2\n \tm(m + 1)\t \tm(m + 1) (2m + 1)\nB - \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\t x - \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\t N y = 0.\n \t2\t \t6\nSolving these, we find\n\n \t2 + 4m\t \t6\nx = \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\t A - \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\t B,\n \tm\u00b2 - m\t \tm\u00b2 - m\n \t12\t B\t \t6\t A\ny = \t\u2014\u2014\u2014\t \u2014\t \u2003-\u2003\t\u2014\u2014\u2014\t \u2014\n \tm\u00b3 - m\t N\t \tm\u00b2 - m\t N\nIn the present case,\n\nm = 8,\u2003N = 14,\u2003A = 138\u00b74,\u2003B = 770\u00b79;\n\nwhence x = 1\u00b744\n\ny = 0\u00b7252,\n\nand we have the formula,\n\nF = 1\u00b744 + 0\u00b7252 R.\n\n[Pg 345]\n\nAPPENDIX II.\nDETAILS OF THE WILLIS APPARATUS USED IN\nILLUSTRATING THE FOREGOING LECTURES.\n\nThe ultimate parts of the various contrivances figured in this volume are mainly those invented by the late Professor Willis of Cambridge. They are minutely described and illustrated in a work written by him for the purpose under the title System of Apparatus for the use of Lecturers and Experimenters in Mechanical Philosophy, London, Weale & Co., 1851. This work has long been out of print. It may therefore be convenient if I give here a brief account of those parts of this admirable apparatus that I have found especially useful The illustrations have been copied from the plates in Professor Willis\u2019 book.[2]\n\nThe Willis system provides the means for putting versatile framework together with or without revolving gear for the purpose of mechanical illustration. Many parts which enter into the construction of the machine used at the lecture to-day will reappear to-morrow as essential parts of some totally different contrivance. The parts are sufficiently substantial to work thoroughly well. The scantlings and dimensions [Pg 346]generally have been so chosen as to produce models readily visible to a large class.\n\nIt will of course be understood that every model contains some one or more special parts such as the punch and die in Fig. 73, or the spring balance in Fig. 17, or the pulley-block in Fig. 33. But for the due exhibition of the operation of the machine a further quantity of ordinary framework and of moving mechanism is usually necessary. This material, which may be regarded as of a general type, it is the function of the Willis system to provide.\n\nThe Bolts.\u2014The system mainly owes its versatility and its steadiness to the use of the iron screw bolt for all attachments. The bolts used are \u215c diameter; the shape of the head is hemispherical and the shank must be square for a short distance from the head so that the bolt cannot turn round when passed through the slits of the brackets or rectangles. When the head of the bolt bears on a slit in one of the wooden pieces a circular iron washer 2\" in diameter, or a square washer 2\" on each side, is necessary to protect the wood from crushing. There is to be a square hole, in the washer to receive the square shank of the bolt and the thickness of the washers should be \u215b\". The nut is square or hexagonal, and should always have a washer underneath when screwed home with a spanner or screw-wrench. The most useful lengths are 2\", 4\", 6\". The proper kind are known commercially as coach-bolts, and they should be chosen with easy screws, for facility in erecting or modifying apparatus. At least two dozen of the intermediate size and a dozen of each of the others are required. For elaborate contrivances many more will be necessary.\n\nThe Bed.\n\n\nFig. 104.\n\nThe Beds.\u2014The simplest as well as the longest parts of the framework are called \u201cbeds\u201d (Fig. 104). Each bed is made of two wooden bars. These bars are united by strong screws passing through small blocks of hard wood so as to keep the bars full \u215c\" asunder, and thus allow the shanks of the bolts to pass freely through the slit The scantling of each bar is 2\u00bd\" \u00d7 1\u00bd\", and the beds are of various lengths [Pg 347]from 1' to 10' or even longer. The beds can be attached together in any required position by bolts 6\" long. The rectangles and the brackets are attached to the beds by 4\" bolts. In one conjunction or another the beds will be found represented in almost every figure in the book. We may specially refer to Figs. 20, 44, 48, 49, 50, 65, 83.\n\nThe Stool.\n\n\nFig. 105.\n\nThe Stool.\u2014Most of the larger pieces of apparatus have the stool as their foundation (see Figs. 11, 39, 102). It is often convenient as in Fig. 65 to employ a pair of stools, while one [Pg 348]stool superposed on another gives the convenient stand in Fig. 80. The stool is a stout wooden frame, providing a choice of slits to which beds or other pieces may be attached by bolts. The structure of the frame is shown in Fig. 105. It is 2' 6\" high and its extreme horizontal dimensions are 2' 6\" \u00d7 1' 9\" of which the greater is A E. In other words, the longer sides of the stool are those open at the top. Each top corner is strengthened by an iron plate of which a separate sketch is shown. The scantlings of the parts of the stool are as follows:\u2014The legs and horizontal top rails are 3\" \u00d7 2\u215b\". Two of these rails with the intervening \u215c\" slit make the top and legs to be 4\u215d\" wide. The bottom front rail I is 3\" wide and 4\" deep. The double side rails D, H are 1\u00be\" wide and 2\u00bd\" deep, being made thinner than the legs into which they are mortised in order to allow the washers of the bolts to pass behind them. The slits are to be full \u215c\" wide throughout. Beech or birch are very suitable materials, but softer woods will answer if large washers are invariably used.\n\nThe Rectangle.\n\n\nFig. 106.\n\nThe Rectangle.\u2014The useful element of the Willis system known by this name is of iron cast in one piece (Fig. 106). The rectangles are used in the attachment of beds to each other under special conditions, or they are often attached to the stools or to brackets. Indeed their uses are multifarious, see for examples Figs. 12, 58, 62, 89, 97, 102 and many others. The faces of the rectangle are 2\u00bd\" broad. The outside dimensions are 6\" and 9\", and the thickness of metal is \u215d\". Each side of the rectangle has the usual bolt slit \u215c\" clear. Rectangles of a larger size are often found useful, their weight makes them effective stands (see Figs. 35, 43, 52, 65).\n\nThe Toothed Wheel.\u2014The most convenient type of toothed wheel for our present purpose is that known as the cast iron ten-pitch. In all such wheels the number of teeth is simply ten times the number of inches in the diameter. For example a wheel with 120 teeth is 12 inches in diameter. A number of ten-pitch wheels large and small must be [Pg 349]provided. The actual assortment that will be necessary depends upon circumstances. For most purposes it will be sufficient to have the multiples of 5 from 25 upwards to 120, and then a few larger sizes such as 150, 180, 200. Duplicates of the constantly recurring numbers such as 30, 60, 120 are convenient. Arm wheels are always preferable to plate wheels in lightness and appearance as well as in price. All wheels are to be 1\" thick at the boss which is faced in the latter at each side, and bored with a hole full 1\" diameter, in which a key groove is cut. A pair of mitre wheels such as are used in Fig. 80 are sometimes useful.\n\nThe\nStud Socket.\n\n\nFig. 107.\n\nThe Pulley.\u2014We have frequent occasion to use the pulley for conveying a cord, and a somewhat varied stock is convenient Thus light brass pulleys are used in the apparatus shown in Fig. 3, and a stout pulley in Fig. 71. A cast iron pulley about 10\" in diameter is seen in Figs. 32 and 34. It is bored 1\" in diameter with a key groove, and the boss is 1\" thick. Some small pulley-blocks similar to those used on yachts are often very useful.\n\nThe Stud Socket.\u2014For mounting toothed wheels on the larger pulleys or for almost any rotating or oscillating pieces the stud socket is used (see Fig. 107). The socket A B may be made of brass or of cast iron. It is 1\" in diameter so as to pass through the bosses of the wheels that have been bored to 1\" with this object:\u2014The socket is provided with a shoulder at one end (A) which is 1\u00bd\" diameter, and with a strong screw B and octagonal nut at the other end. The extreme length of the socket is 3\u00bd\", and the plain part of the 1\" cylinder is 1\u00be\" long. When two wheels are placed on the socket each of which has a boss 1\" thick, the tightening of the nut will secure the wheels against the shoulder. A feather is screwed on the plain part which enters the key grooves in the wheels, and thus ensures that the wheels shall turn [Pg 350]together. This feather should be small enough to slip easily into the key groove. If only a single wheel or if any peculiar piece such as a wooden cam or a disk of sheet iron has to be mounted, then collars or large thick washers must be placed on the socket so as permit the screw to bind the whole together. The socket revolves upon a stout iron stud C D, which is \u215d\" in diameter. It bears a shoulder or flange C at the back of the same diameter as the base of the socket The stud bears on the other side of the shoulder a strong screw and nut which project 1\u215d\" so as to allow the stud to be secured in a hole 1\" deep in one of the brackets (to be presently described). The plain part of this screw near the shoulder must be \u215d\" diameter. The front end of the stud is pierced with a hole to receive a spring pin to keep the socket from sliding off the stud. Among the many applications of the stud socket we may mention those shown in Figs. 30, 73, 74.\n\nBracket No. I.\n\n\nFig. 108.\n\n\nBracket No. II.\n\n\nFig. 109.\n\n\nBracket No. III.\n\n\nFig. 110.\n\nThe Bracket.\u2014There are six different forms of cast iron brackets represented in the adjoining figures (Figs. 108-113).\n\nThe brackets are primarily intended as the supports of the stud sockets. For this purpose each has a head 1\" thick bored with a hole \u215d\" diameter, and thus fitted to receive the screw on any of the studs. Each bracket stands on a base or sole with a slit full \u215d\" wide for the bolts. The thickness of the sole is \u215d\". The larger of the [Pg 351]brackets I., II., and IV. have also slits in their vertical faces. Brackets can be fastened either to the stool or to the beds or rectangles, and the variety of their forms enables the wheel-work carried on the stud sockets to be disposed in any desired fashion. Brackets avail for many other purposes besides those of supporting rotating mechanism. (Look at Figs. 11, 12, 17, 20, 33, 38, 39, 73 and many others.)\n\nBracket No. IV.\n\n\nFig. 111.\n\n\nBracket No. V.\n\n\nFig. 112.\n\n\nBracket No. VI.\n\n\nFig. 113.\n\nThe Tube Fitting.\n\n\nFig. 114.\n\nThe Shafts and Tube-fittings.\u2014The stud sockets will not provide for every case in which wheels have to be mounted and driven. We must often employ shafts (see for instance Figs. 30, 47, 101). The shafts we use are turned iron rods \u00be\" in diameter, and of various lengths from 6\" up to 4'. To support the shafts we use for bearings the tube fitting (Fig. 114). This is a brass casting which consists of a tube M N 2\" long, and 1\u00bc\" in external diameter, bored \u00be\" so as to fit the shaft. The back of this tube is a flat surface parallel to the bore, and from it projects a screw \u215d\" diameter, and 1\u215d\" long with a nut which is however omitted in the drawing. This screw may be of the same size as that of the studs, and it is intended for the same purpose, namely to attach the bearing to the hole in a bracket. The tube may of course be fixed at any desired angle in the plane parallel to the face of the bracket. To prevent the endlong motion of the shaft cast iron or [Pg 352]brass rings are employed (Fig. 115). These are bored \u00be\", and furnished with a binding screw by which they may be tightened on the shaft in any position. To avoid injury to the shaft it is well to have a narrow flat surface filed along it to receive the end of the binding screw. The use of the rings is shown in Fig. 47. If as often happens (see for example Fig. 102) a barrel has to be set in motion by a shaft the required attachment can be made by simply slipping on the barrel, and then putting at each end of it two of the pinned rings (Fig. 115). The pins enter holes bored into the barrel for their reception so that when the rings are bound to the shaft by their screws the barrel must revolve with the shaft.\n\nThe Pinned Ring.\n\n\nFig. 115.\n\nThe Adapter.\n\n\nFig. 116.\n\nThe Adapter.\u2014For the attachment of wheels or other rotating pieces to the shaft an adapter is employed (Fig. 116). It is bored with a \u00be\" hole to fit the shaft, and the external diameter is 1\". At one end is a shoulder through which the binding screw is tapped, and there is a nut and screw at the opposite end. A feather will prevent the wheel from turning round on the adapter which is itself made to revolve with the shaft by screwing the binding screw down on the shaft. Some adapters are only large enough for a single wheel 1\" thick in the boss, but it is useful to have others that will take two wheels. Adapters are shown in use in Figs. 46 and 101.\n\nThe Lever Arm.\n\n\nFig. 117.\n\nThe Lever Arm.\u2014To give motion to the mechanism a lever arm with a handle is frequently required (Fig. 117). It is bored 1\" and has a key groove, and the hole is 1\" long, so that the lever arm can be [Pg 353]fixed on a stud socket like a wheel. By the aid of an adapter the lever arm is attached to a shaft. For the use of the handle see Figs. 30 and 101. There are however many other uses to which the lever arm is occasionally put. It can be used as a crank, and in linkage arrangements a pair of lever arms are very convenient. Studs A or C can replace the handle when necessary.\n\nSuch are the parts of the Willis apparatus which are adapted for our present purpose. It remains to add that the fits should be very easy, and the parts should be readily interchangeable.[Pg 354]\n\n[Pg 355]\n\nINDEX.\nA.\nAccident, risk of, 32\nAction, 6\nAdapter, Willis apparatus, 352\nAngle of friction, 78\nof statical friction, 80\nApparatus for centre of gravity, 62\nfor equilibrium of three forces, 7\nto show friction, 65, 78\nthe Willis, 345\nAppendix I., 339\nAtwood\u2019s machine, 232\nAxes, permanent, 279\nB.\nBalance, defective, 48\nspring, 16\nBar, equilibrium of a, 38\nBat, cricket, 309\nBeam, breadth of, 193\nbreaking load of, 193, 196\ncast iron, 222\ncollapse of, 186\ndeflection of, 179\nelasticity of, 184\nload on, 197\nplaced edgewise, 193\nstrained, 178\nstrength of, 190\nuniformly loaded, 198\nwith both ends secured, 200\nwith one end secured, 201\nBeds in Willis apparatus, 346\nBob, raising or lowering the, 320\nBolts, use of, in Willis apparatus, 346\nBracket, Willis apparatus, 350\nBrass, specific gravity of, 56\nBreaking load, 177\nBridge, deflection of, 208\nmechanics of, 218\nMenai, 218\nsuspension, 225\nthe Wye, 215\ntubular, 223\nwith four struts, 210\ntwo struts, 206\ntwo ties, 211\nBrunei, Sir J., the Wye bridge, 215\nC.\nCapstan, 151\nCast iron beam, 222\nCatenary, 226\nCathetometer, 180\nCentre of gravity, 57\nof a wheel, 61\nposition of, 59\noscillation, 304\npercussion, 307\nCircular motion, 267\naction of, 271\napplications of, 276\ncause of, 270\nin governor-balls, 276\nin sugar refining, 276\nnature of, 267\non liquids, 271\non the earth, 276\nCircular pendulum, 284\nClamps, 203\nClock pendulum, 299\nprinciples of, 318\nrate of, 322\nCoefficient of friction, 74, 82\nCollapse of a beam, 186[Pg 356]\nCompensating pendulum, 319\nComposition of forces, 1, 9\nparallel forces, 35, 37, 42\nvibrations, 299, 315\nConical pendulum, 310\nCouple, 44\nCrane, 29, 162\nfriction in, 166\nmechanical efficiency of, 165\nTable XXI. 165\nXXII. 166\nvelocity, ratio of, 163\nCricket bat, 309\nCrowbar, 123\nCycloid, 295\nD.\nDead-beat escapement, 328\nDefinition of force, 2\nDeflection of a beam, Table XXIII. 182\nDifferential pulley, 112\nTable XI. 114\nDirection of a force, 5\nE.\nEade, Mr., epicycloidal pulley-block, 116\nEaster Island, 100\nElasticity of beam, 184\nEnergy, 85, 94\nstorage of, 256, 258\nunit of, 95\nEngine, locomotive, 83\nEpicycloidal pulley-block, 80, 116\nTable XII. 118\nEquilibrium, neutral, 61\nof a bar, 38, 41\nthree forces, 6\ntwo forces, 6\nstable, 59\nunstable, 59\nEscapement, 324\ndead-beat, 328\nrecoil, 328\nExpansion of bodies, 321\nExperiment by M.

The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated. In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler. I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a \u201cstep-motherly\u201d fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought!\n\nDecember, 1916\n\nA. EINSTEIN\n\nPART I\nThe Special Theory of Relativity\n[Contents]\nI\nPhysical Meaning of Geometrical Propositions\nIn your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance with the noble building of Euclid\u2019s geometry, and you remember\u2014perhaps with more respect than love\u2014the magnificent structure, on the lofty staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours by conscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. But perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if some one were to ask you: \u201cWhat, then, do you mean by the assertion that these propositions are true?\u201d Let us proceed to give this question a little consideration.\n\nGeometry sets out form certain conceptions such as \u201cplane,\u201d \u201cpoint,\u201d and \u201cstraight line,\u201d with which we are able to associate more or less definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as \u201ctrue.\u201d Then, on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, i.e. they are proven. A proposition is then correct (\u201ctrue\u201d) when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms. The question of \u201ctruth\u201d of the individual geometrical propositions is thus reduced to one of the \u201ctruth\u201d of the axioms. Now it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals with things called \u201cstraight lines,\u201d to each of which is ascribed the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. The concept \u201ctrue\u201d does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry, because by the word \u201ctrue\u201d we are eventually in the habit of designating always the correspondence with a \u201creal\u201d object; geometry, however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves.\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel constrained to call the propositions of geometry \u201ctrue.\u201d Geometrical ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give to its structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for example, of seeing in a \u201cdistance\u201d two marked positions on a practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our place of observation.\n\nIf, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same distance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to which we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative position of practically rigid bodies.1 Geometry which has been supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics. We can now legitimately ask as to the \u201ctruth\u201d of geometrical propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can express this by saying that by the \u201ctruth\u201d of a geometrical proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with rule and compasses.\n\nOf course the conviction of the \u201ctruth\u201d of geometrical propositions in this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For the present we shall assume the \u201ctruth\u201d of the geometrical propositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory of relativity) we shall see that this \u201ctruth\u201d is limited, and we shall consider the extent of its limitation.\n\n1It follows that a natural object is associated also with a straight line. Three points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a straight line when the points A and C being given, B is chosen such that the sum of the distances AB and BC is as short as possible. This incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present purpose. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nII\nThe System of Co-ordinates\nOn the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been indicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between two points on a rigid body by means of measurements. For this purpose we require a \u201cdistance\u201d (rod S) which is to be used once and for all, and which we employ as a standard measure. If, now, A and B are two points on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them according to the rules of geometry; then, starting from A, we can mark off the distance S time after time until we reach B. The number of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance AB. This is the basis of all measurement of length.1\n\nEvery description of the scene of an event or of the position of an object in space is based on the specification of the point on a rigid body (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides. This applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday life. If I analyse the place specification \u201cTimes Square, New York,\u201d2 I arrive at the following result. The earth is the rigid body to which the specification of place refers; \u201cTimes Square, New York,\u201d is a well-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and with which the event coincides in space.3\n\nThis primitive method of place specification deals only with places on the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of points on this surface which are distinguishable from each other. But we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering the nature of our specification of position. If, for instance, a cloud is hovering over Times Square, then we can determine its position relative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined with the specification of the position of the foot of the pole, supplies us with a complete place specification. On the basis of this illustration, we are able to see the manner in which a refinement of the conception of position has been developed.\n\n(a)We imagine the rigid body, to which the place specification is referred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position we require is reached by the completed rigid body.\n(b)In locating the position of the object, we make use of a number (here the length of the pole measured with the measuring-rod) instead of designated points of reference.\nWe speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to reach the cloud.\n\nFrom this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the description of position, it should be possible by means of numerical measures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked positions (possessing names) on the rigid body of reference. In the physics of measurement this is attained by the application of the Cartesian system of co-ordinates.\n\nThis consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and rigidly attached to a rigid body. Referred to a system of co-ordinates, the scene of any event will be determined (for the main part) by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars or co-ordinates  which can be dropped from the scene of the event to those three plane surfaces. The lengths of these three perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with rigid measuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid down by Euclidean geometry.\n\nIn practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of co-ordinates are generally not available; furthermore, the magnitudes of the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with rigid rods, but by indirect means. If the results of physics and astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of specifications of position must always be sought in accordance with the above considerations.4\n\nWe thus obtain the following result: Every description of events in space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events have to be referred. The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws of Euclidean geometry hold for \u201cdistances;\u201d the \u201cdistance\u201d being represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a rigid body.\n\n1Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over i.e. that the measurement gives a whole number. This difficulty is got over by the use of divided measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not demand any fundamentally new method. \u2191\n\n2Einstein used \u201cPotsdamer Platz, Berlin\u201d in the original text. In the authorised translation this was supplemented with \u201cTrafalgar Square, London\u201d. We have changed this to \u201cTimes Square, New York\u201d, as this is the best known location to English speakers in the present day. \u2191\n\n3It is not necessary here to investigate further the significance of the expression \u201ccoincidence in space.\u201d This conception is sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice. \u2191\n\n4A refinement and modification of these views does not become necessary until we come to deal with the general theory of relativity, treated in the second part of this book. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nIII\nSpace and Time in Classical Mechanics\nThe purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their position in space with \u201ctime.\u201d I should load my conscience with grave sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.\n\nIt is not clear what is to be understood here by \u201cposition\u201d and \u201cspace.\u201d I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without throwing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes the misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a parabolic curve. I now ask: Do the \u201cpositions\u201d traversed by the stone lie \u201cin reality\u201d on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover, what is meant here by motion \u201cin space\u201d? From the considerations of the previous section the answer is self-evident. In the first place we entirely shun the vague word \u201cspace,\u201d of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we replace it by \u201cmotion relative to a practically rigid body of reference.\u201d The positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage or embankment) have already been defined in detail in the preceding section. If instead of \u201cbody of reference\u201d we insert \u201csystem of co-ordinates,\u201d which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we are in a position to say: The stone traverses a straight line relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, but relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the ground (embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid of this example it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an independently existing trajectory (lit. \u201cpath-curve\u201d1), but only a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference.\n\nIn order to have a complete description of the motion, we must specify how the body alters its position with time; i.e. for every point on the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is situated there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of time that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values can be regarded essentially as magnitudes (results of measurements) capable of observation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction; the man at the railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers determines the position on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick of the clock he is holding in his hand. In this connection we have not taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the velocity of propagation of light. With this and with a second difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later.\n\n1That is, a curve along which the body moves. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nIV\nThe Galileian System of Co-ordinates\nAs is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also indicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed stars do not move in a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which the state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it is called a \u201cGalileian system of co-ordinates.\u201d The laws of the mechanics of Galilei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system of co-ordinates.\n\n[Contents]\nV\nThe Principle of Relativity in the Restricted Sense\nIn order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to our example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation (\u201cuniform\u201d because it is of constant velocity and direction, \u201ctranslation\u201d because although the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment yet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us imagine a raven flying through the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that the motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and direction, but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line. Expressed in an abstract manner we may say: If a mass m is moving uniformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system K, then it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative to a second co-ordinate system K\u2032 provided that the latter is executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to K. In accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it follows that:\n\nIf K is a Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other co-ordinate system K\u2032 is a Galileian one, when, in relation to K, it is in a condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative to K\u2032 the mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as they do with respect to K.\n\nWe advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the tenet thus: If, relative to K, K\u2032 is a uniformly moving co-ordinate system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to K\u2032 according to exactly the same general laws as with respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense).\n\nAs long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable of representation with the help of classical mechanics, there was no need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural phenomena. At this juncture the question of the validity of the principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the negative.\n\nNevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity. Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical phenomena, still we must grant it a considerable measure of \u201ctruth,\u201d since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of mechanics. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be invalid for another, is a priori not very probable.\n\nWe now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall return later. If the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense) does not hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems K, K\u2032, K\u2033, etc., which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will not be equivalent for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we should be constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of being formulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only on condition that, from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate systems, we should have chosen one () of a particular state of motion as our body of reference. We should then be justified (because of its merits for the description of natural phenomena) in calling this system \u201cabsolutely at rest,\u201d and all other Galileian systems K \u201cin motion.\u201d If, for instance, our embankment were the system  then our railway carriage would be a system K, relative to which less simple laws would hold than with respect to . This diminished simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K would be in motion (i.e. \u201creally\u201d) with respect to . In the general laws of nature which have been formulated with reference to K, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a part. We should expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were placed perpendicular to this direction.\n\nNow in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in space with respect to the earth. For owing to the alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in the course of a year, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system  throughout the whole year. However, the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This is very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity.\n\n[Contents]\nVI\nThe Theorem of the Addition of Velocities Employed in Classical Mechanics\nLet us suppose our old friend the railway carriage to be travelling along the rails with a constant velocity v, and that a man traverses the length of the carriage in the direction of travel with a velocity w. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity W does the man advance relative to the embankment during the process? The only possible answer seems to result from the following consideration: If the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to the embankment through a distance v equal numerically to the velocity of the carriage. As a consequence of his walking, however, he traverses an additional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence also relative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w being numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. Thus in total he covers the distance  relative to the embankment in the second considered. We shall see later that this result, which expresses the theorem of the addition of velocities employed in classical mechanics, cannot be maintained; in other words, the law that we have just written down does not hold in reality. For the time being, however, we shall assume its correctness.\n\n[Contents]\nVII\nThe Apparent Incompatibility of the Law of Propagation of Light with the Principle of Relativity\nThere is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows, or believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines with a velocity  km./sec. At all events we know with great exactness that this velocity is the same for all colours, because if this were not the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed star by its dark neighbour. By means of similar considerations based on observations of double stars, the Dutch astronomer De Sitter was also able to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot depend on the velocity of motion of the body emitting the light. The assumption that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the direction \u201cin space\u201d is in itself improbable.\n\nIn short, let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the velocity of light c (in vacuum) is justifiably believed by the child at school. Who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual difficulties? Let us consider how these difficulties arise.\n\nOf course we must refer the process of the propagation of light (and indeed every other process) to a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate system). As such a system let us again choose our embankment. We shall imagine the air above it to have been removed. If a ray of light be sent along the embankment, we see from the above that the tip of the ray will be transmitted with the velocity c relative to the embankment. Now let us suppose that our railway carriage is again travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v, and that its direction is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propagation of the ray of light relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can here apply the consideration of the previous section, since the ray of light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the carriage. The velocity W of the man relative to the embankment is here replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have\n\n\nThe velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative to the carriage thus comes out smaller than c.\n\nBut this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity set forth in Section V. For, like every other general law of nature, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo [in vacuum] must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the railway carriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of reference. But, from our above consideration, this would appear to be impossible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would appear that another law of propagation of light must necessarily hold with respect to the carriage\u2014a result contradictory to the principle of relativity.\n\nIn view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple law of the propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you who have carefully followed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so convincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. The law of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be replaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however, that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were therefore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of the fact that no empirical data had been found which were contradictory to this principle.\n\nAt this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space, it became evident that in reality there is not the least incompatibility between the principle of relativity and the law of propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to both these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it from the extended theory, with which we shall deal later. In the following pages we shall present the fundamental ideas of the special theory of relativity.\n\n[Contents]\nVIII\nOn the Idea of Time in Physics\nLightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places A and B far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask you whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my question with a decided \u201cYes.\u201d But if I now approach you with the request to explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you find after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so easy as it appears at first sight.\n\nAfter some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you: \u201cThe significance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further explanation; of course it would require some consideration if I were to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual case the two events took place simultaneously or not.\u201d I cannot be satisfied with this answer for the following reason. Supposing that as a result of ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to discover that the lightning must always strike the places A and B simultaneously, then we should be faced with the task of testing whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance with the reality. We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements in which the conception \u201csimultaneous\u201d plays a part. The concept does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning strokes occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is not satisfied, I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and of course the same applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine that I am able to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on this point.)\n\nAfter thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the following suggestion with which to test simultaneity. By measuring along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measured up and an observer placed at the mid-point M of the distance AB. This observer should be supplied with an arrangement (e.g. two mirrors inclined at ) which allows him visually to observe both places A and B at the same time. If the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at the same time, then they are simultaneous.\n\nI am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to raise the following objection:\n\n\u201cYour definition would certainly be right, if only I knew that the light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning flashes travels along the length  with the same velocity as along the length . But an examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle.\u201d\n\nAfter further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at me\u2014and rightly so\u2014and you declare:\n\n\u201cI maintain my previous definition nevertheless, because in reality it assumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only one demand to be made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that in every real case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether or not the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. That my definition satisfies this demand is indisputable. That light requires the same time to traverse the path  as for the path  is in reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own freewill in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that this definition can be used to give an exact meaning not only to two events, but to as many events as we care to choose, and independently of the positions of the scenes of the events with respect to the body of reference1 (here the railway embankment). We are thus led also to a definition of \u201ctime\u201d in physics. For this purpose we suppose that clocks of identical construction are placed at the points A, B, and C of the railway line (co-ordinate system) and that they are set in such a manner that the positions of their pointers are simultaneously (in the above sense) the same. Under these conditions we understand by the \u201ctime\u201d of an event the reading (position of the hands) of that one of these clocks which is in the immediate vicinity (in space) of the event. In this manner a time-value is associated with every event which is essentially capable of observation.\n\nThis stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validity of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the contrary. It has been assumed that all these clocks go at the same rate if they are of identical construction. Stated more exactly: When two clocks arranged at rest in different places of a reference-body are set in such a manner that a particular position of the pointers of the one clock is simultaneous (in the above sense) with the same position, of the pointers of the other clock, then identical \u201csettings\u201d are always simultaneous (in the sense of the above definition).\n\n1We suppose further, that, when three events A, B, and C occur in different places in such a manner that A is simultaneous with B, and B is simultaneous with C (simultaneous in the sense of the above definition), then the criterion for the simultaneity of the pair of events  is also satisfied. This assumption is a physical hypothesis about the the of propagation of light: it must certainly be fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nIX\nThe Relativity of Simultaneity\nUp to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body of reference, which we have styled a \u201crailway embankment.\u201d We suppose a very long train travelling along the rails with the constant velocity v and in the direction indicated in Fig. 1. People travelling in this train will with a vantage view the train as a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate system); they regard all events in reference to the train. Then every event which takes place along the line also takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the train in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a natural consequence, however, the following question arises:\n\nFig. 1.\nFig. 1.\n\n\nAre two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B) which are simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also simultaneous relatively to the train? We shall show directly that the answer must be in the negative.\n\nWhen we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at the places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the mid-point M of the length  of the embankment. But the events A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M\u2032 be the mid-point of the distance  on the travelling train. Just when the flashes1 of lightning occur, this point M\u2032 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If an observer sitting in the position M\u2032 in the train did not possess this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M, and the light rays emitted by the flashes of lightning A and B would reach him simultaneously, i.e. they would meet just where he is situated. Now in reality (considered with reference to the railway embankment) he is hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A. We thus arrive at the important result:\n\nEvents which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not simultaneous with respect to the train, and vice versa (relativity of simultaneity). Every reference-body (co-ordinate system) has its own particular time; unless we are told the reference-body to which the statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event.\n\nNow before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an absolute significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state of motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between the law of the propagation of light in vacuo and the principle of relativity (developed in Section VII) disappears.\n\nWe were led to that conflict by the considerations of Section VI, which are now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the man in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per second relative to the carriage, traverses the same distance also with respect to the embankment in each second of time. But, according to the foregoing considerations, the time required by a particular occurrence with respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as reference-body). Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is equal to one second as judged from the embankment.\n\nMoreover, the considerations of Section VI are based on yet a second assumption, which, in the light of a strict consideration, appears to be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made even before the introduction of the theory of relativity.\n\n1As judged from the embankment. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nX\nOn the Relativity of the Conception of Distance\nLet us consider two particular points on the train1 travelling along the embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to their distance apart. We already know that it is necessary to have a body of reference for the measurement of a distance, with respect to which body the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use the train itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight line (e.g. along the floor of the carriage) as many times as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other. Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance.\n\nIt is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the railway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call A\u2032 and B\u2032 the two points on the train whose distance apart is required, then both of these points are moving with the velocity v along the embankment. In the first place we require to determine the points A and B of the embankment which are just being passed by the two points A\u2032 and B\u2032 at a particular time t\u2014judged from the embankment. These points A and B of the embankment can be determined by applying the definition of time given in Section VIII. The distance between these points A and B is then measured by repeated application of the measuring-rod along the embankment.\n\nA priori it is by no means certain that this last measurement will supply us with the same result as the first. Thus the length of the train as measured from the embankment may be different from that obtained by measuring in the train itself. This circumstance leads us to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently obvious consideration of Section VI. Namely, if the man in the carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time\u2014measured from the train,\u2014then this distance\u2014as measured from the embankment\u2014is not necessarily also equal to w.\n\n1e.g. the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXI\nThe Lorentz Transformation\nThe results of the last three sections show that the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity (Section VII) has been derived by means of a consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics; these are as follows:\n\n(1)The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.\n(2)The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid body is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.\n\nIf we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section VII disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived in Section VI becomes invalid. The possibility presents itself that the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be compatible with the principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to modify the considerations of Section VI in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of experience? This question leads to a general one. In the discussion of Section VI we have to do with places and times relative both to the train and to the embankment. How are we to find the place and time of an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of the event with respect to the railway embankment? Is there a thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle of relativity? In other words: Can we conceive of a relation between place and time of the individual events relative to both reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a perfectly definite transformation law for the space-time magnitudes of an event when changing over from one body of reference to another.\n\nFig. 2.\nFig. 2.\n\n\nBefore we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section II we can imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a vertical direction by means of a framework of rods, so that an event which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework. Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so that every event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with respect to the second framework. Without committing any fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would continually interfere with each other, owing to the impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated as \u201cco-ordinate planes\u201d (\u201cco-ordinate system\u201d). A co-ordinate system K then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system K\u2032 to the train. An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be fixed in space with respect to K by the three perpendiculars  on the co-ordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value t. Relative to K\u2032, the same event would be fixed in respect of space and time by corresponding values , which of course are not identical with . It has already been set forth in detail how these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical measurements.\n\nObviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following manner. What are the values , of an event with respect to K\u2032, when the magnitudes , of the same event with respect to K are given? The relations must be so chosen that the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and K\u2032. For the relative orientation in space of the co-ordinate systems indicated in the diagram (Fig 2), this problem is solved by means of the equations:\n\nThis system of equations is known as the \u201cLorentz transformation.\u201d1\n\nIf in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our basis the tacit assumptions of the older mechanics as to the absolute character of times and lengths, then instead of the above we should have obtained the following equations:\n\nThis system of equations is often termed the \u201cGalilei transformation.\u201d The Galilei transformation can be obtained from the Lorentz transformation by substituting an infinitely large value for the velocity of light c in the latter transformation.\n\nAided by the following illustration, we can readily see that, in accordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied both for the reference-body K and for the reference-body K\u2032. A light-signal is sent along the positive x-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in accordance with the equation\n\ni.e. with the velocity c. According to the equations of the Lorentz transformation, this simple relation between x and t involves a relation between x\u2032 and t\u2032. In point of fact, if we substitute for x the value ct in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation, we obtain:\n\nfrom which, by division, the expression\n\nimmediately follows. If referred to the system K\u2032, the propagation of light takes place according to this equation. We thus see that the velocity of transmission relative to the reference-body K\u2032 is also equal to c. The same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in any other direction whatsoever. Of course this is not surprising, since the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this point of view.\n\n1A simple derivation of the Lorentz transformation is given in Appendix I. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXII\nThe Behaviour of Measuring-Rods and Clocks in Motion\nPlace a metre-rod in the x\u2032-axis of K\u2032 in such a manner that one end (the beginning) coincides with the point  whilst the other end (the end of the rod) coincides with the point . What is the length of the metre-rod relatively to the system K? In order to learn this, we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the rod lie with respect to K at a particular time t of the system K. By means of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of these two points at the time  can be shown to be\n\nthe distance between the points being .\n\nBut the metre-rod is moving with the velocity v relative to K. It therefore follows that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity v is  of a metre. The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For the velocity  we should have , and for still greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary. From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity c plays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body.\n\nOf course this feature of the velocity c as a limiting velocity also clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for these became meaningless if we choose values of v greater than c.\n\nIf, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the x-axis with respect to K, then we should have found that the length of the rod as judged from K\u2032 would have been ; this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which forms the basis of our considerations.\n\nA Priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes , are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerations on the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion.\n\nLet us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently situated at the origin () of K\u2032.  and  are two successive ticks of this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks:\n\nand\n\n\nAs judged from K, the clock is moving with the velocity v; as judged from this reference-body, the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not one second, but  seconds, i.e. a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity c plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.\n\n[Contents]\nXIII\nTheorem of the Addition of Velocities.\nThe Experiment of Fizeau\nNow in practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light; hence we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section directly with the reality. But, on the other hand, these results must strike you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now draw another conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most elegantly confirmed by experiment.\n\nIn Section VI we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in one direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of classical mechanics. This theorem can also be deduced readily from the Galilei transformation (Section XI). In place of the man walking inside the carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively to the co-ordinate system K\u2032 in accordance with the equation\n\n\nBy means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei transformation we can express x\u2032 and t\u2032 in terms of x and t, and we then obtain\n\n\nThis equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the point with reference to the system K (of the man with reference to the embankment). We denote this velocity by the symbol W, and we then obtain, as in Section VI,\n\t(A)\n\nBut we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of the theory of relativity. In the equation\n\nwe must then express x\u2032 and t\u2032 in terms of x and t, making use of the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation. Instead of the equation (A) we then obtain the equation\n\t(B)\nwhich corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one direction according to the theory of relativity. The question now arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with experience. On this point we are enlightened by a most important experiment which the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than half a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about its result. The experiment is concerned with the following question. Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w. How quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T (see the accompanying diagram, Figure 3) when the liquid above mentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v?\n\nFig. 3\nFig. 3\n\n\nIn accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place with the same velocity w with respect to the liquid, whether the latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. The velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative to the tube are thus known, and we require the velocity of light relative to the tube.\n\nIt is clear that we have the problem of Section VI again before us. The tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the co-ordinate system K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the co-ordinate system K\u2032, and finally, the light plays the part of the man walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the present section. If we denote the velocity of the light relative to the tube by W, then this is given by the equation (A) or (B), according as the Galilei transformation or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to the facts. Experiment1 decides in favour of equation (B) derived from the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very exact. According to recent and most excellent measurements by Zeeman, the influence of the velocity of flow v on the propagation of light is represented by formula (B) to within one per cent.\n\nNevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of this phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement of the theory of relativity. This theory was of a purely electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the use of particular hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on which the original theory was based, in no way opposes the theory of relativity. Rather has the latter been developed from electrodynamics as an astoundingly simple combination and generalisation of the hypotheses, formerly independent of each other, on which electrodynamics was built.\n\n1Fizeau found , where  is the index of refraction of the liquid. On the other hand, owing to the smallness of  as compared with 1, we can replace (B) in the first place by , or to the same order of approximation by , which agrees with Fizeau\u2019s result. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXIV\nThe Heuristic Value of the Theory of Relativity\nOur train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the following manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates we obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates  and the time t of the events which constitute the processes of nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei transformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is justified by our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of thought. Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the theory thus:\n\nEvery general law of nature must be so constituted that it is transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the space-time variables  of the original coordinate system K, we introduce new space-time variables  of a co-ordinate system K\u2032. In this connection the relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in brief: General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.\n\nThis is a definite mathematical condition that the theory of relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general laws of nature. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now examine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced.\n\n[Contents]\nXV\nGeneral Results of the Theory\nIt is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure, i.e. the derivation of laws, and\u2014what is incomparably more important\u2014it has considerably reduced the number of independent hypotheses forming the basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less unequivocally in its favour.\n\nClassical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the main part, however, this modification affects only the laws for rapid motions, in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as compared with the velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make themselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a material point of mass m is no longer given by the well-known expression\n\nbut by the expression\n\n\nThis expression approaches infinity as the velocity v approaches the velocity of light c. The velocity must therefore always remain less than c, however great may be the energies used to produce the acceleration. If we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in the form of a series, we obtain\n\n\nWhen  is small compared with unity, the third of these terms is always small in comparison with the second, which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The first term  does not contain the velocity, and requires no consideration if we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a point-mass depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential significance later.\n\nThe most important result of a general character to which the special theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass. Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the conservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass; these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now briefly consider how this unification came about, and what meaning is to be attached to it.\n\nThe principle of relativity requires that the law of the conservation of energy should hold not only with reference to a co-ordinate system K, but also with respect to every co-ordinate system K\u2032 which is in a state of uniform motion of translation relative to K, or, briefly, relative to every \u201cGalileian\u201d system of co-ordinates. In contrast to classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation is the deciding factor in the transition from one such system to another.\n\nBy means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving with the velocity v, which absorbs1 an amount of energy  in the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in the process, has, as a consequence, its energy increased by an amount\n\n\nIn consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy of the body, the required energy of the body comes out to be\n\nThus the body has the same energy as a body of mass  moving with the velocity v. Hence we can say: If a body takes up an amount of energy , then its inertial mass increases by an amount ; the inertial mass of a body is not a constant but varies according to the change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the conservation of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of the conservation of energy, and is only valid provided that the system neither takes up nor sends out energy. Writing the expression for the energy in the form\n\nwe see that the term , which has hitherto attracted our attention, is nothing else than the energy possessed by the body2 before it absorbed the energy .\n\nA direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at the present time (1920; see3 Note, p. 48), owing to the fact that the changes in energy  to which we can subject a system are not large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass of the system.  is too small in comparison with the mass m, which was present before the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that classical mechanics was able to establish successfully the conservation of mass as a law of independent validity.\n\nLet me add a final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of Newton\u2019s law of gravitation. According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c plays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in what way this result becomes modified in the general theory of relativity.\n\n1 is the energy taken up, as judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body. \u2191\n\n2As judged from a co-ordinate system moving with the body. \u2191\n\n3The equation  has been thoroughly proved time and again since this time. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXVI\nExperience and the Special Theory of Relativity\nTo what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by experience? This question is not easily answered for the reason already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of Fizeau. The special theory of relativity has crystallised out from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of experience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the theory of relativity. As being of particular importance, I mention here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the effects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars. These results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects indicated, which are due to the relative motion of the earth with reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with experience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the earth round the sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial components of the relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the colour of the light reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the position of the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source of light (Doppler principle). The experimental arguments in favour of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in favour of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an extent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been able to hold its own when tested by experience.\n\nBut there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained which can be represented in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself\u2014i.e. without making use of the theory of relativity\u2014appears extraneous.\n\nIt is known that cathode rays and the so-called -rays emitted by radioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles (electrons) of very small inertia and large velocity. By examining the deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic fields, we can study the law of motion of these particles very exactly.\n\nIn the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an account of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign repel each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.1 If we now assume that the relative distances between the electrical masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of the electron (rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was the first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of that motion. The contracted length being proportional to the expression  This hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical facts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion which has been confirmed with great precision in recent years.\n\nThe theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion, without requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and the behaviour of the electron. We arrived at a similar conclusion in Section XIII in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result of which is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the liquid.\n\nThe second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to the question whether or not the motion of the earth in space can be made perceptible in terrestrial experiments. We have already remarked in Section V that all attempts of this nature led to a negative result. Before the theory of relativity was put forward, it was difficult to become reconciled to this negative result, for reasons now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about time and space did not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the Galileian transformation for changing over from one body of reference to another. Now assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a reference-body K, we then find that they do not hold for a reference-body K\u2032 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume that the relations of the Galileian transformation exist between the co-ordinates of K and K\u2032. It thus appears that, of all Galileian co-ordinate systems, one (K) corresponding to a particular state of motion is physically unique. This result was interpreted physically by regarding K as at rest with respect to a hypothetical \u00e6ther of space. On the other hand, all coordinate systems K\u2032 moving relatively to K were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the \u00e6ther. To this motion of K\u2032 against the \u00e6ther (\u201c\u00e6ther-drift\u201d relative to K\u2032) were attributed the more complicated laws which were supposed to hold relative to K\u2032. Strictly speaking, such an \u00e6ther-drift ought also to be assumed relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an \u00e6ther-drift at the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nIn one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a method which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to pass from one mirror to the other and back again, if the whole system be at rest with respect to the \u00e6ther. It is found by calculation, however, that a slightly different time T\u2032 is required for this process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively to the \u00e6ther. And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that for a given velocity v with reference to the \u00e6ther, this time T\u2032 is different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the mirrors from that resulting when the motion is parallel to these planes. Although the estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result\u2014a fact very perplexing to physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the \u00e6ther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the difference in time mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in Section XII shows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty was the right one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According to this theory there is no such thing as a \u201cspecially favoured\u201d (unique) co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the \u00e6ther-idea, and hence there can be no \u00e6ther-drift, nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the introduction of particular hypotheses; and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun.\n\n1The general theory of relativity renders it likely that the electrical masses of an electron are held together by gravitational forces. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXVII\nMinkowski\u2019s Four-Dimensional Space\nThe non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when he hears of \u201cfour-dimensional\u201d things, by a feeling not unlike that awakened by thoughts of the occult. And yet there is no more common-place statement than that the world in which we live is a four-dimensional space-time continuum.\n\nSpace is a three-dimensional continuum. By this we mean that it is possible to describe the position of a point (at rest) by means of three numbers (co-ordinates) , and that there is an indefinite number of points in the neighbourhood of this one, the position of which can be described by co-ordinates such as , which may be as near as we choose to the respective values of the co-ordinates , of the first point. In virtue of the latter property we speak of a \u201ccontinuum,\u201d and owing to the fact that there are three co-ordinates we speak of it as being \u201cthree-dimensional.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called \u201cworld\u201d by Minkowski is naturally four-dimensional in the space-time sense. For it is composed of individual events, each of which is described by four numbers, namely, three space co-ordinates , and a time co-ordinate, the time value t. The \u201cworld\u201d is in this sense also a continuum; for to every event there are as many \u201cneighbouring\u201d events (realised or at least thinkable) as we care to choose, the co-ordinates  of which differ by an indefinitely small amount from those of the event  originally considered. That we have not been accustomed to regard the world in this sense as a four-dimensional continuum is due to the fact that in physics, before the advent of the theory of relativity, time played a different and more independent role, as compared with the space coordinates. It is for this reason that we have been in the habit of treating time as an independent continuum. As a matter of fact, according to classical mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. it is independent of the position and the condition of motion of the system of co-ordinates. We see this expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation ()\n\nThe four-dimensional mode of consideration of the \u201cworld\u201d is natural on the theory of relativity, since according to this theory time is robbed of its independence. This is shown by the fourth equation of the Lorentz transformation:\n\n\nMoreover, according to this equation the time difference  of two events with respect to K\u2032 does not in general vanish, even when the time difference  of the same events with reference to K vanishes. Pure \u201cspace-distance\u201d of two events with respect to K results in \u201ctime-distance\u201d of the same events with respect to K\u2032. But the discovery of Minkowski, which was of importance for the formal development of the theory of relativity, does not lie here. It is to be found rather in the fact of his recognition that the four-dimensional space-time continuum of the theory of relativity, in its most essential formal properties, shows a pronounced relationship to the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical space.1 In order to give due prominence to this relationship, however, we must replace the usual time co-ordinate t by an imaginary magnitude  proportional to it. Under these conditions, the natural laws satisfying the demands of the (special) theory of relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the time co-ordinate plays exactly the same role as the three space co-ordinates. Formally, these four co-ordinates correspond exactly to the three space co-ordinates in Euclidean geometry. It must be clear even to the non-mathematician that, as a consequence of this purely formal addition to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no mean measure.\n\nThese inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague notion of the important idea contributed by Minkowski. Without it the general theory of relativity, of which the fundamental ideas are developed in the following pages, would perhaps have got no farther than its long clothes. Minkowski\u2019s work is doubtless difficult of access to anyone inexperienced in mathematics, but since it is not necessary to have a very exact grasp of this work in order to understand the fundamental ideas of either the special or the general theory of relativity, I shall leave it here at present, and revert to it only towards the end of Part II.\n\n1Cf. the somewhat more detailed discussion in Appendix II. \u2191\n\nPART II\nThe General Theory of Relativity\n[Contents]\nXVIII\nSpecial and General Principle of Relativity\nThe basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous considerations, was the special principle of relativity, i.e. the principle of the physical relativity of all uniform motion. Let as once more analyse its meaning carefully.\n\nIt was at all times clear that, from the point of view of the idea it conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative motion. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are equally justifiable:\n\n(a)The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment,\n(b)The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.\n\nIn (a) the embankment, in (b) the carriage, serves as the body of reference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is simply a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in principle immaterial to what reference-body we refer the motion. As already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused with the much more comprehensive statement called \u201cthe principle of relativity,\u201d which we have taken as the basis of our investigations.\n\nThe principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our reference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is self-evident). Our principle rather asserts what follows: If we formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from experience, by making use of\n\n(a)the embankment as reference-body,\n(b)the railway carriage as reference-body,\nthen these general laws of nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or the law of the propagation of light in vacuo) have exactly the same form in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows: For the physical description of natural processes, neither of the reference bodies K, K\u2032 is unique (lit. \u201cspecially marked out\u201d) as compared with the other. Unlike the first, this latter statement need not of necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the conceptions of \u201cmotion\u201d and \u201creference-body\u201d and derivable from them; only experience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness.\n\nUp to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection with the formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following lines. In the first place, we started out from the assumption that there exists a reference-body K, whose condition of motion is such that the Galileian law holds with respect to it: A particle left to itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible. But in addition to K, all bodies of reference K\u2032 should be given preference in this sense, and they should be exactly equivalent to K for the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state of uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion with respect to K; all these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian reference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was assumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for others (e.g. those possessing motion of a different kind). In this sense we speak of the special principle of relativity, or special theory of relativity.\n\nIn contrast to this we wish to understand by the \u201cgeneral principle of relativity\u201d the following statement: All bodies of reference K, K\u2032, etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their state of motion. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract one, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage.\n\nSince the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle of relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate, there is little hope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ourselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving uniformly, the occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for this reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in motion. Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity, this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of view.\n\nIf the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage. The mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously considered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relativity. But in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained.\n\n[Contents]\nXIX\nThe Gravitational Field\n\u201cIf we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the ground?\u201d The usual answer to this question is: \u201cBecause it is attracted by the earth.\u201d Modern physics formulates the answer rather differently for the following reason. As a result of the more careful study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some intermediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we are constrained to imagine\u2014after the manner of Faraday\u2014that the magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space around it, that something being what we call a \u201cmagnetic field.\u201d In its turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the latter strives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss here the justification for this incidental conception, which is indeed a somewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the transmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also are regarded in an analogous manner.\n\nThe action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The earth produces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the stone and produces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the intensity of the action on a body diminishes according to a quite definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth. From our point of view this means: The law governing the properties of the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one, in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action with the distance from operative bodies. It is something like this: The body (e.g. the earth) produces a field in its immediate neighbourhood directly; the intensity and direction of the field at points farther removed from the body are thence determined by the law which governs the properties in space of the gravitational fields themselves.\n\nIn contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving under the sole influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, which does not in the least depend either on the material or on the physical state of the body. For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (in vacuo), when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity. This law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in the light of the following consideration.\n\nAccording to Newton\u2019s law of motion, we have\n\n(Force) = (inertial mass)  (acceleration),\n\nwhere the \u201cinertial mass\u201d is a characteristic constant of the accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration, we then have\n\n(Force) = (gravitational mass)  (intensity of the gravitational field),\n\nwhere the \u201cgravitational mass\u201d is likewise a characteristic constant for the body. From these two relations follows:\n\n\nIf now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be independent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all bodies. By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio equal to unity. We then have the following law: The gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial mass.\n\nIt is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in mechanics, but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact: The same quality of a body manifests itself according to circumstances as \u201cinertia\u201d or as \u201cweight\u201d (lit. \u201cheaviness\u201d). In the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually the case, and how this question is connected with the general postulate of relativity.\n\n[Contents]\nXX\nThe Equality of Inertial and Gravitational Mass as an Argument for the General Postulate of Relativity\nWe imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars and other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It is then possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space (world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As reference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.\n\nTo the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with rope attached, and now a \u201cbeing\u201d (what kind of a being is immaterial to us) begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest together with the observer then begin to move \u201cupwards\u201d with a uniformly accelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will reach unheard-of values\u2014provided that we are viewing all this from another reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope.\n\nBut how does the man in the chest regard the process? The acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction of the floor of the chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full length on the floor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of a home on our earth. If he releases a body which he previously had in his hand, the acceleration of the chest will no longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative motion. The observer will further convince himself that the acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the experiment.\n\nRelying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will thus come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational field which is constant with regard to time. Of course he will be puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this gravitational field. Just then, however, he discovers the hook in the middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it, and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is suspended at rest in the gravitational field.\n\nOught we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion? I do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent; we must rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated with respect to the \u201cGalileian space\u201d first considered, we can nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity.\n\nWe must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational field of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what comes to the same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. If this natural law did not exist, the man in the accelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the bodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he would not be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his reference-body to be \u201cat rest.\u201d\n\nSuppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The result of this will be to stretch the rope so that it will hang \u201cvertically\u201d downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: \u201cThe suspended body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is neutralised by the tension of the rope; what determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the suspended body.\u201d On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely in space will interpret the condition of things thus: \u201cThe rope must perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this motion to the body attached to it. The tension of the rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the inertial mass of the body.\u201d Guided by this example, we see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of this law.\n\nFrom our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations. A gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the fact that there was no such field for the co-ordinate system first chosen. Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a gravitational field is always only an apparent one. We might also think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no gravitational field exists with reference to it. This is by no means true for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special form. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference such that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in its entirety) vanishes.\n\nWe can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we brought forward against the general principle of relativity at the end of Section XVIII. It is certainly true that the observer in the railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the application of the brake, and that he recognises, in this the non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. But he is compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a \u201creal \u201cacceleration (retardation) of the carriage. He might also interpret his experience thus: \u201cMy body of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at rest. With reference to it, however, there exists (during the period of application of the brakes) a gravitational field which is directed forwards and which is variable with respect to time. Under the influence of this field, the embankment together with the earth moves non-uniformly in such a manner that their original velocity in the backwards direction is continuously reduced.\u201d\n\n[Contents]\nXXI\nIn What Respects Are the Foundations of Classical Mechanics and of the Special Theory of Relativity Unsatisfactory?\nWe have already stated several times that classical mechanics starts out from the following law: Material particles sufficiently far removed from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a straight line or continue in a state of rest. We have also repeatedly emphasised that this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of reference K which possess certain unique states of motion, and which are in uniform translational motion relative to each other. Relative to other reference-bodies K the law is not valid. Both in classical mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we therefore differentiate between reference-bodies K relative to which the recognised \u201claws of nature\u201d can be said to hold, and reference-bodies K relative to which these laws do not hold.\n\nBut no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with this condition of things. He asks: \u201cHow does it come that certain reference-bodies (or their states of motion) are given priority over other reference-bodies (or their states of motion)? What is the reason for this preference?\u201d In order to show clearly what I mean by this question, I shall make use of a comparison.\n\nI am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of each other on the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken for the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is being emitted continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I am surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or a pan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish colour under the first pan but not under the other, I cease to be astonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of the steam, or at least possibly it may do so. If, however, I notice the bluish something in neither case, and if I observe that the one continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some circumstance to which I can attribute the different behaviour of the two pans.\n\nAnalogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical mechanics (or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to the reference systems K and K.1 Newton saw this objection and attempted to invalidate it, but without success. But E. Mach recognised it most clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that mechanics must be placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by means of a physics which is conformable to the general principle of relativity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every body of reference, whatever may be its state of motion.\n\n1The objection is of importance more especially when the state of motion of the reference-body is of such a nature that it does not require any external agency for its maintenance, e.g. in the case when the reference-body is rotating uniformly. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXXII\nA Few Inferences from the General Principle of Relativity\nThe considerations of Section XX show that the general principle of relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, for instance, that we know the space-time \u201ccourse\u201d for any natural process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in the Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference K. By means of purely theoretical operations (i.e. simply by calculation) we are then able to find how this known natural process appears, as seen from a reference-body K\u2032 which is accelerated relatively to K. But since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of reference K, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational field influences the process studied.\n\nFor example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform rectilinear motion with respect to K (in accordance with the law of Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion with respect to the accelerated reference-body K\u2032 (chest). This acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to K. It is known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in this way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing essentially new.\n\nHowever, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we carry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light. With respect to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily be shown that the path of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body K\u2032). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects this result is of great importance.\n\nIn the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light rays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest itself in the following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent position in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the heavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to be expected of astronomers.1\n\nIn the second place our result shows that, according to the general theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light varies with position. Now we might think that as a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust. But in reality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the special theory of relativity cannot claim an unlimited domain of validity; its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena (e.g. of light).\n\nSince it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the general theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make the facts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison. Before the development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics were looked upon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we know that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic considerations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each other, and to the co-ordinate system. Should we be justified in saying that for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the field-equations of Maxwell in electrodynamics? Not in the least. Electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case; the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the case in which the fields are invariable with regard to time. No fairer destiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should of itself point out the way to the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case.\n\nIn the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of natural processes, the laws of which are already known when a gravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key, concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational field itself. Let us consider this for a moment.\n\nWe are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately) in a \u201cGalileian\u201d fashion under suitable choice of reference-body, i.e. domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If we now refer such a domain to a reference-body K\u2032 possessing any kind of motion, then relative to K\u2032 there exists a gravitational field which is variable with respect to space and time.2 The character of this field will of course depend on the motion chosen for K\u2032. According to the general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitational field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in this way. Even though by no means all gravitational fields can be produced in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general law of gravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of a special kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, and as this lies deep at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the reader. We require to extend our ideas of the space-time continuum still farther.\n\n1By means of the star photographs of two expeditions equipped by a Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the existence of the deflection of light demanded by theory was first confirmed during the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. (Cf. Appendix III.) \u2191\n\n2This follows from a generalisation of the discussion in Section XX. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXXIII\nBehaviour of Clocks and Measuring-Rods on a Rotating Body of Reference\nHitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical interpretation of space- and time-data in the case of the general theory of relativity. As a consequence, I am guilty of a certain slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory of relativity, is far from being unimportant and pardonable. It is now high time that we remedy this defect; but I would mention at the outset, that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on the power of abstraction of the reader.\n\nWe start off again from quite special cases, which we have frequently used before. Let us consider a space-time domain in which no gravitational field exists relative to a reference-body K whose state of motion has been suitably chosen. K is then a Galileian reference-body as regards the domain considered, and the results of the special theory of relativity hold relative to K. Let us suppose the same domain referred to a second body of reference K\u2032, which is rotating uniformly with respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we shall imagine K\u2032 to be in the form of a plane circular disc, which rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who is sitting eccentrically on the disc K\u2032 is sensible of a force which acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as an effect of inertia (centrifugal force) by an observer who was at rest with respect to the original reference-body K. But the observer on the disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is \u201cat rest\u201d; on the basis of the general principle of relativity he is justified in doing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on all other bodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as the effect of a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the space-distribution of this gravitational field is of a kind that would not be possible on Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation.1 But since the observer believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not disturb him; he is quite in the right when he believes that a general law of gravitation can be formulated\u2014a law which not only explains the motion of the stars correctly, but also the field of force experienced by himself.\n\nThe observer performs experiments on his circular disc with clocks and measuring-rods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact definitions for the signification of time- and space-data with reference to the circular disc K\u2032, these definitions being based on his observations. What will be his experience in this enterprise?\n\nTo start with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We now ask ourselves whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the non-rotating Galileian reference-body K. As judged from this body, the clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at the edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the rotation. According to a result obtained in Section XII, it follows that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of the clock at the centre of the circular disc, i.e. as observed from K. It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer whom we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated (at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest with respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty presents itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity in such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this question.\n\nMoreover, at this stage the definition of the space co-ordinates also presents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies his standard measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compared with the radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as judged from the Galileian system, the length of this rod will be less than 1, since, according to Section XII, moving bodies suffer a shortening in the direction of the motion. On the other hand, the measuring-rod will not experience a shortening in length, as judged from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius. If, then, the observer first measures the circumference of the disc with his measuring-rod and then the diameter of the disc, on dividing the one by the other, he will not obtain as quotient the familiar number , but a larger number,2 whereas of course, for a disc which is at rest with respect to K, this operation would yield  exactly. This proves that the propositions of Euclidean geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a gravitational field, at least if we attribute the length 1 to the rod in all positions and in every orientation. Hence the idea of a straight line also loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a position to define exactly the co-ordinates  relative to the disc by means of the method used in discussing the special theory, and as long as the co-ordinates and times of events have not been defined, we cannot assign an exact meaning to the natural laws in which these occur.\n\nThus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity would appear to be called in question. In reality we must make a subtle detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general relativity exactly. I shall prepare the reader for this in the following paragraphs.\n\n1The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increases proportionally to the distance from the centre as we proceed outwards. \u2191\n\n2Throughout this consideration we have to use the Galileian (non-rotating) system K as reference-body, since we may only assume the validity of the results of the special theory of relativity relative to K (relative to K\u2032 a gravitational field prevails). \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXXIV\nEuclidean and Non-Euclidean Continuum\nThe surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. I can get from any one point on this table to any other point by passing continuously from one point to a \u201cneighbouring\u201d one, and repeating this process a (large) number of times, or, in other words, by going from point to point without executing \u201cjumps.\u201d I am sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by \u201cneighbouring\u201d and by \u201cjumps\u201d (if he is not too pedantic). We express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a continuum.\n\nLet us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length have been made, their lengths being small compared with the dimensions of the marble slab. When I say they are of equal length, I mean that one can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping. We next lay four of these little rods on the marble slab so that they constitute a quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are equally long. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we make use of a little testing-rod. To this square we add similar ones, each of which has one rod in common with the first. We proceed in like manner with each of these squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with squares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs to two squares and each corner to four squares.\n\nIt is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without getting into the greatest difficulties. We only need to think of the following. If at any moment three squares meet at a corner, then two sides of the fourth square are already laid, and, as a consequence, the arrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is already completely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. If they are equal of their own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble slab and of the little rods, about which I can only be thankfully surprised. We must experience many such surprises if the construction is to be successful.\n\nIf everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the points of the marble slab constitute a Euclidean continuum with respect to the little rod, which has been used as a \u201cdistance\u201d (line-interval). By choosing one corner of a square as \u201corigin\u201d I can characterise every other corner of a square with reference to this origin by means of two numbers. I only need state how many rods I must pass over when, starting from the origin, I proceed towards the \u201cright\u201d and then \u201cupwards,\u201d in order to arrive at the corner of the square under consideration. These two numbers are then the \u201cCartesian co-ordinates\u201d of this corner with reference to the \u201cCartesian co-ordinate system\u201d which is determined by the arrangement of little rods.\n\nBy making use of the following modification of this abstract experiment, we recognise that there must also be cases in which the experiment would be unsuccessful. We shall suppose that the rods \u201cexpand\u201d by an amount proportional to the increase of temperature. We heat the central part of the marble slab, but not the periphery, in which case two of our little rods can still be brought into coincidence at every position on the table. But our construction of squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating, because the little rods on the central region of the table expand, whereas those on the outer part do not.\n\nWith reference to our little rods\u2014defined as unit lengths\u2014the marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and we are also no longer in the position of defining Cartesian co-ordinates directly with their aid, since the above construction can no longer be carried out. But since there are other things which are not influenced in a similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain the point of view that the marble slab is a \u201cEuclidean continuum.\u201d This can be done in a satisfactory manner by making a more subtle stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths.\n\nBut if rods of every kind (i.e. of every material) were to behave in the same way as regards the influence of temperature when they are on the variably heated marble slab, and if we had no other means of detecting the effect of temperature than the geometrical behaviour of our rods in experiments analogous to the one described above, then our best plan would be to assign the distance one to two points on the slab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to coincide with these two points; for how else should we define the distance without our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly arbitrary? The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be discarded, and replaced by another which does not assume the validity of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies.1 The reader will notice that the situation depicted here corresponds to the one brought about by the general postulate of relativity (Section XXIII).\n\n1Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the following form. If we are given a surface (e.g. an ellipsoid) in Euclidean three-dimensional space, then there exists for this surface a two-dimensional geometry, just as much as for a plane surface. Gauss undertook the task of treating this two-dimensional geometry from first principles, without making use of the fact that the surface belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we imagine constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar to that above with the marble slab), we should find that different laws hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane geometry. The surface is not a Euclidean continuum with respect to the rods, and we cannot define Cartesian co-ordinates in the surface. Gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed out the way to the method of Riemann of treating multi-dimensional, non-Euclidean continuum. Thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXXV\nGaussian Co-Ordinates\nFig. 4.\nFig. 4.\n\n\nAccording to Gauss, this combined analytical and geometrical mode of handling the problem can be arrived at in the following way. We imagine a system of arbitrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn on the surface of the table. These we designate as u-curves, and we indicate each of them by means of a number. The curves ,  and  are drawn in the diagram. Between the curves  and  we must imagine an infinitely large number to be drawn, all of which correspond to real numbers lying between 1 and 2. We have then a system of u-curves, and this \u201cinfinitely dense\u201d system covers the whole surface of the table. These u-curves must not intersect each other, and through each point of the surface one and only one curve must pass. Thus a perfectly definite value of u belongs to every point on the surface of the marble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of v-curves drawn on the surface. These satisfy the same conditions as the u-curves, they are provided with numbers in a corresponding manner, and they may likewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a value of u and a value of v belong to every point on the surface of the table. We call these two numbers the co-ordinates of the surface of the table (Gaussian co-ordinates). For example, the point P in the diagram has the Gaussian co-ordinates , . Two neighbouring points P and  on the surface then correspond to the co-ordinates\n\nwhere du and dv signify very small numbers. In a similar manner we may indicate the distance (line-interval) between P and P\u2032, as measured with a little rod, by means of the very small number ds. Then according to Gauss we have\n\nwhere , are magnitudes which depend in a perfectly definite way on u and v. The magnitudes ,  and , determine the behaviour of the rods relative to the u-curves and v-curves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. For the case in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean continuum with reference to the measuring-rods, but only in this case, it is possible to draw the u-curves and v-curves and to attach numbers to them, in such a manner, that we simply have:\n\n\nUnder these conditions, the u-curves and v-curves are straight lines in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to each other. Here the Gaussian coordinates are simply Cartesian ones. It is clear that Gauss co-ordinates are nothing more than an association of two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered, of such a nature that numerical values differing very slightly from each other are associated with neighbouring points \u201cin space.\u201d\n\nSo far, these considerations hold for a continuum of two dimensions. But the Gaussian method can be applied also to a continuum of three, four or more dimensions. If, for instance, a continuum of four dimensions be supposed available, we may represent it in the following way. With every point of the continuum, we associate arbitrarily four numbers, , which are known as \u201cco-ordinates.\u201d Adjacent points correspond to adjacent values of the coordinates. If a distance ds is associated with the adjacent points P and , this distance being measurable and well-defined from a physical point of view, then the following formula holds:\n\nwhere the magnitudes , etc., have values which vary with the position in the continuum. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean one is it possible to associate the co-ordinates . with the points of the continuum so that we have simply\n\n\nIn this case relations hold in the four-dimensional continuum which are analogous to those holding in our three-dimensional measurements.\n\nHowever, the Gauss treatment for  which we have given above is not always possible. It is only possible when sufficiently small regions of the continuum under consideration may be regarded as Euclidean continua. For example, this obviously holds in the case of the marble slab of the table and local variation of temperature. The temperature is practically constant for a small part of the slab, and thus the geometrical behaviour of the rods is almost as it ought to be according to the rules of Euclidean geometry. Hence the imperfections of the construction of squares in the previous section do not show themselves clearly until this construction is extended over a considerable portion of the surface of the table.\n\nWe can sum this up as follows: Gauss invented a method for the mathematical treatment of continua in general, in which \u201csize-relations\u201d (\u201cdistances\u201d between neighbouring points) are defined. To every point of a continuum are assigned as many numbers (Gaussian coordinates) as the continuum has dimensions. This is done in such a way, that only one meaning can be attached to the assignment, and that numbers (Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an indefinitely small amount are assigned to adjacent points. The Gaussian coordinate system is a logical generalisation of the Cartesian co-ordinate system. It is also applicable to non-Euclidean continua, but only when, with respect to the defined \u201csize\u201d or \u201cdistance,\u201d small parts of the continuum under consideration behave more nearly like a Euclidean system, the smaller the part of the continuum under our notice.\n\n[Contents]\nXXVI\nThe Space-Time Continuum of the Special Theory of Relativity Considered as a Euclidean Continuum\nWe are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of Minkowski, which was only vaguely indicated in Section XVII. In accordance with the special theory of relativity, certain co-ordinate systems are given preference for the description of the four-dimensional, space-time continuum. We called these \u201cGalileian co-ordinate systems.\u201d For these systems, the four co-ordinates , which determine an event or\u2014in other words, a point of the four-dimensional continuum\u2014are defined physically in a simple manner, as set forth in detail in the first part of this book. For the transition from one Galileian system to another, which is moving uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz transformation are valid. These last form the basis for the derivation of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in themselves they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of the law of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of reference.\n\nMinkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following simple conditions. Let us consider two neighbouring events, the relative position of which in the four-dimensional continuum is given with respect to a Galileian reference-body K by the space co-ordinate differences  and the time-difference dt. With reference to a second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding differences for these two events are . Then these magnitudes always fulfil the condition1.\n\n\nThe validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this condition. We can express this as follows: The magnitude\n\nwhich belongs to two adjacent points of the four-dimensional space-time continuum, has the same value for all selected (Galileian) reference-bodies. If we replace , , by , we also obtain the result that\n\nis independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the magnitude ds the \u201cdistance\u201d apart of the two events or four-dimensional points.\n\nThus, if we choose as time-variable the imaginary variable  instead of the real quantity t, we can regard the space-time continium\u2014in accordance with the special theory of relativity\u2014as a \u201cEuclidean\u201d four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows from the considerations of the preceding section.\n\n1Cf. Appendixes I and II. The relations which are derived there for the co-ordinates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate differences, and thus also for co-ordinate differentials (indefinitely small differences). \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXXVII\nThe Space-Time Continuum of the General Theory of Relativity is Not a Euclidean Continuum\nIn the first part of this book we were able to make use of space-time co-ordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical interpretation, and which, according to Section XXVI, can be regarded as four-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. This was possible on the basis of the law of the constancy of the velocity of light. But according to Section XXI the general theory of relativity cannot retain this law. On the contrary, we arrived at the result that according to this latter theory the velocity of light must always depend on the co-ordinates when a gravitational field is present. In connection with a specific illustration in Section XXIII, we found that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition of the coordinates and the time, which led us to our objective in the special theory of relativity.\n\nIn view of the results of these considerations we are led to the conviction that, according to the general principle of relativity, the space-time continuum cannot be regarded as a Euclidean one, but that here we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with local variations of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance as an example of a two-dimensional continuum. Just as it was there impossible to construct a Cartesian co-ordinate system from equal rods, so here it is impossible to build up a system (reference-body) from rigid bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature that measuring-rods and clocks, arranged rigidly with respect to one another, shall indicate position and time directly. Such was the essence of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section XXIII.\n\nBut the considerations of Sections XXV and XXVI show us the way to surmount this difficulty. We refer the four-dimensional space-time continuum in an arbitrary manner to Gauss co-ordinates. We assign to every point of the continuum (event) four numbers,  (co-ordinates), which have not the least direct physical significance, but only serve the purpose of numbering the points of the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. This arrangement does not even need to be of such a kind that we must regard , as \u201cspace\u201d co-ordinates and , as a \u201ctime\u201d co-ordinate.\n\nThe reader may think that such a description of the world would be quite inadequate. What does it mean to assign to an event the particular co-ordinates , if in themselves these co-ordinates have no significance? More careful consideration shows, however, that this anxiety is unfounded. Let us consider, for instance, a material point with any kind of motion. If this point had only a momentary existence without duration, then it would to described in space-time by a single system of values . Thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an infinitely large number of such systems of values, the co-ordinate values of which are so close together as to give continuity; corresponding to the material point, we thus have a (uni-dimensional) line in the four-dimensional continuum. In the same way, any such lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion. The only statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical existence are in reality the statements about their encounters. In our mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expressed in the fact that the two lines which represent the motions of the points in question have a particular system of co-ordinate values, , in common. After mature consideration the reader will doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the only actual evidence of a time-space nature with which we meet in physical statements.\n\nWhen we were describing the motion of a material point relative to a body of reference, we stated nothing more than the encounters of this point with particular points of the reference-body. We can also determine the corresponding values of the time by the observation of encounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction with the observation of the encounter of the hands of clocks with particular points on the dials. It is just the same in the case of space-measurements by means of measuring-rods, as a little consideration will show.\n\nThe following statements hold generally: Every physical description resolves itself into a number of statements, each of which refers to the space-time coincidence of two events A and B. In terms of Gaussian co-ordinates, every such statement is expressed by the agreement of their four co-ordinates . Thus in reality, the description of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss co-ordinates completely replaces the description with the aid of a body of reference, without suffering from the defects of the latter mode of description; it is not tied down to the Euclidean character of the continuum which has to be represented.\n\n[Contents]\nXXVIII\nExact Formulation of the General Principle of Relativity\nWe are now in a position to replace the provisional formulation of the general principle of relativity given in Section XVIII by an exact formulation. The form there used, \u201cAll bodies of reference  etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their state of motion,\u201d cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid reference-bodies, in the sense of the method followed in the special theory of relativity, is in general not possible in space-time description. The Gauss co-ordinate system has to take the place of the body of reference. The following statement corresponds to the fundamental idea of the general principle of relativity: \u201cAll Gaussian co-ordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of nature.\u201d\n\nWe can state this general principle of relativity in still another form, which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is when in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of relativity. According to the special theory of relativity, the equations which express the general laws of nature pass over into equations of the same form when, by making use of the Lorentz transformation, we replace the space-time variables , of a (Galileian) reference-body K by the space-time variables , of a new reference-body K\u2032. According to the general theory of relativity, on the other hand, by application of arbitrary substitutions of the Gauss variables , the equations must pass over into equations of the same form; for every transformation (not only the Lorentz transformation) corresponds to the transition of one Gauss co-ordinate system into another.\n\nIf we desire to adhere to our \u201cold-time\u201d three-dimensional view of things, then we can characterise the development which is being undergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity as follows: The special theory of relativity has reference to Galileian domains, i.e. to those in which no gravitational field exists. In this connection a Galileian reference-body serves as body of reference, i.e. a rigid body the state of motion of which is so chosen that the Galileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of \u201cisolated\u201d material points holds relatively to it.\n\nCertain considerations suggest that we should refer the same Galileian domains to non-Galileian reference-bodies also. A gravitational field of a special kind is then present with respect to these bodies (cf. Sections XX and XXIII).\n\nIn gravitational fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with Euclidean properties; thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is of no avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of clocks is also influenced by gravitational fields, and in such a way that a physical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of clocks has by no means the same degree of plausibility as in the special theory of relativity.\n\nFor this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are used, which are as a whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer alterations in form ad lib. during their motion. Clocks, for which the law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the definition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point on the non-rigid reference-body. These clocks satisfy only the one condition, that the \u201creadings\u201d which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an indefinitely small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might appropriately be termed a \u201creference-mollusc\u201d, is in the main equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system chosen arbitrarily. That which gives the \u201cmollusc\u201d a certain comprehensibility as compared with the Gauss co-ordinate system is the (really unjustified) formal retention of the separate existence of the space co-ordinates as opposed to the time co-ordinate. Every point on the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point which is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc is considered as reference-body. The general principle of relativity requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice of mollusc.\n\nThe great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on the laws of nature in consequence of what we have seen above.\n\n[Contents]\nXXIX\nThe Solution of the Problem of Gravitation on the Basis of the General Principle of Relativity\nIf the reader has followed all our previous considerations, he will have no further difficulty in understanding the methods leading to the solution of the problem of gravitation.\n\nWe start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, i.e. a domain in which there is no gravitational field relative to the Galileian reference-body K. The behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks with reference to K is known from the special theory of relativity, likewise the behaviour of \u201cisolated\u201d material points; the latter move uniformly and in straight lines.\n\nNow let us refer this domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to a \u201cmollusc\u201d as reference-body K\u2032. Then with respect to K\u2032 there is a gravitational field G (of a particular kind). We learn the behavior of measuring-rods and clocks and also of freely-moving material points with reference to K\u2032 simply by mathematical transformation. We interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of measuring-rods, docks and material points u nder the influence of the gravitational field G. Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis: that the influence of the gravitational field on measuring-rods, clocks and freely-moving material points continues to take place according to the same laws, even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is not derivable from the Galileian special case, simply by means of a transformation of co-ordinates.\n\nThe next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the gravitational field G, which was derived from the Galileian special case simply by transformation of the coordinates. This behaviour is formulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter how the reference-body (mollusc) used in the description may be chosen.\n\nThis law is not yet the general law of the gravitational field, since the gravitational field under consideration is of a special kind. In order to find out the general law-of-field of gravitation we still require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above. This can be obtained without caprice, however, by taking into consideration the following demands:\n\n(a)The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general postulate of relativity.\n(b)If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only its inertial mass, and thus according to Section XV only its energy is of importance for its effect in exciting a field.\n(c)Gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of the conservation of energy (and of impulse).\n\nFinally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine the influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those processes which take place according to known laws when a gravitational field is absent i.e. which have already been fitted into the frame of the special theory of relativity. In this connection we proceed in principle according to the method which has already been explained for measuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material points.\n\nThe theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general postulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty; nor in removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought to light in Section XXI; nor in interpreting the empirical law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass; but it has also already explained a result of observation in astronomy, against which classical mechanics is powerless.\n\nIf we confine the application of the theory to the case where the gravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all masses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities which are small compared with the velocity of light, we then obtain as a first approximation the Newtonian theory. Thus the latter theory is obtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually attracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. If we increase the accuracy of the calculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their appearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test of observation owing to their smallness.\n\nWe must draw attention here to one of these deviations. According to Newton\u2019s theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which would permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves and the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we correct the observed motion of the planets for these two influences, and if Newton\u2019s theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the orbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the fixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy, has been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the planet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury, after it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the orbital motion. The value obtained for this rotary movement of the orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured to be correct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of hypotheses which have little probability, and which were devised solely for this purpose.\n\nOn the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that the ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the manner indicated above; that for all the planets, with the exception of Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detected with the delicacy of observation possible at the present time; but that in the case of Mercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a result which is strictly in agreement with observation.\n\nApart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two deductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observation, to wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the sun1, and a displacement of the spectral lines of light reaching us from large stars, as compared with the corresponding lines for light produced in an analogous manner terrestrially (i.e. by the same kind of atom)2. These two deductions from the theory have both been confirmed.\n\n1First observed by Eddington and others in 1919. (Cf. Appendix III, pp. 126\u2013129). \u2191\n\n2Established by Adams in 1924.

If we ponder over the question as to how the universe, considered as a whole, is to be regarded, the first answer that suggests itself to us is surely this: As regards space (and time) the universe is infinite. There are stars everywhere, so that the density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless on the average everywhere the same. In other words: However far we might travel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated swarm of fixed stars of approximately the same kind and density.\n\nThis view is not in harmony with the theory of Newton. The latter theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre in which the density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed outwards from this centre the group-density of the stars should diminish, until finally, at great distances, it is succeeded by an infinite region of emptiness. The stellar universe ought to be a finite island in the infinite ocean of space1.\n\nThis conception is in itself not very satisfactory. It is still less satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by the stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are perpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and without ever again coming into interaction with other objects of nature. Such a finite material universe would be destined to become gradually but systematically impoverished.\n\nIn order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modification of Newton\u2019s law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force of attraction between two masses diminishes more rapidly than would result from the inverse square law. In this way it is possible for the mean density of matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity, without infinitely large gravitational fields being produced. We thus free ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material universe ought to possess something of the nature of a centre. Of course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties mentioned, at the cost of a modification and complication of Newton\u2019s law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without our being able to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to the others; for any one of these laws would be founded just as little on more general theoretical principles as is the law of Newton.\n\n1Proof.\u2014According to the theory of Newton, the number of \u201clines of force\u201d which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is proportional to the mass m. If, on the average, the mass density  is constant throughout the universe, then a sphere of volume V will enclose the average mass . Thus the number of lines of force passing through the surface F of the sphere into its interior is proportional to . For unit area of the surface of the sphere the number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional to  or to . Hence the intensity of the field at the surface would ultimately become infinite with increasing radius R of the sphere, which is impossible. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nXXXI\nThe Possibility of a \u201cFinite\u201d and yet \u201cUnbounded\u201d Universe\nBut speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite another direction. The development of non-Euclidean geometry led to the recognition of the fact, that we can cast doubt on the infiniteness of our space without coming into conflict with the laws of thought or with experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by Helmholtz and Poincar\u00e9, whereas I can only touch on them briefly here.\n\nIn the first place, we imagine an existence in two dimensional space. Flat beings with flat implements, and in particular flat rigid measuring-rods, are free to move in a plane. For them nothing exists outside of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselves and to their flat \u201cthings\u201d is the all-inclusive reality of their plane. In particular, the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry can be carried out by means of the rods e.g. the lattice construction, considered in Section XXIV. In contrast to ours, the universe of these beings is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to infinity. In their universe there is room for an infinite number of identical squares made up of rods, i.e. its volume (surface) is infinite. If these beings say their universe is \u201cplane,\u201d there is sense in the statement, because they mean that they can perform the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry with their rods. In this connection the individual rods always represent the same distance, independently of their position.\n\nLet us consider now a second two-dimensional existence, but this time on a spherical surface instead of on a plane. The flat beings with their measuring-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and they are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observation extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are these beings able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry and their rods withal as the realisation of \u201cdistance\u201d? They cannot do this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will obtain a curve, which we \u201cthree-dimensional beings\u201d designate as a great circle, i.e. a self-contained line of definite finite length, which can be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this universe has a finite area that can be compared with the area, of a square constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of these beings is finite and yet has no limits.\n\nBut the spherical-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean universe. They can convince themselves of this on every part of their \u201cworld,\u201d provided they do not use too small a piece of it. Starting from a point, they draw \u201cstraight lines\u201d (arcs of circles as judged in three dimensional space) of equal length in all directions. They will call the line joining the free ends of these lines a \u201ccircle.\u201d For a plane surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, both lengths being measured with the same rod, is, according to Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value , which is independent of the diameter of the circle. On their spherical surface our flat beings would find for this ratio the value\n\ni.e. a smaller value than , the difference being the more considerable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison with the radius R of the \u201cworld-sphere.\u201d By means of this relation the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe (\u201cworld\u201d), even when only a relatively small part of their world-sphere is available for their measurements. But if this part is very small indeed, they will no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a spherical \u201cworld\u201d and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of a spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of the same size.\n\nThus if the spherical surface beings are living on a planet of which the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the spherical universe, they have no means of determining whether they are living in a finite or in an infinite universe, because the \u201cpiece of universe\u201d to which they have access is in both cases practically plane, or Euclidean. It follows directly from this discussion, that for our sphere-beings the circumference of a circle first increases with the radius until the \u201ccircumference of the universe\u201d is reached, and that it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for still further increasing values of the radius. During this process the area of the circle continues to increase more and more, until finally it becomes equal to the total area of the whole \u201cworld-sphere.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our \u201cbeings\u201d on a sphere rather than on another closed surface. But this choice has its justification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is unique in possessing the property that all points on it are equivalent. I admit that the ratio of the circumference c of a circle to its radius r depends on r, but for a given value of r it is the same for all points of the \u201cworld-sphere\u201d; in other words, the \u201cworld-sphere\u201d is a \u201csurface of constant curvature.\u201d\n\nTo this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional analogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical space which was discovered by Riemann. Its points are likewise all equivalent. It possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its \u201cradius\u201d (). Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To imagine a space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our \u201cspace\u201d experience, i.e. of experience that we can have in the movement of \u201crigid\u201d bodies. In this sense we can imagine a spherical space.\n\nSuppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a point, and mark off from each of these the distance r with a measuring-rod. All the free end-points of these lengths lie on a spherical surface. We can specially measure up the area (F) of this surface by means of a square made up of measuring-rods. If the universe is Euclidean, then ; if it is spherical, then F is always less than . With increasing values of r, F increases from zero up to a maximum value which is determined by the \u201cworld-radius,\u201d but for still further increasing values of r, the area gradually diminishes to zero. At first, the straight lines which radiate from the starting point diverge farther and farther from one another, but later they approach each other, and finally they run together again at a \u201ccounter-point\u201d to the starting point. Under such conditions they have traversed the whole spherical space. It is easily seen that the three-dimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the two-dimensional spherical surface. It is finite (i.e. of finite volume), and has no bounds.\n\nIt may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space: \u201celliptical space.\u201d It can be regarded as a curved space in which the two \u201ccounter-points\u201d are identical (indistinguishable from each other). An elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent as a curved universe possessing central symmetry.\n\nIt follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without limits are conceivable. From amongst these, the spherical space (and the elliptical) excels in its simplicity, since all points on it are equivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting question arises for astronomers and physicists, and that is whether the universe in which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite in the manner of the spherical universe. Our experience is far from being sufficient to enable us to answer this question. But the general theory of relativity permits of our answering it with a moderate degree of certainty, and in this connection the difficulty mentioned in Section XXX finds its solution.\n\n[Contents]\nXXXII\nThe Structure of Space According to the General Theory of Relativity\nAccording to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical properties of space are not independent, but they are determined by matter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical structure of the universe only if we base our considerations on the state of the matter as being something that is known. We know from experience that, for a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of light. We can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the nature of the universe as a whole, if we treat the matter as being at rest.\n\nWe already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields, i.e. by the distribution of matter. This in itself is sufficient to exclude the possibility of the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our universe. But it is conceivable that our universe differs only slightly from a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more probable, since calculations show that the metrics of surrounding space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even of the magnitude of our sun. We might imagine that, as regards geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is irregularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs appreciably from a plane: something like the rippled surface of a lake. Such a universe might fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean universe. As regards its space it would be infinite. But calculation shows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the average density of matter would necessarily be nil. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited by matter everywhere; it would present to us that unsatisfactory picture which we portrayed in Section XXX.\n\nIf we are to have in the universe an average density of matter which differs from zero, however small may be that difference, then the universe cannot be quasi-Euclidean. On the contrary, the results of calculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, the universe would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). Since in reality the detailed distribution of matter is not uniform, the real universe will deviate in individual parts from the spherical, i.e. the universe will be quasi-spherical. But it will be necessarily finite. In fact, the theory supplies us with a simple connection1 between the space-expanse of the universe and the average density of matter in it.\n\n1For the \u201cradius\u201d R of the universe we obtain the equation\n\n\nThe use of the C.G.S. system in this equation gives ;  is the average density of the matter and  is a constant connected with the Newtonian constant of gravitation. \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nAPPENDIX I\nSimple Derivation of the Lorentz Transformation [Supplementary to Section XI]\nFor the relative orientation of the co-ordinate systems indicated in Fig. 2, the x-axes of both systems permanently coincide. In the present case we can divide the problem into parts by considering first only events which are localised on the x-axis. Any such event is represented with respect to the co-ordinate system K by the abscissa x and the time t, and with respect to the system K\u2032 by the abscissa x\u2032 and the time t\u2032. We require to find x\u2032 and t\u2032 when x and t are given.\n\nA light-signal, which is proceeding along the positive axis of x, is transmitted according to the equation\n\nor\n\t(1)\nSince the same light-signal has to be transmitted relative to K\u2032 with the velocity c, the propagation relative to the system K\u2032 will be represented by the analogous formula\n\t(2)\n\nThose space-time points (events) which satisfy (1) must also satisfy (2). Obviously this will be the case when the relation\n\t(3)\nis fulfilled in general, where  indicates a constant; for, according to (3), the disappearance of  involves the disappearance of .\n\nIf we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which are being transmitted along the negative x-axis, we obtain the condition\n\t(4)\n\nBy adding (or subtracting) equations (3) and (4), and introducing for convenience the constants a and b in place of the constants  and , where\n\nand\n\nwe obtain the equations\n\t(5)\n\nWe should thus have the solution of our problem, if the constants a and b were known. These result from the following discussion.\n\nFor the origin of K\u2032 we have permanently , and hence according to the first of the equations (5)\n\n\nIf we call v the velocity with which the origin of K\u2032 is moving relative to K, we then have\n\t(6)\n\nThe same value v can be obtained from equations (5), if we calculate the velocity of another point of K\u2032 relative to K, or the velocity (directed towards the negative x-axis) of a point of K with respect to K\u2032. In short, we can designate v as the relative velocity of the two systems.\n\nFurthermore, the principle of relativity teaches us that, as judged from K, the length of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest with reference to K\u2032 must be exactly the same as the length, as judged from K\u2032, of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest relative to K. In order to see how the points of the x-axis appear as viewed from K, we only require to take a \u201csnapshot\u201d of K\u2032 from K; this means that we have to insert a particular value of t (time of K), e.g. . For this value of t we then obtain from the first of the equations (5)\n\n\nTwo points of the x\u2032-axis which are separated by the distance  when measured in the K\u2032 system are thus separated in our instantaneous photograph by the distance\n\t(7)\nBut if the snapshot be taken from , and if we eliminate t from the equations (5), taking into account the expression (6), we obtain\n\nFrom this we conclude that two points on the x-axis separated by the distance I (relative to K) will be represented on our snapshot by the distance\n\t(7a)\nBut from what has been said, the two snapshots must be identical; hence  in (7) must be equal to  in (7a), so that we obtain\n\t(7b)\n\nThe equations (6) and (7b) determine the constants a and b. By inserting the values of these constants in (5), we obtain the first and the fourth of the equations given in Section XI.\n\t(8)\n\nThus we have obtained the Lorentz transformation for events on the x-axis. It satisfies the condition\n\t(8a)\n\nThe extension of this result, to include events which take place outside the x-axis, is obtained by retaining equations (8) and supplementing them by the relations\n\t(9)\n\nIn this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo for rays of light of arbitrary direction, both for the system K and for the system K\u2032. This may be shown in the following manner.\n\nWe suppose a light-signal sent out from the origin of K at the time . It will be propagated according to the equation\n\nor, if we square this equation, according to the equation\n\t(10)\n\nIt is required by the law of propagation of light, in conjunction with the postulate of relativity, that the transmission of the signal in question should take place\u2014as judged from K\u2032\u2014in accordance with the corresponding formula\n\nor,\n\t(10a)\n\nIn order that equation (10a) may be a consequence of equation (10), we must have\n\t(11)\n\nSince equation (8a) must hold for points on the x-axis, we thus have . It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation really satisfies equation (11) for ; for (11) is a consequence of (8a) and (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). We have thus derived the Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation represented by (8) and (9) still requires to be generalised. Obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of K\u2032 be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of K. It is also not essential that the velocity of translation of K\u2032 with respect to K should be in the direction of the x-axis. A simple consideration shows that we are able to construct the Lorentz transformation in this general sense from two kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz transformations in the special sense and from purely spatial transformations. which corresponds to the replacement of the rectangular co-ordinate system by a new system with its axes pointing in other directions.\n\nMathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz transformation thus:\n\nIt expresses , in terms of linear homogeneous functions of , of such a kind that the relation\n\t(11a)\nis satisfied identically. That is to say: If we substitute their expressions in , in place of , on the left-hand side, then the left-hand side of (11a) agrees with the right-hand side.\n\n[Contents]\nAPPENDIX II\nMinkowski\u2019s Four-Dimensional Space (\u201cWorld\u201d) [Supplementary to Section XVII]\nWe can characterise the Lorentz transformation still more simply if we introduce the imaginary  in place of t, as time-variable. If, in accordance with this, we insert\n\nand similarly for the accented system K\u2032, then the condition which is identically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus:\n\t(12)\nThat is, by the afore-mentioned choice of \u201ccoordinates,\u201d (11a) is transformed into this equation.\n\nWe see from (12) that the imaginary time co-ordinate , enters into the condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space co-ordinates . It is due to this fact that, according to the theory of relativity, the \u201ctime\u201d , enters into natural laws in the same form as the space co-ordinates .\n\nA four-dimensional continuum described by the \u201cco-ordinates\u201d , was called \u201cworld\u201d by Minkowski, who also termed a point-event a \u201cworld-point.\u201d From a \u201chappening\u201d in three-dimensional space, physics becomes, as it were, an \u201cexistence \u201cin the four-dimensional \u201cworld.\u201d\n\nThis four-dimensional \u201cworld\u201d bears a close similarity to the three-dimensional \u201cspace\u201d of (Euclidean) analytical geometry. If we introduce into the latter a new Cartesian co-ordinate system () with the same origin, then , are linear homogeneous functions of  which identically satisfy the equation\n\n\nThe analogy with (12) is a complete one. We can regard Minkowski\u2019s \u201cworld\u201d in a formal manner as a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with an imaginary time coordinate); the Lorentz transformation corresponds to a \u201crotation\u201d of the co-ordinate system in the four-dimensional \u201cworld.\u201d\n\n[Contents]\nAPPENDIX III\nThe Experimental Confirmation of the General Theory of Relativity\nFrom a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous process of induction. Theories are evolved and are expressed in short compass as statements of a large number of individual observations in the form of empirical laws, from which the general laws can be ascertained by comparison. Regarded in this way, the development of a science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified catalogue. It is, as it were, a purely empirical enterprise.\n\nBut this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual process; for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and deductive thought in the development of an exact science. As soon as a science has emerged from its initial stages, theoretical advances are no longer achieved merely by a process of arrangement. Guided by empirical data, the investigator rather develops a system of thought which, in general, is built up logically from a small number of fundamental assumptions, the so-called axioms. We call such a system of thought a theory. The theory finds the justification for its existence in the fact that it correlates a large number of single observations, and it is just here that the \u201ctruth\u201d of the theory lies.\n\nCorresponding to the same complex of empirical data, there may be several theories, which differ from one another to a considerable extent. But as regards the deductions from the theories which are capable of being tested, the agreement between the theories may be so complete that it becomes difficult to find any deductions in which the two theories differ from each other. As an example, a case of general interest is available in the province of biology, in the Darwinian theory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for existence, and in the theory of development which is based on the hypothesis of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters.\n\nWe have another instance of far-reaching agreement between the deductions from two theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand, and the general theory of relativity on the other. This agreement goes so far, that up to the present we have been able to find only a few deductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable of investigation, and to which the physics of pre-relativity days does not also lead, and this despite the profound difference in the fundamental assumptions of the two theories. In what follows, we shall again consider these important deductions, and we shall also discuss the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto been obtained.\n\n[Contents]\n(a) Motion of the Perihelion of Mercury\nAccording to Newtonian mechanics and Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, a planet which is revolving round the sun would describe an ellipse round the latter, or, more correctly, round the common centre of gravity of the sun and the planet. In such a system, the sun, or the common centre of gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital ellipse in such a manner that, in the course of a planet-year, the distance sun-planet grows from a minimum to a maximum, and then decreases again to a minimum. If instead of Newton\u2019s law we insert a somewhat different law of attraction into the calculation, we find that, according to this new law, the motion would still take place in such a manner that the distance sun-planet exhibits periodic variations; but in this case the angle described by the line joining sun and planet during such a period (from perihelion\u2014closest proximity to the sun\u2014to perihelion) would differ from . The line of the orbit would not then be a closed one but in the course of time it would fill up an annular part of the orbital plane, viz. between the circle of least and the circle of greatest distance of the planet from the sun.\n\nAccording also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of course from the theory of Newton, a small variation from the Newton-Kepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and in such a way, that the angle described by the radius sun-planet between one perihelion and the next should exceed that corresponding to one complete revolution by an amount given by\n\n\n(N.B.\u2014One complete revolution corresponds to the angle  in the absolute angular measure customary in physics, and the above expression given the amount by which the radius sun-planet exceeds this angle during the interval between one perihelion and the next.) In this expression a represents the major semi-axis of the ellipse, e its eccentricity, c the velocity of light, and T the period of revolution of the planet. Our result may also be stated as follows: According to the general theory of relativity, the major axis of the ellipse rotates round the sun in the same sense as the orbital motion of the planet. Theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43 seconds of arc per century for the planet Mercury, but for the other planets of our solar system its magnitude should be so small that it would necessarily escape detection.1\n\nIn point of fact, astronomers have found that the theory of Newton does not suffice to calculate the observed motion of Mercury with an exactness corresponding to that of the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time. After taking account of all the disturbing influences exerted on Mercury by the remaining planets, it was found (Leverrier: 1859; and Newcomb: 1895) that an unexplained perihelial movement of the orbit of Mercury remained over, the amount of which does not differ sensibly from the above mentioned +43 seconds of arc per century. The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to a few seconds only.\n\n[Contents]\n(b) Deflection of Light by a Gravitational Field\nIn Section XXII it has been already mentioned that according to the general theory of relativity, a ray of light will experience a curvature of its path when passing through a gravitational field, this curvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a body which is projected through a gravitational field. As a result of this theory, we should expect that a ray of light which is passing close to a heavenly body would be deviated towards the latter. For a ray of light which passes the sun at a distance of  sun-radii from its centre, the angle of deflection (a) should amount to\n\n\nIt may be added that, according to the theory, half of Figure 05 this deflection is produced by the Newtonian field of attraction of the sun, and the other half by the geometrical modification (\u201ccurvature\u201d) of space caused by the sun.\n\nFig. 5\nFig. 5\n\n\nThis result admits of an experimental test by means of the photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. The only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the light from the sun that the stars situated near the sun\u2019s disc are invisible. The predicted effect can be seen clearly from the accompanying diagram. If the sun (S) were not present, a star which is practically infinitely distant would be seen in the direction , as observed from the earth. But as a consequence of the deflection of light from the star by the sun, the star will be seen in the direction , i.e. at a somewhat greater distance from the centre of the sun than corresponds to its real position.\n\nIn practice, the question is tested in the following way. The stars in the neighborhood of the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse. In addition, a second photograph of the same stars is taken when the sun is situated at another position in the sky, i.e. a few months earlier or later. As compared with the standard photograph, the positions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph ought to appear displaced radially outwards (away from the centre of the sun) by an amount corresponding to the angle a.\n\nWe are indebted to the [British] Royal Society and to the Royal Astronomical Society for the investigation of this important deduction. Undaunted by the [first world] war and by difficulties of both a material and a psychological nature aroused by the war, these societies equipped two expeditions\u2014to Sobral (Brazil), and to the island of Principe (West Africa)\u2014and sent several of Britain\u2019s most celebrated astronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin, Davidson), in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. The relative discrepancies to be expected between the stellar photographs obtained during the eclipse and the comparison photographs amounted to a few hundredths of a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy was necessary in making the adjustments required for the taking of the photographs, and in their subsequent measurement.\n\nThe results of the measurements confirmed the theory in a thoroughly satisfactory manner. The rectangular components of the observed and of the calculated deviations of the stars (in seconds of arc) are set forth in the following table of results:\n\nNumber of\nthe Star.\tFirst Co-ordinate.\tSecond Co-ordinate.\nObserved.\tCalculated.\tObserved.\tCalculated.\n11\t-0.19\t-0.22\t+0.16\t+0.02\n5\t+0.29\t+0.31\t-0.46\t-0.43\n4\t+0.11\t+0.10\t+0.83\t+0.73\n3\t+0.22\t+0.12\t+1.00\t+0.87\n6\t+0.10\t+0.04\t+0.57\t+0.40\n10\t-0.08\t+0.09\t+0.35\t+0.32\n2\t+0.95\t+0.85\t-0.27\t-0.09\n\n[Contents]\n(c) Displacement of Spectral Lines Towards the Red\nIn Section XXIII it has been shown that in a system K\u2032 which is in rotation with regard to a Galileian system K, clocks of identical construction, and which are considered at rest with respect to the rotating reference-body, go at rates which are dependent on the positions of the clocks. We shall now examine this dependence quantitatively. A clock, which is situated at a distance r from the centre of the disc, has a velocity relative to K which is given by\n\nwhere  represents the angular velocity of rotation of the disc K\u2032 with respect to K. If , represents the number of ticks of the clock per unit time (\u201crate\u201d of the clock) relative to K when the clock is at rest, then the \u201crate\u201d of the clock (v) when it is moving relative to K with a velocity v, but at rest with respect to the disc, will, in accordance with Section XII, be given by\n\nor with sufficient accuracy by\n\nThis expression may also be stated in the following form:\n\n\nIf we represent the difference of potential of the centrifugal force between the position of the clock and the centre of the disc by , i.e. the work, considered negatively, which must be performed on the unit of mass against the centrifugal force in order to transport it from the position of the clock on the rotating disc to the centre of the disc, then we have\n\nFrom this it follows that\n\n\nIn the first place, we see from this expression that two clocks of identical construction will go at different rates when situated at different distances from the centre of the disc. This result is also valid from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with the disc.\n\nNow, as judged from the disc, the latter is in a gravitational field of potential , hence the result we have obtained will hold quite generally for gravitational fields. Furthermore, we can regard an atom which is emitting spectral lines as a clock, so that the following statement will hold:\n\nAn atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on the potential of the gravitational field in which it is situated.\n\nThe frequency of an atom situated on the surface of a heavenly body will be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of the same element which is situated in free space (or on the surface of a smaller celestial body).\n\nNow , where K is Newton\u2019s constant of gravitation, and M is the mass of the heavenly body. Thus a displacement towards the red ought to take place for spectral lines produced at the surface of stars as compared with the spectral lines of the same element produced at the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement being\n\n\nFor the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theory amounts to about two millionths of the wave-length. A trustworthy calculation is not possible in the case of the stars, because in general neither the mass M nor the radius r are known.\n\nIt is an open question whether or not this effect exists, and at the present time [1920] astronomers are working with great zeal towards the solution. Owing to the smallness of the effect in the case of the sun, it is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence. Whereas Grebe and Bachem (Bonn), as a result of their own measurements and those of Evershed and Schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands, have placed the existence of the effect almost beyond doubt, while other investigators, particularly St. John, have been led to the opposite opinion in consequence of their measurements.\n\nMean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum are certainly revealed by statistical investigations of the fixed stars; but up to the present the examination of the available data does not allow of any definite decision being arrived at, as to whether or not these displacements are to be referred in reality to the effect of gravitation. The results of observation have been collected together, and discussed in detail from the standpoint of the question which has been engaging our attention here, in a paper by E. Freundlich entitled \u201cZur Pr\u00fcfung der allgemeinen Relativit\u00e4ts-Theorie\u201d (Die Naturwissenschaften, 1919, No. 35, p. 520: Julius Springer, Berlin).\n\nAt all events, a definite decision will be reached during the next few years. If the displacement of spectral lines towards the red by the gravitational potential does not exist, then the general theory of relativity will be untenable. On the other hand, if the cause of the displacement of spectral lines be definitely traced to the gravitational potential, then the study of this displacement will furnish us with important information as to the mass of the heavenly bodies.2\n\n1Especially since the next planet Venus has an orbit that is almost an exact circle, which makes it more difficult to locate the perihelion with precision. \u2191\n\n2The displacement of spectral lines towards the red end of the spectrum was definitely established by Adams in 1924, by observations on the dense companion of Sirius, for which the effect is about thirty times greater than for the Sun. R.W.L.\u2014translator \u2191\n\n[Contents]\nAPPENDIX IV\nThe Structure of Space According to the General Theory of Relativity [Supplementary to Section XXXII]\nSince the publication of the first edition of this little book, our knowledge about the structure of space in the large (\u201ccosmological problem\u201d) has had an important development, which ought to be mentioned even in a popular presentation of the subject.\n\nMy original considerations on the subject were based on two hypotheses:\n\n(1)There exists an average density of matter in the whole of space which is everywhere the same and different from zero.\n(2)The magnitude (\u201cradius\u201d) of space is independent of time.\n\nBoth these hypotheses proved to be consistent, according to the general theory of relativity, but only after a hypothetical term was added to the field equations, a term which was not required by the theory as such nor did it seem natural from a theoretical point of view (\u201ccosmological term of the field equations\u201d).\n\nHypothesis (2) appeared unavoidable to me at the time, since I thought that one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from it.\n\nHowever, already in the twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely theoretical point of view. He realized that it was possible to preserve hypothesis (1) without introducing the less natural cosmological term into the field equations of gravitation, if one was ready to drop hypothesis (2). Namely, the original field equations admit a solution in which the \u201cworld radius\u201d depends on time (expanding space). In that sense one can say, according to Friedman, that the theory demands an expansion of space.\n\nA few years later Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the extra-galactic nebulae (\u201cmilky ways\u201d), that the spectral lines emitted showed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance of the nebulae. This can be interpreted in regard to our present knowledge only in the sense of Doppler\u2019s principle, as an expansive motion of the system of stars in the large\u2014as required, according to Friedman, by the field equations of gravitation. Hubble\u2019s discovery can, therefore, be considered to some extent as a confirmation of the theory.\n\nThere does arise, however, a strange difficulty. The interpretation of the galactic line-shift discovered by Hubble as an expansion (which can hardly be doubted from a theoretical point of view), leads to an origin of this expansion which lies \u201conly\u201d about  years ago, while physical astronomy makes it appear likely that the development of individual stars and systems of stars takes considerably longer. It is in no way known how this incongruity is to be overcome.\n\nI further want to remark that the theory of expanding space, together with the empirical data of astronomy, permit no decision to be reached about the finite or infinite character of (three-dimensional) space, while the original \u201cstatic\u201d hypothesis of space yielded the closure (finiteness) of space.\n\nColophon\nAvailability\nThis version was prepared from the version originally available from Project Gutenberg, which was prepared by Brian Basgen and is also available from the Einstein Reference Archive. The original TeX format was converted to TEI, completely reviewed against the 1921 edition available at The Internet Archive and corrected where necessary. Illustrations where obtained from the source copy to replace the original graphics, and the frontispiece drawing of Einstein by Hermann Struck from the 1921 edition was added.\n\nMetadata\nTitle:\tRelativity: The Special and General Theory\nAuthor:\tAlbert Einstein (1879\u20131955)\tInfo\nTranslator:\tRobert William Lawson (1890\u20131960)\tInfo\nIllustrator:\tHermann Struck (1876\u20131944)\tInfo\nLanguage:\tEnglish\nOriginal publication date:\t1916\nKeywords:\tRelativity\nProject Gutenberg:\t5001\nQR-code:\tQR-code of Project Gutenberg URL\nRevision History\n2018-09-26 Started.\nExternal References\nThis Project Gutenberg eBook contains external references.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n",
