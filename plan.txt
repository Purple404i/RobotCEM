The ai model should be able to accept a prompt then search for the parts in the database if its not in the database it should search the online market for the part and at 
all times search for the price of the parts before using it and then add it to the data base if not already present.If the required objects or parts are not 
found in the market place or is required to be changeed for a reason (like budget issues or user preferrence) then the model should try to search for alternatives or 
tell the user that its not possible and provide the reason and alternatives.

The ai model should understand the features of the objects/parts and then use them to create the required device with minimal modifications and be able to show and simulate
the device using the Picogk and Leap71 things inside csharp_runtime folder.

The user should be able to edit the device like in blender and in the mean time the ai model can analyse it after the user makes no 
edits for 5 minutes or asks the ai to analyse it.

We will need to create and train 2 things the Picogk CEM part and the LLM part so that its able to undestand natural language to create stuff.
Basically the ai model is the compbination of both.

A custom AI model and not a LLM from Hugging Face or any other AI models like claude, chatgpt, grok's apis are used because the pretrained
models are rate limited and less customizable and because the pretrained models don't come with the physics and engineering knowledge
and cant properly simulate them.
